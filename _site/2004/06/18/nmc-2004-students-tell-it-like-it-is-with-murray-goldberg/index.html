<ul>
  <li>it works in some courses:
–where no marks are mandatory otherwise it degenerates into “worried students”
–where real names are used
–some courses had students answering questions before profs
–difference between arts and science - less discussion in science?
Can you get to know a person online?</li>
  <li>when online in a a course, you only focus on course, face2face is more multidimensional</li>
  <li>MSN phenomena where people flame and use pseudonyms
Accessibility questions</li>
  <li>can’t afford computer</li>
  <li>can’t use computer</li>
  <li>uneven, unequal</li>
  <li>MG: it’s getting better 80% in NA have access to computer outside school
– can’t stop progress
Questions:
Jay Reese
Paradox between extra communication thru online posting yet missing face to face and like the prof “knows” you.
What are we missing non-verbal? Uncomfortable with new medium?
-MG research shows that students are familiar with one medium rather than another
-provide as much channels then you get 90%
-today only text has no gestures or voice
-trying to use it as normal medium when it’s different
-“older” people craft their posting much more than younger ones
-human contact is missing from pure distance course
-online has an anonymity factor - on one hand you are free, on the other hand you have less or altered responsibility can have a different persona
Warren Scott - UBC
What p*sses you off about elearning? Disconnect between course materials and what happens in class.
-WebCT is not used as a supplement but as a complement - it’s overwhelming - go to class twice - once with prof and once with WebCT, I K (sp?) would prefer it to be a supplement
-students have a hard time reconciling conflicts between WebCT and course notes

-information overload
-students don’t know what is relevant and what is not
-need to develop skills for research
-learning is different now
-learning how to decide what is good information
-before going to a librarian, it was easier to figure out what was “good” information</li>
  <li>
    <p>two aspects to learning
–we are here to learn 
–focus
JoEllen Parker - National Institute for Technology and Education
18 year students have different attitudes  (versus 4th year students) to conflicting sources of info due to physical development
Overtime does WebCT attitude/knowledge change?
-over 3 years you get frustrated with newbies to WebCT</p>
  </li>
  <li>People aren’t aware of the computer literacy courses</li>
  <li>some people have become dependent on technology and on the other hand there are others who are resisting
-so fast that we don’t have time to assess effect
-increasing technology is creating a disparity</li>
</ul>

<p>-information overload not just from technology is part of normal university experience</p>

<p>-high school students who have used WebCT earlier cope better in university
-should we expose them sooner? yes?!?</p>

<p>NLII person:
What if you had access to a Personal knowledge environment (that plugged into collective environment) in high school and then were able to use throughout your life</p>
<ul>
  <li>sounds like a lifeblog to me?</li>
  <li>answer this sounds like a superduper MSN + LiveJournal</li>
  <li>students pick pieces</li>
  <li>not integrated
-MG:doesn’t need to be integrated</li>
</ul>

<p>Dartmouth</p>
<ul>
  <li>still need face to face</li>
  <li>piloting program to do video projects, video, powerpoint
-would you feel comfortable having a student tech tutor and have a lab open in the evenings?
-it works but can get stuck in detail</li>
</ul>

<p>Favourite thing about tech</p>
<ul>
  <li>get in touch from other side of the world</li>
  <li>can teach other students, get charge from getting to figure it out</li>
  <li>students have sense of audience for their writing not just 1 reader, prof</li>
  <li>get to make movies, get to keep in touch when away from school</li>
  <li>access to information you have</li>
  <li>become more efficient student, how to skim</li>
</ul>

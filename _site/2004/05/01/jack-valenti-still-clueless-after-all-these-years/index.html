    <p>(Via <a href="http://randomthoughts.vandorp.ca/syncato/WK/blog/">Darryl VanDorp&#39;</a>s <a href="http://randomthoughts.vandorp.ca/syncato/WK/blog/840_Real_Dialogue.item">randomthoughts</a>)The <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/">freedom to tinker</a>  and lawful fair use is at the heart of why DRM s*cks.  I can&#39;t see how Mr. Valenti can justify the fact that it&#39;s illegal for me to run a program to view a DVD on Linux which I&#39;ve lawfully rented.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V124/N20/ValentiIntervie.20f.html">Real Dialogue: The Tech interviews Jack Valenti </a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>TT: Indeed, but are you doing that when you rent a movie from Blockbuster and you watch it at home? ... I run Linux on my computer. There&#8217;s no product I can buy that&#8217;s licensed to watch [DVDs]. If I go to Blockbuster and rent a movie and watch it, am I a bad person? Is that bad?</p>

<p>JV: No, you&#8217;re not a bad person. But you don&#8217;t have any right.</p>

<p>TT: But I rented the movie. Why should it be illegal?</p>

<p>JV: Well then, you have to get a machine that&#8217;s licensed to show it.</p>

<p>TT: Here&#8217;s one of these machines; it&#8217;s just not licensed.</p>

<p>[Winstein shows Valenti his six-line &#8220;qrpff&#8221; DVD descrambler.]</p>

<p>TT: If you type that in, it&#8217;ll let you watch movies.</p>

<p>JV: You designed this?</p>

<p>TT: Yes.</p>

<p>JV: Un-f*cking-believable.</p>

<p>TT: So the question is, if I just want to watch a movie--I rent it from Blockbuster--is that bad?</p>

<p>JV: No, that&#8217;s not bad.</p>

<p>TT: Then why should it be illegal?</p>

<p>Rich Taylor, MPAA public affairs: It&#8217;s not. ... You could put it in a DVD player, you could play it on any computer licensed for it.</p>

<p>JV: There&#8217;s lots of machines you can play it on.</p>

<p>TT: None under Linux. There&#8217;s no licensed player under Linux.</p>

<p>JV: But you&#8217;re trying to set your own standards.</p>

<p>TT: No, you said four years ago that people under Linux should use one of these licensed players that would be available soon. They&#8217;re still not available -- it&#8217;s been four years.</p>

<p>JV: Well why aren&#8217;t they available? I don&#8217;t know, because I don&#8217;t make Linux machines.</p>

<p>Let me put it in my simple terms. If you take something that doesn&#8217;t belong to you, that&#8217;s wrong. Number two, if you design your own machine, you can&#8217;t fuss at people, because you&#8217;re one of just a few. How many Linux users are there?</p>

<p>TT: About two million.</p>

<p>JV: Well, I can&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s not any -- there must be a reason for... Let me find out about that. You bring up an interesting question -- I don&#8217;t know the answer to that... Well, you&#8217;re telling me a lot of things I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>TT: Okay. Well, how can we have this dialogue?</p>

<p>JV: Well, we&#8217;re having it right now. I want to try to find out the point you make on why are there no Linux licensed players. There must be a reason -- there has to be a reason. I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>[Rich Taylor, a spokesman for the MPAA, later pointed to one company, Intervideo, that has a license to sell GNU/Linux DVD software, although the company does not actually sell a product that Linux users can purchase. Linux users who want to watch DVDs should &#8220;perhaps buy a DVD player instead,&#8221; Taylor said, or &#8220;write to Intervideo and others, encourage them that they&#8217;re the market,&#8221; he said. Will Linux users ever be able to view DVDs on their computers without breaking the law? &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that day is not far away,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Intervideo, Andy Marken, said the company&#8217;s product is only for embedded systems and that Intervideo has no plans to release a software player for end users.]</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p></p>

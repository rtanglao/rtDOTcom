More random thoughts and stream of consciousness ideas from BloggerCon III
</p>
<ul>
<li>I briefly (way too many brief meetings and conversations!) met<a href="http://paulboutin.weblogger.com/"> Paul Boutin</a>, cool journalist from Wired and elsewhere</li>
<li>I briefly chatted with <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/">Steve Gillmor</a>.  Love the <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/gillmorgang.html">Gillmor Gang</a> and I will have my own Podcast soon at dogmaRadio.com.  Until then I will have some <a href="http://www.barbandroland.com/blog/_archives/2004/11/2/173384.html">experimental podcasts</a> at <a href="http://barbandroland.com/">BarbAndroland.com</a> (<a href="http://www.barbandroland.com/blog/index.xml">RSS 2.0 feed with enclosures</a> suitable for <a href="http://ipodder.org/">iPodder</a>).  Must go to Radio Shack and buy a cheap microphone since the microphone on my Powerbook doesn't record any bass! And Steve, I don't know when I will have time to blog here like I did before.  Between the baby and our hosted Drupal startup, <a href="http://bryght.com/">Bryght</a> ("the salesforce.com of dynamic online web communities"), I barely have time to do any blogging at all these days.</li>
<li><a href="http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/">Bob Wyman</a> is cool.  <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> is cool.  Everybody who cares about what people are saying about them or their companies should be using  PubSub to track who links to their website and blogs and to track their keywords (here's a <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com/blog/_archives/2004/4/21/37574.html">HOWTO</a> that I wrote about this).  And they should also be using <a href="http://feedster.com/">Feedster</a> to track their keywords (because sometimes Feedster catches things PubSub doesn't and because Feedster provides a history unlike PubSub which 'searches the future').  I would recommend <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> as well but historically (the last 6 months) every time I have used their service it has NOT worked more often than it has worked. My fingers are cautiously crossed about <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000253.html">Technorati's recent relaunch</a>.  I hope that this fixes the problems that I have noticed.</li>
<li>I briefly chatted with <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/kramer/">Staci Kramer</a> of <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/page_one/index.php">OJR</a> and <a href="http://www.paidcontent.org/">paidContent</a>.  Love t<a href="http://ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1100245630.php">he stuff</a> she is writing and I am glad to see that Rafat is getting some help! Please don't forget to tell journalists that blogs are digital paper and not therefore not just merely diaries but also serious journalism, marketing, etc. tools.</li>
<li>Dan Lyke of <a href="http://flutterby.org/">Flutterby</a> is cool! He's done some cool Python coding to read GPS coordinates from EXIF data.  Hmmm, maybe I can get the Python code that I am help develop on the 7610 to insert GPS data into EXIF data from the 7610.  I will post a follow up post on <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/10/22/my_life_live_on_flickr_courtesy_of_simons_java_midlet_and_my_7610">my 'side project' to get 'minimal click' photo blogging to Flickr on the 7610</a> in both Java and Python.</li>
<li>It was pleasure to once more meet <a href="http://www.downtheavenue.com/">Renee Blodget</a> (met her at BloggerCon I), who's the PR brains behind <a href="http://newsgator.com/">NewGator</a>, <a href="http://www.iupload.com/">iUpload</a> and others.  We probably will use <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/">Darren</a>'s <a href="http://www.capulet.com/">firm</a> for Bryght's PR, but I have a feeling that somehow I will someday end up working with Renee.</li>
<li>I met another Roland, <a href="http://www.hegemonist.com/">Roland Dobbins</a>. Roland you need to blog more and you  need to get <a href="http://cisco.com/">your 'small' networking company</a> :-) to blog!</li>
<li><a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a> is awesome.  Another person who I met at BloggerCon I.  Wow! A force of nature and someone with a lot of knowledge and contacts..</li>
<li>My apologies to <a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000253.html">Aaron</a> and <a href="http://www.identitycommons.net/">the ID Commons people</a> and others who I asked about coffee.  I was desperate since I haven't had much sleep in months and I arrived late so there was no coffee left.  Luckily for everybody else, I found coffee at the nearby bookstore.</li>
<li>There were many more people I met, but I just can't remember and blog everything much as I'd like to and much as I used to!  My apologies to those I have omitted.</li>

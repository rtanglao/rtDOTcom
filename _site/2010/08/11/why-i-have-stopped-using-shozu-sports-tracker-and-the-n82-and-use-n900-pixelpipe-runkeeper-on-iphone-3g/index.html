  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Until I get an N8, I have stopped using ShoZu and Nokia Sports Tracker am using the N900 + PixelPipe + RunKeeper on the iPhone 3G. Why?</p>
<ol><li>None of my friends use Nokia Sports Tracker (On Nokia Sports Tracker, I recorded over 700 activities (90% bicycling, the rest cross country skiing)&nbsp; and many people use it but not one of my friends around the world uses it on a regular basis anymore)</li><li>A fair amount of my friends and people in Vancouver use RunKeeper</li><li>Up until today despite many attempts, Nokia has been unsuccessful in creating a popular social network which is what Nokia Sports Tracker and RunKeeper are. And although I love Nokia Sports Tracker and I'll try it on the N8 in the future, I doubt Sports Tracker now that it's spun off Nokia will be successful! Love to be proven wrong</li><li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/08/11/n900-camera-app-nits">All in all the N900 camera is better than the N82</a> (except for the flash which I don't use)</li><li>I don't have to carry my Bluetooth GPS, the N900 GPS is good enough</li><li>PixelPipe is not nearly as great as ShoZu but it's good enough</li></ol>
<h3>What's wrong with RunKeeper</h3>
<ol><li>On the iPhone 3G, it doesn't multi-task so if I get an alert or phone call, the tracking stops. Hopefully fixed on iPhone 4</li><li>There's no way to lock the touch screen so it's easy to inadvertently stop RunKeeper while you are bicycling. Of course this wasn't an issue with N82 which is an old school candybar phone without touch screen</li></ol>
<h3>PixelPipe observations</h3>
<ol><li>No connectivity re-transmission unlike Shozu. So as I blogged before, if you lose connectivity in the middle of PixelPipe uploading&nbsp; your photos you have to manually figure out which photos were uploaded and upload only the missing ones. This is very painful for a crazy :-) person like me who uploads dozens of photos ; not so painful for the normal person who only uploads 1 or 2 photos per day</li><li>No automatic tagging on a per account basis. In ShoZu you can set it up to tag differently based on which flickr account you upload to</li><li>No multiple accounts unlike ShoZu</li><li>No way to upload friends only or family only i.e. no way to use flickr permissions like ShoZu does only public or private. A pain if you again are a crazy :-) person like me and use flickr permissions&nbsp; like "friends only" or "family only" which I gather less than 1% of flickr users do</li><li>No way to select multiple photos unlike ShoZu. This is a Maemo limitation I guess since there is no system UI gesture to select multiple photos or files. You have to laboriously select one photo at a time until all are selected.</li></ol>

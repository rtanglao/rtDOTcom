  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Shamelessly quoting the entire post from fellow BarCamp Vancouver 2007 organizer, <a href="http://www.telltenfriends.com/blog/2007/08/14/barcampvancouver2007/">Jordan Behan</a>. Go BarCampers go! Present! Lead a session (no experience required, just knowledge and passsion, great way to gel some ideas for sessions at &quot;real&quot; conferences, my argument would be that BarCamp is a lot &quot;realer&quot; than most conferences)! Get your active participation hat on! See you Friday at The Alibi Room and Saturday at 8:30a.m. ish at WorkSpace!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Barcamp Vancouver, the 2007 edition is fast approaching, so get ready to get your Barcamp on. Unless of course you&#8217;re not already signed up, because the pattern is full, Ghost Rider. The pattern is full.</p>

<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007Attendees">This year&#8217;s Vancouver event is already well over-booked</a>, with a waiting list of over 70 people! So this post is more for the folks who are already signed up to attend.</p>

<p>Those of you not in Vancouver are encouraged to search <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007Attendees" >Barcamp.org</a> for your local event, or find details at that same site about how you can organize and host your own. Take a cue from the likes of <a href="http://staticphotography.com/" >Kris</a> <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com" >Krug</a> and <a href="http://www.robertscales.org">Robert Scales</a>, Vancouver&#8217;s own adopted sons, who are teaming up to plan <a href="http://barcampshanghai.org/" >Barcamp Shanghai</a> and <a href="http://barcampbeijing.org/">Barcamp Beijing</a>. Leave it to them to return to the land of the Great Wall with their free-spirited, open-sourcedness to host an unconference in a place where free speech doesn&#8217;t even exist.</p>

<p>Kris also wants to remind folks that he&#8217;ll once again be hosting <a href="http://barcamp.org/PhotoCamp2007">Photocamp</a> at the Vancouver event, so bring yer cameras.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007"/></a></div>

<h3>
What is Barcamp, You Ask?</h3>

<p>For a comprehensive &#8220;What is BarCamp&#8221; lesson, visit <a href="http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp">the BarCamp.org rules page</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">the BarCamp wikipedia entry</a>. In short:</p>

<blockquote><p>BarCamp is an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join.</p>
<p>When you come, be prepared to share with Barcampers.<br />
When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.</p></blockquote>

<p>After last year&#8217;s event, I was so amazed at the things I learned and the people I met that I wanted to help out anywhere I could this year. So I joined (invited myself onto) the organizing committee, and thus I feel it is my duty to share a bit of Barcamp How-to.</p>

<p>So here are some details and a bit of &#8220;what&#8217;s-what&#8221; for the local gang, as stolen from James&#8217; info email that went out this morning:</p>

<h3>A Barcamp Vancouver Hotlist</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you can&#8217;t make it, and you&#8217;re on the list, please give up your spot. Spread the word about this too, there&#8217;s still tons of cool folks waiting to be among the lucky few. If you can&#8217;t come, let somebody know and have yourself replaced on the wiki.</li>
<li>T-shirts are always the hottest topic, and this year will be no exception. They are fuschia in color (I&#8217;m not making this up), and as last year will going for a suggested donation of $20 at the door.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re ready, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/barcamp.org');">go to the wiki</a> and look for the &#8220;Topics&#8221; headline, and share a few words about your presentation. The more you share now, the better chance of being selected on the day, and likely a better turnout as well.</li>

<li>Bring your tools: cameras, laptops, mobile devices and any other cool gadgetry as you deem fit. And while you&#8217;re at it, bring an open mind, and your best ideas. There is always something to be learned, and plenty to be blogged as well.</li>
</ul>

I for one am eagerly looking forward to it. If you happen to bump into me this weekend, please say hello. Whether we&#8217;ve already been acquainted or if we&#8217;ve never had the pleasure of meeting, I&#8217;m always in the mood to say hi and have a conversation. See you then!

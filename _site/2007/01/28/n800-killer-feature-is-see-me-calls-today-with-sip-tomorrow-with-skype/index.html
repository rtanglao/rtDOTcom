  <article class="post-content">
    <p> Please read the very thoughtful N800 review that I&#39;ve quoted below. I can live without  YouTube, really (and I am sure this will be fixed!).  Easy to make video and audio calls with SIP and soon Skype + open Linux make this the closest thing today to  <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2007/01/15">Doc&#39;s ophone</a> (anything with a SIM in it will never be truly open!) concept. I definitely want one of these things! Saving my pennies! When Skype comes out for it, I&#39;ll be seriously tempted to cross over the border into the USA and pick one up! Go Nokia go! </p>
<p> [BTW still want the N95, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/tags/n999">N999</a> and the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/01/13/iphone-and-n999-i-want-both">iPhone</a> :-) Yes I am obsessed or rather I have a compulsive need to create and consume stuff on the go and N95, N999, N800 and the iPhone are (or will be) the best ways to do this!] </p>
<p> FROM <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/2007/01/26/my-review-of-the-nokia-n800-when-the-walkaround-web-meets-the-see-me-anywhere-call/">My review of the Nokia N800 - when the walkaround web meets the see-me-anywhere call at Internet Tablet Talk</a>: </p>
<p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p>
<blockquote> Take it from me, see-me calls are just &hellip; natural. When you don&rsquo;t have to decide up-front, &ldquo;I want to pay extra for this, so it better be worth using,&rdquo; there&rsquo;s an immediate acceptance of &ldquo;this is the way it&rsquo;s meant to be.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that makes people buy a new device, the way Visicalc (the first spreadsheet) made buying one of those new-fangled Apples worthwhile 20-plus years ago. The step-in price is reasonable, the experience is unique and persuasive immediately, and you don&rsquo;t worry that &ldquo;this is going to cost and cost and cost.&rdquo; <br /> <br />You won&rsquo;t hear this described as &ldquo;video conferencing&rdquo; or &ldquo;video calls&rdquo; next year, btw. Those names are so Flash Gordon in their invocation of the future. So don&rsquo;t trust that any reviewer who uses one of those terms has any idea of what&rsquo;s coming. Video conferences are what the guy holding a Treo expects to happen, once Verizon offers it as part of a $120-a-month data plan. <br /> <br />Some users wonder about why the N800 jettisons the useful screen cover that the 770 comes with. It&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re always able to get a call. Putting on the 770&rsquo;s cover doesn&rsquo;t turn off the WiFi (or Bluetooth), but it breaks the wireless connection. Users make it a physical representation of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting my device to sleep.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t put your phone to sleep, and the N800 behaves similarly. <br /> <br />And it makes a world of difference between these tablets and laptops that really do sleep. Your tablet is just on. You start using it. No delay, no wakeup, no nothing. I&rsquo;ve always regarded the 770 as &ldquo;instant on&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s live the moment the screen cover comes down. But the &ldquo;never off&rdquo; side of the N800 is better, and I&rsquo;m more comfortable with keeping it on all day and connected to my network than I have been with the 770. <br /> <br />It&rsquo;s my contention that the opportunity to hook up with voip giant Skype got tied to the webcam, and Ari Virtanen&rsquo;s ascension to the VP of convergent products not only put the internet tablet into the mainstream of Nokia&rsquo;s future thinking (and N-series)**, but also into the CES and consumer electronic marketing timeframes. They weren&rsquo;t going to launch entry number two on some random day in spring like entry one (May 25, to be precise). </blockquote>

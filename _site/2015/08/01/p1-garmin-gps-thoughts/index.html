    <p>the <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/on-the-road/automotive/2014-line/nuvi-2559lmt/prod138335.html">garmin 2599</a> (incomprehensible model numbering scheme) gps has saved us on this trip, some thoughts and observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>it gets confused if you don&#39;t get onto a major road at the beginning and tries to correct with silly single track roads (at least here in Southern France). Solution: look at a paper map and/or google maps and orient yourself at your starting point and use that orientation to make sure you get on the major road at the beginning!</li>
<li>without the gps which we have nicknamed &#39;millifred&#39; for its british accent, we wouldn&#39;t have made it to the very hard to find hotel la garenne in labeaume!</li>
<li>the garmin link feature from the iPhone is great except when bluetooth on the iPhone screws up! then you have to re-pair it with Bluetooth</li>
<li>the dash mount is better than the suction cup but i&#39;m still not sure how it stays mounted since there seems to be a lack of &#39;stickiness&#39;</li>
<li>glad we bought the expensive ($CAN300) &quot;european and north american maps for life&quot; garmin because i wouldn&#39;t have figured out the car gps in my jet lagged state! (and we weren&#39;t supposed to get a car with gps)</li>
<li>my brother said use google maps; judging by the lack of cell phone connectivity here in southern france i don&#39;t think that would have been a great solution (unless i use google maps&#39; kludgey offline support which s*cks in North America let alone France); the garmin gets a gps fix in about 10 seconds and doesn&#39;t need cell phone data and has offline maps. maybe google maps will fix this in a few years but i&#39;m not holding my breath</li>
<li>even though i updated the garmin maps with the june 2015 map update, there are still missing roads and roundabouts (from I guess may 2015 or earlier) but nothing that you can&#39;t figure out. Would be curious to know if google maps gets updated more frequently</li>
<li>the garmin doesn&#39;t say &quot;route recalculation&quot;. instead you have to see it <strong>display</strong> recalculating which is a crazy bug if you ask me!</li>
<li>would i buy the garmin again? yes, it&#39;s imperfect but although we still got lost our getting lost is much less than it would have been if we had relied on google maps or paper maps!</li>

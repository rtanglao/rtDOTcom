<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read the whole thing:<a href="https://www.thatseemsimportant.com/mental-health/headlines-media-panic-pandemic/">Margo Aaron: Coronavirus Is Serious, But Panic Is Optional</a> but if don’t want to :-) here are some great quotes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>“Disconnect Yourself From Outrage Culture”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“<strong>Put effort into your consumption of information.</strong></p>

        <p>Don’t assume the numbers, quotes, or experts are correct. Make our Founding  Fathers’ proud by doing what they meant when they said a republic needs a well-informed citizenry: question authority. Don’t take things at face  value. Ask hard questions. <strong>Make your brain do work.</strong></p>

        <p>I believe, sincerely, that many people behind the crappy headlines are  also afraid. Afraid of losing their jobs or being unable to feed their  kids. Afraid, at the moment, of maybe dying.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.thatseemsimportant.com/psychology/wealth-and-power/">Making money isn’t evil.</a> What’s evil is emotionally exploiting people in order to do it. Which is precisely what these headlines are doing.</p>

        <p><strong>You can fill your brain with information without feeling terror, panic, worry, or fear.</strong>”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>“The media has failed in its responsibilities to the public, but you  don’t have to fail in your responsibilities as a citizen. Do not let  fear hijack your brain.</p>

        <p>Coronavirus is serious, but panic, worry, and terror are optional.</p>

        <p>Choose a better option.”</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

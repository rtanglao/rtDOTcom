  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As I feared the $7 &quot;unlimited&quot; data plan for the recently introduced N95-8GB and other Rogers approved devices restricts you to using the built-in apps. The built-in apps are *ahem* (to be nice) not that great with the exception of the web browser (and I fear that Rogers has somehow neutered the &quot;great for Nokia&quot; webkit based browser but not so great when compared to the iPhone browser). 3rd party apps, like ShoZu and Qik, are much better in my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Not only that, you are forced to commit to a 3 year contract if you wish to use the $7 plan.</p>
<p>At this time, if you are mobile enthusiast, therefore, I can&#39;t recommend the Rogers Unlimited On-Device Mobile Browsing Plan or buying a Rogers N95 8GB. Instead I recommend buying an unlocked N95 8GB from <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3755731&amp;CatId=1809">Tiger Direct</a> or other source and then buying the <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/05/02/drinking-in-the-police-with-nokias-n95/#comment-748407">Rogers 1GB/month $65 &#39;PC Card plan&#39; which Alec Saunders uses with his unlocked non Rogers N95</a>. As far as I know, this plan doesn&#39;t have a 3 year contract requirement. And it doesn&#39;t have the 3rd party app tax (Alec uses 3rd party app Qik to stream video live and doesn&#39;t pay 5 cents per kilobyte).</p>
<p>Anyhow, to end in a positive note, if any Rogers N95-8GB owners want to experiment with 3rd party apps and want to set them up in such a way as to avoid the &quot;5 cents / kilobyte 3rdparty app&quot; r*poff tax, and you are in Vancouver, please email roland AT rolandtanglao.com and let&#39;s get together in Gastown at lunch on a weekday and I&#39;ll show you how (it&#39;s not as intuitive as the iPhone). I&#39;ve been using Nokia S60 smart phones like the N95 for four years and can show you how to use the powerful but not so intuitive S60 interface to your advantage.</p>

Tethering is when you use your phone as a wireless modem to connect to the Internet. The phone can be connected via USB cable or Bluetooth. Once connected, you can access the Internet wirelessly on your laptop using the Rogers Wireless network. While accessing the Internet wirelessly on your computer, data charges are incurred at a rate of 5¢/KB.<br />   What are 3rd party applications?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;3rd party applications are applications like Yahoo! Go or Google Maps. These are non-Rogers applications which may be downloaded to the device and incur data charges at a rate of 5¢/KB.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

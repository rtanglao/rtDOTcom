  <article class="post-content">

  <li>
    <p>Probably mis-read:-)  it but I loved <a href="https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>’s: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50998056-the-ministry-for-the-future">The Ministry for the Future</a>: terrible novel but great ideas so highly recommended :-) I agree that we have enough and giving $USD100,000 to everybody would fix 99% of all our problems. #ymmv But think about it an dread the book before casting the notion aside.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>“A rational response to an intractable problem. But  not really. There was scientifically supported evidence to show that if  the Earth’s available resources were divided up equally among all eight  billion humans, everyone would be fine. They would all be at adequacy,  and the scientific evidence very robustly supported the contention that  people living at adequacy, and confident they would stay there (a  crucial point), were healthier and thus happier than rich people. So the upshot of that equal division would be an improvement for all.</p>

        <p>Rich people would often snort at this last study,  then go off and lose sleep over their bodyguards, tax lawyers, legal  risks — children crazy with arrogance, love not at all fungible —  over-eating and over-indulgence generally, resulting health problems,  ennui and existential angst — in short, an insomniac faceplant into the  realization that science was once again right, that money couldn’t buy  health or love or happiness. Although it has to be added that a reliable sufficiency of money is indeed necessary to scaffold the possibility of those good things. The happy medium, the Goldilocks zone in terms of  personal income, according to sociological analyses, seemed to rest at  around 100,000 US dollars a year, or about the same amount of money that most working scientists made, which was a little suspicious in several  senses, but there it stood: data.</p>

        <p>And one can run the math. The 2,000 Watt Society,  started in 1998 in Switzerland, calculated that if all the energy  consumed by households were divided by the total number of humans alive, each would have the use of about 2,000 watts of power, meaning about 48 kilowatt-hours per day. The society’s members then tried living on that amount of electricity to see what it was like: they found it was fine.  It took paying attention to energy use, but the resulting life was by no means a form of suffering; it was even reported to feel more stylish  and meaningful to those who undertook the experiment.</p>

        <p>So, is there energy enough for all? Yes. Is there  food enough for all? Yes. Is there housing enough for all? There could  be, there is no real problem there. Same for clothing. Is there health  care enough for all? Not yet, but there could be; it’s a matter of  training people and making small technological objects, there is no  planetary constraint on that one. Same with education. So all the  necessities for a good life are abundant enough that everyone alive  could have them. Food, water, shelter, clothing, health care, education.”</p>

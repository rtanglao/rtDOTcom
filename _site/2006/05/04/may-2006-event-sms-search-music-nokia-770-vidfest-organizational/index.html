</p>
<p>
<a href="http://momovan.org/2006/04/mobile-monday-on-a-tuesday/">Mobile Monday Vancouver May 2006</a> last night at <a href="http://take5cafe.com/">Take 5</a> was an eclectic potpourri of topics and very lively conversation. Here are my highlights:
</p>
<p>
Matthew Snyder of Nokia is a  former big wig of Nokia Search but has now moved on to other cool projects in Nokia. His current job is in Helsinki but he's based in Vancouver! Talk about a commute. He was a lively and fascinating conversationalist. Matthew demoed the Nokia/Yahoo Search app on his N70 together with some cool Canadian local integration which has not yet been released but I can't wait until it does. And I hope Matthew will start blogging!
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://jimpick.com/">Jim Pick</a> showed off his 2 (!) Nokia 770s that he picked up when he was living in Berkley. The 770 is an awesome WiFi mini tablet (would be better if Gizmo and Skype were bundled!). I really wish it was sold in Canada. Anyways Jim who recently moved back to Vancouver has worked on the <a href="http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/">ARM port of Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.xensource.com/">Xen Virtualization</a> and the <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> Java virtual machine. Jim's a great addition to the mobile community. Welcome back Jim!
</p>
<p>
Carlo of <a href="http://www.upsidewireless.com/">Upside Wireless</a>  discussed their SMS related work with the <a href="http://www.vancouverbiennale.com/dates.html">Vancouver Sculpture Biennale</a> and plans for the <a href="http://www.ipipi.com//">IPIPI</a> SMS engine
</p>
<p>
Duff Gardner of <a href="http://newmediabc.com/">New Media BC</a>'s <a href="http://mobilemuse.ca/">Mobile Muse</a> project gave us the skinny about the upcoming mobile related talks at <a href="http://vidfest.com/">Vidfest</a> (I wish there was a schedule for Vidfest 2006 that I could link to, but until then here's the <a href="http://www.vidfest.com/index.php?id=67">Vidfest 2006 Speaker list</a>) as well as some insight into the new <a href="http://www.gnwc.ca/Content/GNWC6.aspx">World Centre for Digital Entertainment</a> that New Media BC is working on.
</p>
<p>
Patrick Payne, ex of <a href="http://www.3guploadinc.com/20_million_investment.html">Mobile Operandi/Mophone/3GUPLOAD</a> and Ericsson, was also a lively conversationalist. He spoke about the Wireless lab that will be part of the World Centre and the plans for taking MoMoVan to the next level after learning from the mother ship at the <a href="http://globalsummit.mobilemonday.net/">Mobile Monday Global Summit</a> May 8th and May 9th, 2006 in Helsinki, Finland.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of the MoMo Summit, <a href="http://stephanierieger.com/">Steph Rieger</a> (who along with <a href="http://bryanrieger.com/">Bryan</a> has done 99% of the MoMoVan organizing, I just pontificate and blog :-) !) will be there with Patrick and is also hoping to learn from the MoMo Mothership. She and Bryan also discussed <a href="http://momovan.org/2006/04/april-event-downloads/">Flash Lite</a> as well their ideas for a Bluetooth server.
</p>
<p>
I of course pontificated about the greatness of <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/">ShoZu</a> (my ShoZu <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/shozu">pics</a> and <a href="http://roland.blip.tv/">videos</a>) the <a href="http://n70.bloggercomm.com/">N70 Nokia Blogger Relations program</a> and how I was saving for my own <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/tags/n93">N93 dream phone</a> (3x optical zoom, 30fps video!)
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.litefeeds.com/blojsom/blog/john/">John Goodall</a> of <a href="http://litefeeds.com/">LiteFeeds</a> (a cool mobile RSS reader) made a brief appearance and then mysteriously left (work or family called I bet). Come back John!
</p>
<p>
Finally, we spent a long time discussing the next MoMoVan which will be Monday June 5th at a venue to be determined and what the next phase of MoMoVan looks like. If you are interested in helping shape and influence Mobile Monday Vancouver, it's never too late. Sign up for the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/momovan/?yguid=162879578">Yahoo Grooup MoMoVan group</a> and get your skin in the game! Looking for organizers, speakers, and sponsors! Looking forward to hearing from you!
</p>
<p>
See you in June!

  <article class="post-content">
    <p> The <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n93">Nokia N93</a> (with <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Nokia/N93">crazy transformer form factor,</a> not for normal users definitely!) looks like a perfect phone to run <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/">ShoZu</a>! I want one! This phone basically implements <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/2010-vancouver-olympics-blogging-vision">my 2010 dream phone</a> (3 megapixel, 3x optical zoom) 3 years ahead of schedule . And it does 3G as well as GSM and EDGE so it will work with our cr*ppy Canadian cellphone networks that currently offer GSM and will soon offer EDGE. Question: Is there a CDMA 1X or EVDO phone that&#39;s this compelling? Hmmm I think not! I really don&#39;t understand why CDMA and EV-DO continue to exist other than as a futile, desperate attempt to stem the GSM and UMTS juggernaut. As <a href="http://al3x.net/2006/04/22/keeping-it-first-world">Alex blogged </a>CDMA and EV-DO phones continue to s*ck (mostly clunky and cr*ppy BREW and Windows Mobile phones). </p>
<p> I doubt the <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2006-04-25.22:54">N93 bundled Flickr client</a> is as good as ShoZu. Specifically, I doubt the bundled flickr client has suspend/resume functionality when you lose and regain mobile connectivity. I hope to be proven wrong on this one! Nokia, please bundle ShoZu with future phones! </p>
<p> FROM <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=2320&amp;source=HOMETOP">Review: Nokia N93 (MobileBurn)</a>: </p>
<p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p>
<blockquote> Starting with multimedia capabilities, the new Nokia N93 includes a 3.2 megapixel auto focus camera with Carl Zeiss optics and 3x optical zoom, a 2.4&quot; QVGA display, and full audio/video playback capabilities. The camera is worth noting, not only due to its still image capabilities, but also its ability to capture video in VGA resolution at 30fps - enough for a good experience while utilizing the built in TV-out functionality. As with the other two devices announced from Berlin today, the N93 supports direct uploading to the Flickr photo-sharing site from the handset&#39;s Gallery and Camera applications. Storage-wise, the N93 includes 50MB of on board memory, and miniSD expansion. <br /> <br />On the connectivity front, the 3G capable Nokia N93 again has everything covered. Bluetooth and Infrared support is complemented with the inclusion of 802.11b/g WLAN connectivity, with UPnP for simplified streaming of media to compatible devices. </blockquote>

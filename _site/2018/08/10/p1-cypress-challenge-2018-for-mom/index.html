<ul>
  <li>In 2013, my mother died of pancreatic cancer suddenly in 4 days.</li>
  <li>Pancreatic cancer is deadly and research for a cure underfunded! Therefore, I am riding up Cypress Mountain (12 km) in the <a href="http://www.cypresschallenge.com/">Cypress Challenge for Pancreatic Cancer Research</a> 2018 Sunday August 12, 2018</li>
  <li>Read my story from <a href="http://www.cypresschallenge.com/stories-2018/">Tackling Cypress Mountain in honour of his mother</a>:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>

It’s been five years since he lost her to pancreatic cancer, but Roland Tanglao still has his mother’s spirit vividly engrained in his thoughts.

“She was vivacious, outgoing and loved to travel,” says Roland. “In fact she had just visited for our son’s 9th birthday a month before she passed.”

To honour her memory, the 53-year-old will be taking part in the 11th Annual Glotman•Simpson Cypress Challenge this summer, benefiting the BC Cancer Foundation and pancreatic cancer research at BC Cancer.

Roland, along with hundreds of others, will challenge himself to cycle up Cypress Mountain to help change the outcomes for others facing pancreatic cancer across the province.    

Cancer has hit close to home for him more than once – he also lost his father to liver cancer, his father-in-law to pancreatic cancer, and several friends to the disease.

“You feel helpless and powerless when you see a loved one suffering from cancer,” says Roland. “You can’t help but experience all of those emotions.”

This year, nearly 800 British Columbians will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; 75% of these patients won’t survive the first year, and less than 10% will survive five years.

Since 2008, Cypress Challenge has raised over $2.5 million towards finding solutions and enabling experts at BC Cancer to better understand and treat pancreatic cancer, bringing hope to families across B.C. impacted by the disease.

For Roland, taking on the Cypress Challenge and fundraising is his way of doing his part for the cause. To support Roland's fundraising efforts, visit his personal fundraising page.

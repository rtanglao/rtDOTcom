    <h1>Pontifications</h1>

<ul>
<li>Disclaimer: We don&#39;t eat out as much as we used to before the kid was born 15 years ago :-) which means there are many many restaurants I&#39;ve never heard of or eaten at :-) especially in  Richmond and Burnaby!</li>
<li>I stand by my 2016 recommendations in <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/20/p1-24-hours-in-vancouver/">24 hours in Vancouver what would you recommend?</a> (Rangoli, Revolver, Meat and Bread, New Town (watch out for the Always Be My Maybe groupies :-) ), Patisserie Lebeau, The Boss, Siegel&#39;s Bagels, Phnom Penh, Museum of Vancouver, Beatty Biodiversity Museum, Museum of Anthropology, Strange Fellows microbrew; Aquabus to see Vancouver the water city)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuba.ca/">Nuba</a> is kitty corner from the office. It&#39;s delicious and GF, vegan, meat and family friendly :-) Everything is my favourite. They also have Turkish coffee :-) which I love but #ymmv</li>
<li><a href="https://www.niclipizzeria.com/gastown/">Nicli</a> is 5 or 10 minute walk! Delicious floppy Neapolitan certified pizza. Vegetarian and meat and small (as in 1 or two kids) family friendly :-)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.harukoreankitchen.com/">Haru Korean Kitchen</a> is 3 doors from the office. Super delicious home style Korean; love this place, I could eat there daily! They have delicious-looking vegetarian (I&#39;ve never had it but it sure looks tasty) and they are definitely meat and small family friendly :-). My favourite is their kimchi stew.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nemesis.coffee/">Nemesis</a> has amazing brunch and coffee.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rhinofishnoodlebar.com/">Rhinofish</a> for Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Chinatown. They have other Taiwanese favourites but don&#39;t bother :-) ok bother  because they are delicious but that&#39;s my favourite ! They do have vegan but again never tried it  :-)</li>
<li>Mapo Tofu at <a href="http://www.fatmaonoodles.com/">Fat Mao</a> (I know it&#39;s not &#39;authentic&#39; but if you are open minded when it comes to your mapo tofu you will love it; I&#39;m a <a href="http://vaneats.com/recipes/mains/ma.po.tofu">mapo tofu obsessive</a> and love all the many variations worldwide).  Meat friendly, small restaurant, unfortunately only a few vegetarian options.</li>
<li>Chambar for a more  expensive but awesome Belgian and Moroccan  meal.</li>
<li><a href="http://vancouverurbanwinery.com/">Urban Winery /  Postmark Brewing / Belgard Kitchen</a> for wine and beer and great food</li>
<li>And of course the legendary <a href="http://www.alibi.ca/">Alibi</a> room for beer and food!</li>
<li>A little further: 

<ul>
<li>Kokoro Tokyo <a href="http://menyakokoro.com/menu/">Mazesoba</a> (just get the best seller if you&#39;ve never had &quot;broth less ramen&quot;). They do have vegan! And I bet it&#39;s good</li>
<li>All the Ramen Places, some of my favourites: <a href="http://www.santouka.co.jp/en">Santouka</a>, <a href="https://marutama.ca/">Marutama</a>, <a href="https://ryugetsuservices.wixsite.com/motomachi-shokudo">Motomachi Shokud</a>o, there are sooooo many but they are either on Robson or Denman so 15 minutes or more away from the office</li>
<li><a href="http://kulinarya.ca/vancouver/">Kulinarya on the Drive</a> for Filipino Food (closed Mondays) (skytrain to broadway and commercial; walk 10 minutes north)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kishimotorestaurant.com/">Kishimoto</a> on the drive (closed Monday and Tuesday)</li>
<li><a href="https://guu-izakaya.com/menu/#Original">Guu Original</a> on Thurlow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our wedding night restaurant. Cheap and Cheerful Japanese izakaya (pub food)</li>
<li><a href="https://guu-izakaya.com/location/#Garden">Guu Garden</a> has a nice quiet vibe! and is not as loud as Guu Original.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even further:

<ul>
<li>47 minute walk to <a href="https://anhandchi.com/">Anh and Chi</a> for the best Vietnamese all rounder (chicken Pho is what I order; it&#39;s all good; many veggie and vegan choices) #3 bus will get you there</li>
<li><a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hoi-an-cafe-vancouver">Hoi An</a> is another amazing Vietnamese restaurant! Food from its namesake town which is hard to find.</li>
<li><a href="https://stemjapanese.ca/">Stem Japanese</a> in Burnaby, the suburb to the east! I&#39;ve never been but all my food expert friends love it!</li>
<li>Savio Volpe for Italian in East Vancouver (East Van)</li>
<li>House of Dosas in East Van</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pokongvegetarian.ca/">Po Kon</a>g (not Bo Kong! Make sure it&#39;s &quot;Po Kong&quot; on the south side of the street NOT Bo Kong on the north side of the street) for Vegetarian Dim Sum and dinner! Super delicious and highly recommended.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Richmond:

<ul>
<li>I know nothing about Richmond but they have amazing Chinese food! The only place I know that is great is <a href="https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hk-bbq-master-richmond">HK BBQ master</a>, some of the world&#39;s best Cantonese BBQ. Not veggie friendly. There are many other great Chinese restaurants in Richmond but I never make it there! Ask another person :-) or the internet!</li>
<li>And of course the <a href="https://richmondnightmarket.com/">Richmond night market</a>.</li>
</ul></li>

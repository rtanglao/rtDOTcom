<blockquote>
  <p>As was the case with AIDS, the muted victory now declared that COVID-19 was “won” with a tough mix of behavioral restrictions (less sex for AIDS, fewer crowded events for COVID-19), barriers (condoms/masks), drugs (antiretrovirals/antivirals) and “vaccines.” Dutch doctor Joep Lange famously declared some 20 years ago that anti-HIV drugs so effectively blocked transmission of the virus that treatment is prevention. Out of the limelight, in meetings with HIV research colleagues, Lange argued that the drugs, taken as prophylactics—dubbed PrEP—by sexually active individuals, were “vaccines,” as the medicines prevented most lasting infections.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And in practice, PrEP is now widely used to prevent HIV infection. But the drugs aren’t genuine vaccines, akin to measles immunization, for example, as they can’t be administered and boosted to provide lifelong protection against infection. Thus, the financial spigot must flow in perpetuity, and sexually active adults who fear their partners carry HIV, and drug users that share syringes, must take their PrEP assiduously and frequently.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no AIDS cure, despite a handful of isolated cases of individuals treated with heroic measures to effectively clear HIV from their bodies. And there is no HIV vaccine.
We have followed the same path with COVID-19. The mRNA “vaccines” used by billions of people do not block COVID-19 infection or prevent the vaccinated individual from passing the virus on to others. Moreover, vaccine efficacy in preventing acute COVID-19 disease and death wanes within months, as the viral evolution process appears today to be primarily a natural selection phenomenon aimed at evading host immune systems. (Natural infection also provides very short-lived protection against future reinfections and severe disease.)</p>

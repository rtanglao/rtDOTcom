  <article class="post-content">
    <p>May 15, 2009 was my last day of work for Raincity Studios and with it of course my involvement with Bryght ended as well. It's been a great ride! Thanks to all the Bryght Gals, Guys, customers, investors, friends and of course the folks at Raincity Studios. I am certain that the "Bryght Children" will in their own way (in a small "Fairchild children" way, haha!)&nbsp; continue to make their mark&nbsp; (e.g. <a href="http://rilli.com/">Rilli</a>, <a href="http://bootuplabs.com/">Bootup Labs</a>, and I predict many many more). My next post will be about my new job but for now a few random thoughts and reflections (apologies to the great people I have omitted!):</p>
<ul><li>I'll never forget moving day into the first Bryght offices at 525 Seymour with the folks at EQO (also gone).</li><li>Bryght Light developed by Adrian and the rest of the Bryght team was and is a Drupal milestone. I can't to see what the fine folks at Lullabot and Acquia&nbsp; and WorkHabit and the other fine folks doing Drupal hosting come up with. Not to mention what happens with Development Seed, Adrian and&nbsp; the other folks developing Aegir. Aegir definitely ups the proverbial Drupal hosting 'ante'.</li><li>Speaking of WorkHabit, I will always be impressed by their VPS hosting partnership with Bryght. As far as I know Bryght VPS was the only Drupal-centric VPS hosting from a Canadian company, one of the few in the world and probably the first. Nobody did it better. Thanks to Richard, Gary of WorkHabit, incredible system engineers and sysadmins: Narayan Newton and Ben Holt. Learned some great lessons:i.e. always iterate, automate and listen to the market!</li></ul>
<p>Herewith some random Bryght photos to end it off in a visual style! Ciao Tschüß!</p>

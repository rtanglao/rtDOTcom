    <p>It's hard to believe how time flies, but the <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/">5th Northern Voice</a> (for the 5th time I am one of the organizers) starts tomorrow with the <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/blog/kick-dinner-party-fredericos-supper-club">Federico's dining and dancing opening party</a>,(<a href="http://diydharma.org/about-us">Scott Nelson</a> with a bit of assistance from myself are providing the WiFi, thanks Scott!), <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/friday">Friday</a> begins the conference proper with a fab social media 101 track organized by <a href="http://www.bailie.com/">Rahel Anne Bailie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/anitawebster">Anita Webster</a>, a <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp-mobile">fantastic mobile track</a>, the <a href="http://northernvoice.pbwiki.com/MooseCamp+2009">MooseCamp</a> unconference and a <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/stewart-butterfield">Stewart Butterfield keynote</a> and <a href="http://2009.northernvoice.ca/">Saturday</a> is the more traditional conference day.</p>
<p>So, I don't really have the time but since I love Mozilla, here's one of my Mossecamp ideas for Friday (if you like it, see you on Friday assuming it's accepted!):</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;">In a nutshell</span>:</h2>
<ol><li>10 people will signup up to have Roland tape 1-12 second videos of them live (i.e. no editing) on "One way the internet has changed their life."</li><li>Roland will post them to flickr with a Creative Commons Attribution License to the Mozilla Net Effects Flickr Group</li><li>The people in the session will watch them and vote on the "best" one (majority rules, my "best" definition: bonus points for fun, other languages, cool things but of course your definition is up to you!)</li><li>Winner gets a prize. Prize will be a free 1:30 second video taped by Roland on his Nokia N82 on Friday at Moosecamp and edited on iMovie by Roland and submitted to flickr and possibly some Mozilla swag from Zak</li></ol>
<h2>More background from Zak:</h2>
<ol><li>flickr group - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mozillanetfx/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/mozillanetfx/</a></li><li>Mozilla Net Effects page - <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation/Program/Net_Effects">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation/Program/Net_Effects</a></li><li>Zak's blog post: explaining why videos and the idea behind this! - <a href="http://zak.greant.com/what-does-the-net-mean-to-you">http://zak.greant.com/what-does-the-net-mean-to-you</a></li></ol>
<h2>Disclaimers and other Blah Blah</h2>
<ol><li>Zak is an employee of the Mozilla Foundation</li><li>Roland is Zak's friend, doesn't work for Mozilla but loves Firefox</li></ol>

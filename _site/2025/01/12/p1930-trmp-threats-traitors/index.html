<h2 id="quote">QUOTE</h2>

<p>Read the whole thing: <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/01/10/opinion/trump-threats-traitors">Max Fawcett:: Trʊmp’s threats expose the tr🄐itors in our midst ¦ Canada’s National Observer: Climate News</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why are so many C🄐nadian C🄞nservatives welcoming, or at least entertaining, Trʊmp’s advances? Because Jʊstin Trʊdeau made them do it, apparently. His now infamous remark about how “there is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada” to fellow Canadian Guy Lawson in a 2015 New York Times magazine  profile, one that spoke to his father’s vision for our national culture and its unique ability to embrace difference and diversity, has somehow become an invitation to disloyalty and cowardice. Never mind that it was an attempt to articulate a more inclusive view of our national identity, one that clearly set us apart from America. For many C🄞nservatives in Canada, Trʊdeau’s belief in a “p🄞stn🄐tional” future was all the excuse they ever needed to betray their own country.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is by far the most pitiful example yet of Trʊdeau-derangement syndrome, and that’s a category with plenty of strong contenders. I assure you that there is nothing any future government could say or do that would weaken my commitment to this country and its future. My loyalty and patriotism aren’t a function of who’s in power at the moment, and they certainly aren’t about to be overridden by petty partisanship, much less a misunderstood, decade-old quote in the New York Times. If only the folks who had spent so much time and energy over the last few years publicly professing their supposed love for this country felt the same.</p>

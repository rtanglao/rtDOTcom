<h3 id="pink-pasta---fettuccine-with-beet-smoked-salmon-and-feta">Pink Pasta - Fettuccine with Beet, Smoked Salmon, and Feta</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>½ lb (225gms) uncooked fettuccine noodles, gluten-free or regular
    1 medium beet (~2½/6.5cm diameter) (1 packed cup when shredded)
    ½ medium onion
    2 tablespoons butter
    ¼ teaspoon salt
    ¼ teaspoon pepper
    1 cup chicken broth
    ¼ cup dry white vermouth or dry white wine
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    3.5 oz (100gms) smoked salmon slices (about ½ cup, packed)
    1 tablespoon capers
    ½ cup (60gms) crumbled feta cheese, plus a bit extra for garnish
    chopped fresh dill or parsley for serving - optional</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. (I use 1 teaspoon salt.) When it boils, add the fettuccine and cook for one minute less than the package recommends.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the water is boiling and the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peel the beet with a vegetable peeler, leaving the stem intact for a handhold while grating it. Shred the beet on the large holes of a cheese grater. Dice the onion.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the shredded beet, diced onion, salt, and pepper, and cook until the beets are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add the chicken broth and the vermouth or wine. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the cream and keep warm until the pasta is finished cooking.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reserve a few thin slices of smoked salmon to garnish the finished pasta, chop the rest into large chunks.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the pasta is one minute short of being al dente (you still want it to have a good firmness to it), drain it and add it to the beets. Toss to coat the pasta strands and cook for one minute. Remove from the heat and add the smoked salmon, capers, and ½ cup of feta cheese.  Toss gently to distribute everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Serve immediately, garnished with the reserved smoked salmon strips, feta crumbles, and chopped dill or parsley.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Serves 2 as a main course, or 4 as a first course.</p>

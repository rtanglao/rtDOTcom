&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated this principle in an automation system called Buttons. To start out, users could move buttons around and change the text or color. Slightly further up the slope, users could edit variable values or use a toolkit to create simple UIs. Finally, at the top of the slope, users could create new behaviors by doing Lisp programming. The key point was that each customization could be done with the simplest technique possible, leaving full programming only as a last resort when absolutely needed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Jun 6, 2025 16:06 &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/profile/11031131-charles-marohn/note/c-122635942&quot;&gt;Charles Marohn of Strong Towns on fixing North America’s broken zoning:: So let me be clear: when I say we want to “make better decisions inevitable over time,” I don’t mean inevitable like gravity. I mean inevitable like compound interest—tiny, persistent, visible pressure applied in the same direction until the math changes. It’s slow, messy, and often invisible at first.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/profile/11031131-charles-marohn/note/c-122635942&quot;&gt;Charles Marohn of Strong Towns on fixing North America’s broken zoning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is why the Strong Towns approach matters even more in places like yours, where the problem isn’t preemption from above, but institutional entropy from within.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what breaks the cycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a single lever. But here are a few that I think work together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrative dominance&lt;/strong&gt;. Most communities have no alternative story about why the current system fails. Our job is to provide that story, clearly, repeatedly, and with examples that show what’s possible. When councilmembers start hearing the same questions from multiple directions—“Why are we blocking gentle density that aligns with our values?”—they start to feel the pressure shift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create visible wins&lt;/strong&gt;. If the system won’t legalize ADUs by right across the board, help one homeowner do it as a pilot. Or find one that is grandfathered in and working well. Document everything. Turn the story into a column, a workshop, a visual. Sometimes the clearest path is to de-risk the unfamiliar by showing that it’s already working, quietly. The housing toolkit I shared with you is full or boringly normal people doing these things we want to ultimately seem boringly normal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic allyship inside the bureaucracy.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t need your entire staff to champion reform, just one or two mid-level staffers willing to help shape internal proposals, provide cost estimates, or identify the least risky way to get started. Celebrate their efforts publicly to protect them institutionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback loops that don’t require council&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider embedding reforms inside budget decisions, infrastructure maintenance plans, or administrative manuals. If you can’t change zoning directly, can you change how capital improvements prioritize walkable areas? Can you bake small wins into how staff scopes repairs?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure from organized outsiders.&lt;/strong&gt; Not state preemption, but organized citizen campaigns. If your commissioners and staff are stuck, outside groups (like a Strong Towns Local Conversation) can bring energy and legitimacy to the push. Don’t make it a demand for radical change; make it a call to implement the next smallest step.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>ME:: Bad for the environment yet good for already privileged experts who have time and energy to experiment seems to be the common thread of this ever evolving ML world ; Thomas Ptacek:: My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts · The Fly Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Jun 5, 2025 18:09  &lt;a href=&quot;https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/&quot;&gt;ME:: Bad for the environment yet good for already privileged experts who have time and energy to experiment seems to be the common thread of this ever evolving ML world ; Thomas Ptacek:: My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts · The Fly Blog&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– ROFL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Call any of this out if you want to watch a TED talk about how hard it is to stream The Expanse on LibreWolf. Yeah, we get it. You don’t believe in IPR. Then shut the fuck up about IPR. Reap the whirlwind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s all special pleading anyways. LLMs digest code further than you do. If you don’t believe a typeface designer can stake a moral claim on the terminals and counters of a letterform, you sure as hell can’t be possessive about a red-black tree. … When I started writing a couple days ago, I wrote a section to “level set” to the state of the art of LLM-assisted programming. A bluefish filet has a longer shelf life than an LLM take. In the time it took you to read this, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Kids today don’t just use agents; they use asynchronous agents. They wake up, free-associate 13 different things for their LLMs to work on, make coffee, fill out a TPS report, drive to the Mars Cheese Castle, and then check their notifications. They’ve got 13 PRs to review. Three get tossed and re-prompted. Five of them get the same feedback a junior dev gets. And five get merged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>ME: stories have their time and place, sometimes people just want to hear the facts first ; Eliot Peper:: How to Become a Better Conversationalist</title>

Skipping straight to the punch line ruins the joke, and morals don’t stick without parables. Wrapping your idea in narrative enables others to engage with it more deeply, understand it more fully, and remember it later. So instead of diving into a direct explanation, tell a story that embodies the truth you want to communicate. Like enthusiasm, storytelling is contagious, and soon you’ll be trading insight-laden tales. ... Conversely, when you ask a question, rather than seeking an explicit answer, challenge yourself to use the question as a prompt to elicit the most interesting possible response from your interlocutor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

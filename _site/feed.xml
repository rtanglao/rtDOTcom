The best way to help them out is to attack the ideas and emotions that make The Convicted Criminal worship appealing. Attacking their belief in the leader himself is ineffective, because submitting to The Convicted Criminal has become part of their very self-concept.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME: tl;dr-ing Stock firmware works (Unlike Rui, I have no need for low-level control) and so does OpenWRT. Something to consider in 2027 or something but by then there will be something shinier :-)  LOL! ; Rui:: The Cudy AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 System (with OpenWRT) - Tao of Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Sep 26, 2025 06:52 (UTC)&lt;a href=&quot;https://taoofmac.com/space/reviews/2025/09/14/1630&quot;&gt;ME: tl;dr-ing Stock firmware works (Unlike Rui, I have no need for low-level control) and so does OpenWRT. Something to consider in 2027 or something but by then there will be something shinier :-)  LOL! ; Rui:: The Cudy AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 System (with OpenWRT) - Tao of Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Cudy AX3000/M3000 models make for pretty great Airport Extreme replacements, and in this age of networking devices with cloud features nobody asked for OpenWRT turns them into very nice locally managed access points that I will never have to worry about again (until I break the configuration myself, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although it is much too early to weigh in on hardware reliability (some of the 802.11ac Airport Extremes I was using were manufactured over a decade ago), the price/performance ratio is great, and right now I don’t mind it not being Wi-Fi 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After all, it took almost ten years for the 2.4GHz band to become saturated in my building, and it doesn’t look as if the 5GHz band is going to be massively swamped anytime soon, so I’m expecting something like 3-4 years of hassle-free operation if the hardware holds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A relevant thing I should point out again is that people who have less need for low-level control might actually be fine with the stock firmware—I did not use it extensively (nor did I try the Cudy app or any of the router/firewall features), but it already exposes a lot more functionality (and seems a lot more flexible) than ISP gear, so I would encourage people to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/09/24/tdd-under-the-microscope-1-usage-driven-design/&quot;&gt;Jason Gorman:: TDD Under The Microscope #1 – Usage-Driven Design – Codemanship’s Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A more flexible and robust way to describe workflow is to imply ordering of events declaratively*. Instead of “Boil the kettle, then pour the water into the teapot”, we might say “When the water is poured into the teapot, it must be at near boiling”. Now all of our edge cases work. We could have boiled it in a pan. We could have boiled it in a microwave. We could have watched the squirrel and then boiled the kettle again. Workflow is implied: the water has been boiled, but we leave ourselves many more routes to pouring it in the teapot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A similar approach can be taken with workflows like TDD; instead of “Run the test to see it fail, then write the simplest code to pass it”, we could say “When we write the code to pass the test, it must be failing”. It’s a subtle but important distinction, and one which I’ve realised I’ve been using for a long time when I observe developers working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/space-invaders/&quot;&gt;Simon Willison:: My 2.5 year old laptop can write Space Invaders in JavaScript now, using GLM-4.5 Air and MLX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My 2.5 year old laptop can write Space Invaders in JavaScript now, using GLM-4.5 Air and MLX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wrote about the new GLM-4.5 model family yesterday—new open weight (MIT licensed) models from Z.ai in China which their benchmarks claim score highly in coding even against models such as Claude Sonnet 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The models are pretty big—the smaller GLM-4.5 Air model is still 106 billion total parameters, which is 205.78GB on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ivan Fioravanti built this 44GB 3bit quantized version for MLX, specifically sized so people with 64GB machines could have a chance of running it. I tried it out… and it works extremely well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I fed it the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Write an HTML and JavaScript page implementing space invaders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And it churned away for a while and produced the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Clearly this isn’t a particularly novel example, but I still think it’s noteworthy that a model running on my 2.5 year old laptop (a 64GB MacBook Pro M2) is able to produce code like this—especially code that worked first time with no further edits needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This tragedy of dark patterns then neatly cascaded into a catastrophic comedy of bugs, where a full root drive apparently corrupts online Microsoft accounts on Windows 11 so hard they become essentially unrecoverable. There were no warnings and no informational popups. Ominous user accounts started to appear on the login screen. Weird suggestions to use corporate-looking security USB keys pop up. Windows wrongfully tells my wife the PIN code and password she enters are incorrect. The suggestion to change the password or PIN code breaks completely. All the well-known rescue options any average user would turn to in WinRE throw up cryptic errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When I wrote about how good ChatGPT with GPT-5 is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google’s efforts around this are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m glad I left that out, because it turns out Google’s new “AI mode” is genuinely really good! It feels very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To those of us in public health, it feels like the world is on fire. We’re watching the systematic dismantling of institutions that have protected Americans from disease for decades. But to most people? They have no idea any of this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The damage isn’t just rhetorical. In six months under Kennedy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The CDC has lost nearly half its budget and thousands of employees.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;He fired all vaccine advisory experts, replacing them with vaccine skeptics.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple CDC leaders have resigned in protest.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The agency is described as broken by former directors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Important programs targeting cancer, heart disease, strokes, lead poisoning, injury prevention, and violence have been severely weakened or defunded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The largest measles outbreak in a generation occurred during this period, while Kennedy downplayed the importance of vaccines and promoted unproven treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Funding for global vaccination efforts protecting millions of children worldwide has been halted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Jim O’Neill, a non-medically trained investment adviser, was appointed as acting CDC director, raising concerns about leadership expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A gunman attacked CDC staff, motivated by Covid vaccine opposition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The agency’s focus was narrowed to infectious diseases only, abandoning key chronic disease and injury prevention roles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

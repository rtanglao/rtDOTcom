Here’s what happened :: How to talk to strangers at a bar about Covid, dispel misinformation and explain the real science behind vaccines and mRNA vaccines ¦ STAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing of course: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/06/covid-misinformation-bar-strangers-public-health-science/&quot;&gt;Jess Steier:: I inserted myself into a conversation at a bar about Covid and vaccines. Here’s what happened :: How to talk to strangers at a bar about Covid, dispel misinformation and explain the real science behind vaccines and mRNA vaccines ¦ STAT&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To those of us in public health, it feels like the world is on fire. We’re watching the systematic dismantling of institutions that have protected Americans from disease for decades. But to most people? They have no idea any of this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The damage isn’t just rhetorical. In six months under Kennedy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The CDC has lost nearly half its budget and thousands of employees.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;He fired all vaccine advisory experts, replacing them with vaccine skeptics.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Multiple CDC leaders have resigned in protest.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The agency is described as broken by former directors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Important programs targeting cancer, heart disease, strokes, lead poisoning, injury prevention, and violence have been severely weakened or defunded.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The largest measles outbreak in a generation occurred during this period, while Kennedy downplayed the importance of vaccines and promoted unproven treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Funding for global vaccination efforts protecting millions of children worldwide has been halted.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Jim O’Neill, a non-medically trained investment adviser, was appointed as acting CDC director, raising concerns about leadership expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;A gunman attacked CDC staff, motivated by Covid vaccine opposition.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The agency’s focus was narrowed to infectious diseases only, abandoning key chronic disease and injury prevention roles.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Writing out these bullet points feels futile because it is difficult to convey the magnitude of destruction. This is demolition, not reform. And it’s happening while the public thinks Kennedy is fighting for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Sep 6, 2025 21:35 (UTC)&lt;a href=&quot;https://dora.dev/guides/how-to-innovate-with-generative-ai/&quot;&gt;ME:: seems like platitudes :-)  to baseline, experiment, have a community of practice and read DORA and other’s research papers?!?!? ; Amanda Lewis:: August 2024:: DORA:: How to enable your software delivery teams to innovate with generative AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing and what’s linked: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dora.dev/guides/how-to-innovate-with-generative-ai/&quot;&gt;Amanda Lewis:: August 2024:: DORA ¦ How to enable your software delivery teams to innovate with generative AI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To innovate your software delivery and operations with generative AI, a culture of continuous improvement and user-centricity is essential. Begin by establishing a baseline, nurture curiosity and experimentation, and cultivate a collaborative community of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Set a baseline: it’s always good to know where you are before you start introducing new practices and capabilities. Be sure you know the software delivery performance of your team so that you can see how introducing generative AI affects your development and delivery processes. The DORA Quick Check is a great place to start your baselining efforts, and you can bookmark your results for easy reference.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Encourage curiosity and experimentation: the early findings show that generative AI can improve well-being. Remember the importance of having a generative and learning culture when you introduce generative AI into your organization. Foster a space where your teams can see this technology as an opportunity for experimenting and innovating, and not as a threat.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Establish a generative AI community of practice: high-performing teams prioritize strategies that foster a sense of community across various organizational levels. These strategies include establishing communities of practice and supporting proofs of concept. As your organization experiments with generative AI, encourage collaboration based on best practices, knowledge sharing, and learning from failures.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Read our most recent research: DORA continues to research an publish findings about adoption, attitudes, and downstream impacts of AI.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Join the DORA Community of Practice: share your experience with fellow travelers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why AI Coding Claims Don’t Add Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And yet, despite the most widespread adoption one could imagine5, these tools don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My argument: If so many developers are so extraordinarily productive using these tools, where is the flood of shovelware? We should be seeing apps of all shapes and sizes, video games, new websites, mobile apps, software-as-a-service apps — we should be drowning in choice. We should be in the middle of an indie software revolution. We should be seeing 10,000 Tetris clones on Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s not exactly a fully self-hosted solution since you’re relying on a company’s servers, Tailscale simplifies the process of exposing your local services to external networks. So, here’s a quick guide on how you can configure Tailscale to remotely access your favorite self-hosted services.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: Not tested on Humans yet but sounds promising go science go; September 2024:: Brigham and Women’s Hospital. PCANS Drug-free nasal spray blocks, neutralizes viruses, bacteria — Harvard Gazette</title>

PCANS Drug-free nasal spray blocks, neutralizes viruses, bacteria — Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;via &lt;a href=&quot;https://sfba.social/@nwchapman/115124195881987830&quot;&gt;@nwchapman’s toot&lt;/a&gt; and also there’s a an earlier drug free nasal spray using Iota-Carrageenan: see October 2021:: &lt;a href=&quot;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493111/&quot;&gt;Efficacy of a Nasal Spray Containing Iota-Carrageenan in the Postexposure Prophylaxis of COVID-19 in Hospital Personnel Dedicated to Patients Care with COVID-19 Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/drug-free-nasal-spray-blocks-neutralizes-viruses-bacteria/&quot;&gt;PCANS Drug-free nasal spray blocks, neutralizes viruses, bacteria — Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Experiments in mice showed that a single dose of the PCANS nasal spray could effectively block infection from an influenza virus (PR8) at 25 times the lethal dose. Virus levels in the lungs were reduced by &amp;gt;99.99 percent, and the inflammatory cells and cytokines in the lungs of PCANS-treated animals were normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The formulation’s ability to inactivate a broad spectrum of pathogens, including the deadly PR8 influenza virus, demonstrates its high effectiveness,” said co-senior author Yohannes Tesfaigzi, AstraZeneca Professor of Medicine in the Field of Respiratory and Inflammatory Diseases at BWH. “In a rigorous mouse model study, prophylactic treatment with PCANS demonstrated exceptional efficacy, with treated mice exhibiting complete protection, while the untreated group showed no such benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the study’s limitations include the lack of human studies of PCANS, it provides a strong foundation for future research to explore the full potential of PCANS in a broader context. The researchers are exploring whether PCANS can also block allergens, opening a potential new avenue for allergy relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the time, atproto relays required a cache of the full network on local disk to validate data structures. With the Sync v1.1 updates, relays don't need all that disk I/O. What impact does that have on hosting setup and operating costs ... Turns out the dev community beat me to the punch and folks like @futur.blue and @bad-example have been doing this for months on Rapsberry Pis and $19/month VPS servers in European jurisdiction. ... But i'm still really psyched at how much simpler things have become, so I set up my own $34/month VPS demo instance, and this is the write-up. ...The relay describe here is running at: https://relay-vps.demo.bsky.dev&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;– See also Rudy Fraser’s YouTube interview: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Uvj1h7OQPkk?si=OflEMDblOYTZOu1w&quot;&gt;Blacksky Algorithms: Building Decentralized Social Media with Rudy Fraser&lt;/a&gt; and of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://blacksky.community/&quot;&gt;Blacksky.community&lt;/a&gt; which is up and running and doing great AFAICT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mathematics-of-impossible-things&quot;&gt;Mathematics of Impossible Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/alchemy-2-electric-boogaloo-django-beatty-luqbc/&quot;&gt;Django Beatty:: Alchemy 2: Electric Boogaloo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Scientists recently mapped one cubic millimeter of human brain tissue - a piece the size of a grain of sand. It took 1.4 petabytes of data. Not to simulate it. Not to model it. Just to store a static 3D photograph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One grain of sand worth of brain tissue. Frozen. Dead. Not even trying to capture how it works - just what it looks like. And it takes more data than Netflix uses to stream to a small country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Inside that grain? 57,000 cells. 150 million synapses. Each synapse is a chemical factory with over 1,000 different proteins. Each protein changes shape and function based on what’s happening around it. And that’s just the photograph. The frozen moment. To model how it actually works? We don’t even know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is where the dream of artificial general intelligence hits a wall that nobody talks about. Years ago, I was discussing AGI with my friend Dr. Roman Belavkin - a researcher in cognitive science at Middlesex University. Over coffee, he explained the problems with modeling biological neurons that should be headline news but instead stay buried in academic conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I needed to understand: were these problems speed bumps or brick walls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The more Roman explained, the clearer it became to me. These aren’t speed bumps. They’re mathematical voids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem starts with backpropagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let me explain what that means, because it’s the heart of why AGI is impossible with current mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most deep learning systems today - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - rely on an algorithm called backpropagation. Think of it like teaching a child: you show them a picture of a cat, they guess “dog,” you tell them how wrong they were, and they adjust their mental model. Do this millions of times and they learn to recognize cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-1943-problem&quot;&gt;The 1943 Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why don’t we just model real neurons? While we can model neurons at many fidelities - the best are still cartoon sketches. The original McCulloch-Pitts model from 1943 used simple on/off switches with step functions - not differentiable, couldn’t work with backpropagation (which hadn’t been invented yet). In the 1980s, to make backpropagation work, we replaced the step functions with smooth curves. But we’re still using the same basic framework: weighted sums, linear algebra, one-dimensional signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we tried to model biological detail - the neurotransmitters, the dendritic processing, the living cellular machinery - we don’t even have the mathematics to describe it, let alone compute it. A single biological neuron isn’t a switch - it’s a living cell, a chemical factory floating in a soup of neurotransmitters, hormones, and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a signal arrives at a neuron, it doesn’t just flow through like electricity through a wire. The signal arrives at branches called dendrites, and here’s where everything breaks: each branch does its own processing. Not simple addition or multiplication - complex, unpredictable transformations that we struggle to describe mathematically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re trying to predict the flow of a river. But this river has thousands of tributaries, and each tributary follows its own rules - some flow uphill, some disappear underground and reappear elsewhere, some spontaneously change direction based on the phase of the moon. Now try to write an equation for where a drop of water will end up. That’s what we’re trying to do with neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 20, 2025 15:59 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/OILbI#selection-949.0-953.408&quot;&gt;ME:: the bible is not anti-poor, anti-abortion, anti gay rights and anti-immigrant. Read it completely ‘Christians’! ; Nicholas Kristof:: What Would Surprise Jesus About Christmas 2025? - The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I do too. So many people who claim to follow Jesus appear to have no idea what he actually taught. When I was an evangelical, we thought it was important to know what the Bible said and act on it. But today the evangelical movement focuses largely on social agendas not promoted in the Bible while ignoring ethical injunctions the Bible makes repeatedly. Whatever one’s views of abortion today, it is simply wrong to say the Bible opposes it. The Bible never mentions a deliberate attempt to abort a fetus, and the only biblical passages that relate to the question of whether a fetus is to be treated as a living person with human rights indicate the answer is no (e.g., Exodus 21:22-25). What the Bible does stress, page after page, is the need to care for the poor, the outcast, the “other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So too with gay rights: People regularly quote Leviticus about how it’s a sin for a man to sleep with a man (Leviticus 18:22). But they then ignore the very next chapter, which explicitly insists that immigrants to your country are to be treated just the same as citizens (Leviticus 19:33-34). Why do people focus on one verse instead of the other? They simply pick what they find useful for their own views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is wrong to be on a platform that openly allows hate speech. If the Nazi Party’s newspaper paid you $USD1000 / month in 1939 to write an op-ed monthly would you do it? No. https://om.co/2025/08/03/the-why-of-substack/ is wrong. sorry not sorry Om et al!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>ME:: tl;dr-ing: pick from or edit LLM generated regexes or add your own and see relevant examples in VSCode, seems like a practical and safe use of LLMs;  Siddhartha Prasad:: LLMs ⭢ Regular Expressions, Responsibly!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 17, 2025 17:51 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.brownplt.org/2025/12/11/pick-regex.html&quot;&gt;ME:: tl;dr-ing: pick from or edit LLM generated regexes or add your own and see relevant examples in VSCode, seems like a practical and safe use of LLMs;  Siddhartha Prasad:: LLMs ⭢ Regular Expressions, Responsibly!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.brownplt.org/2025/12/11/pick-regex.html&quot;&gt;Siddhartha Prasad:: LLMs ⭢ Regular Expressions, Responsibly!&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But we can do a lot better! Our new tool, PICK:Regex, does the following. It asks you for a prompt and sends it to a GenAI system. However, it doesn’t ask for one regex; instead, it uses an LLMs ability to interpret prose in multiple ways to generate multiple (about four) candidate expressions. (The details don’t matter, but if you want to you can open the images below in a new tab to read them more easily.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In theory, that’s better than getting just one interpretation. But now you may have to read four regexes like the above, which is actually worse! Therefore, instead, PICK shows you concrete examples. Furthermore, the examples are carefully chosen to tell apart the regexes. You are then asked to upvote/downvote each example. As you do, you are actually voting on all the candidate regexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can stop at any point (you’re always shown the regexes), but the process naturally halts when only one regex remains (this is your best candidate of the ones you’ve seen so far) or none remain (in which case it would have been dangerous to use the LLMs output!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 16, 2025 03:20 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/tssm/thoughts/src/branch/canon/on-using-language-models-for-programming.md&quot;&gt;ME:: automation makes the bits left over humans more challenging; See also Lisanne Bainbridge’s paper: Ironies of Automation from 1983; Tae Selene Sandoval Murgan:: thoughts/on-using-language-models-for-programming.md &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeberg.org/tssm/thoughts/src/branch/canon/on-using-language-models-for-programming.md&quot;&gt;Tae Selene Sandoval Murgan:: thoughts/on-using-language-models-for-programming.md at canon - tssm/thoughts - Codeberg.org&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;lt;– See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://ckrybus.com/static/papers/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf&quot;&gt;Lisanne Bainbridge’s classic 1983 paper in Automatic: Ironies of Automation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I wrote a version of the above as a Mastodon thread. And then I read Ironies of automation by Lisanne Bainbridge, a paper that, quoting its abstract, “discusses the ways in which automation of industrial processes may expand rather than eliminate problems with the human operator”. I got several ideas from it, but the most important is that regardless of how automation is performed, whatever levels of “intelligence” an automated system has, it’s rarely designed to collaborate with the human that formerly performed the work. On the contrary it’s designed to replace them. Which is an irony (as defined in the paper) because (among others) “by taking away the easy parts of his task, automation can make the difficult parts of the human operator’s task more difficult.” Even more, automation seldom “consider the integration of man and computer, nor how to maintain the effectiveness of the human operator by supporting his skills and motivation. There will always be a substantial human involvement with automated systems, because criteria other than efficiency are involved”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We know language models have been touted as tools that enable computers to replace humans intellectual labor. And here we have a 40 years old paper saying actually that has never worked. I don’t believe language models or any other form of artificial “intelligence” is here to stay, but if that’s the case I hope it stays as a form of human-computer collaboration. As my skills and motivation lie in writing code, I’ll keep stubbornly rejection any trend that clashes with them. And as I keep feeling pressured to use these things, I’ll try to come with more silly ways which I feel that at least they don’t erase my motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So will I eagerly apply what I just described? I surely will when copy and pasting my code on a chatbot window is cheaper in motivation terms than filling in the gaps myself. The way to smooth the process is to run a local model, or pay for a service. For now I don’t want to do any, so who knows. At least I feel a little less dumber now.`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By my count, there are three successful types of language model product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Chatbots like ChatGPT, which are used by hundreds of millions of people for a huge variety of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Completions coding products like Copilot or Cursor Tab, which are very niche but easy to get immediate value from&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Agentic products like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Copilot Agent mode, which have only really started working in the last six months&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are two kinds of LLM-based product that don’t work yet but may soon:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;LLM-generated feeds&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Video games that are based on AI-generated content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

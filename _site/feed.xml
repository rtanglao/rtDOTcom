The authors‚Äô proposed ‚Äòmoderated causal model‚Äô makes sense Ian R. Hadden, C√©line Darnon, Lewis Doyle, Matthew J., S√©bastien Goudeau, Andrei Cimpian :: Why the belief in meritocracy is so pervasive - ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt; via grimalkina‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina/113827451914611149&quot;&gt;toot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661324003292&quot;&gt;Ian R. Hadden, C√©line Darnon, Lewis Doyle, Matthew J., S√©bastien Goudeau, Andrei Cimpian : Why the belief in meritocracy is so pervasive - ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄòYou can make it if you try.‚Äô&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the rallying cry of meritocracy: that hard work ‚Äì not luck or family background ‚Äì determines success in life. The appeal of this idea runs deep [1]. Although people recognize, to varying degrees across countries [2], that factors other than hard work matter, they typically fail to grasp the true extent of their influence. For example, people underestimate the levels of inequalities in wealth [1] and overestimate the extent to which people move between economic strata through their own efforts [3].
This ‚Äòmyth of meritocracy‚Äô is far from cost-free: it contributes to the acceptance and legitimation of historical inequalities between demographic groups. For example, when people believe they live in a meritocratic society, they are less likely to support policies that reduce income inequality [4] and more likely to allocate resources to individuals who already have the most [5].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Instead, a more promising avenue is to invoke a more nuanced and more accurate moderated causal model, wherein the dose‚Äìresponse relation between effort and success is calibrated by external factors (Figure 1C). This conveys the reality that the same amount of effort yields greater dividends for people in more favorable social circumstances (e.g., better-resourced schools, better-connected families). Just as a seed planted in fertile soil will fare quite differently from an identical one planted in a desert, the same ‚Äòdose‚Äô of effort does not take everyone equally far. This moderated causal model, with its balance of accuracy and intuitive appeal, is likely to be a valuable communication device in efforts to debunk the myth of meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Me:: The entsh·úÅttification rot is everywhere because software is everywhere! Ed Zitron:: Never Forgive Them</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Jan 13, 2025 11:27  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/&quot;&gt;Me:: The entsh·úÅttification rot is everywhere because software is everywhere! Ed Zitron:: Never Forgive Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/&quot;&gt;Ed Zitron:: Never Forgive Them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be clear, I don‚Äôt believe that this gradual ensh·úÅttification is part of some grand, Machiavellian long game by the tech companies, but rather the product of multiple consecutive decisions made in response to short-term financial needs. Even if it was, the result would be the same ‚Äî people wouldn‚Äôt notice how bad things have gotten until it‚Äôs too late, or they might just assume that tech has always sucked, or they‚Äôre just personally incapable of using the tools that are increasingly fundamental to living in a modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are the victim of a con ‚Äî one so pernicious that you‚Äôve likely tuned it out despite the fact it‚Äôs part of almost every part of your life. It hurts everybody you know in different ways, and it hurts people more based on their socioeconomic status. It pokes and prods and twists millions of little parts of your life, and it‚Äôs everywhere, so you have to ignore it, because complaining about it feels futile, like complaining about the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre battered by the Rot Economy, and a tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value. A death cult has taken over the markets, using software as a mechanism to extract value at scale in the pursuit of growth at the cost of user happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;These people want everything from you ‚Äî to control every moment you spend working with them so that you may provide them with more ways to make money, even if doing so doesn‚Äôt involve you getting anything else in return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Jan 12, 2025 19:30 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/01/10/opinion/trump-threats-traitors&quot;&gt;Me:: Tr ädeau Derangement Syndrome (because irrational?!?!) victims: DüÑênielle Sm·úÅth, StüÑûckwell DüÑêy and all the usual CüÑûnservative suspects Max Fawcett:: Tr ämp‚Äôs threats expose the trüÑêitors in our midst ¬¶ Canada‚Äôs National Observer: Climate News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/01/10/opinion/trump-threats-traitors&quot;&gt;Max Fawcett:: Tr ämp‚Äôs threats expose the trüÑêitors in our midst ¬¶ Canada‚Äôs National Observer: Climate News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So why are so many CüÑênadian CüÑûnservatives welcoming, or at least entertaining, Tr ämp‚Äôs advances? Because J ästin Tr ädeau made them do it, apparently. His now infamous remark about how ‚Äúthere is no core identity, no mainstream in Canada‚Äù to fellow Canadian Guy Lawson in a 2015 New York Times magazine  profile, one that spoke to his father‚Äôs vision for our national culture and its unique ability to embrace difference and diversity, has somehow become an invitation to disloyalty and cowardice. Never mind that it was an attempt to articulate a more inclusive view of our national identity, one that clearly set us apart from America. For many CüÑûnservatives in Canada, Tr ädeau‚Äôs belief in a ‚ÄúpüÑûstnüÑêtional‚Äù future was all the excuse they ever needed to betray their own country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is by far the most pitiful example yet of Tr ädeau-derangement syndrome, and that‚Äôs a category with plenty of strong contenders. I assure you that there is nothing any future government could say or do that would weaken my commitment to this country and its future. My loyalty and patriotism aren‚Äôt a function of who‚Äôs in power at the moment, and they certainly aren‚Äôt about to be overridden by petty partisanship, much less a misunderstood, decade-old quote in the New York Times. If only the folks who had spent so much time and energy over the last few years publicly professing their supposed love for this country felt the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the Whole Thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://donaldgmcneiljr1954.medium.com/my-book-is-out-in-paperback-9705ec01af2e&quot;&gt;Donald G. McNeil Jr.:: My book: The Wisdom of Plagues is out in paperback. It has a new chapter with a few things‚Ä¶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My book The Wisdom of Plagues is out in paperback as of today. Since I finished writing the hardback edition in the fall of 2023 and viruses keep mutating ‚Äî as do perceptions of historical events ‚Äî Simon &amp;amp; Schuster let me write a new addendum chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most of it is about our false memories of Covid and the threats of H5N1 and the new central African strain of mpox/monkeypox. I didn‚Äôt make any wild predictions because I had to file in September and I feared H5N1 would shift course in the publishing interim. It has: it‚Äôs now clearly two separate clades, one in birds and one in cows. And both can infect humans, and as of this week, one human has died of it. That is definitely bad news. The fact that variants infecting humans turned up late in the illness of the Louisiana patient is worrying, but not terribly surprising. When a virus is under a long but weak couterattack from a human immune system, it mutates to evade that attack. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that strain will arise in nature. We still can‚Äôt say whether this virus will go pandemic or just pick humans off one by one as it has since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

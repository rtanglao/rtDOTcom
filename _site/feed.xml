ActivityPub is a federated social network protocol published by the W3C. The ActivityPub network consists of millions of users, and is implemented across a large number and variety of applications. The core concepts and extension mechanism of ActivityPub are summarized in the ecosystem overview. Advantages of ActivityPub include a conceptual foundation that follows the actor model (with pubsub layered on top), and a flexible spec which supports extensions. However, ActivityPub as currently deployed falls short on some desirable qualities, such as decentralized storage and identity. Research into evolving ActivityPub has been in progress under the Spritely project and the OcapPub writeup. This document explains how the objects/actor model of ActivityPub could be further decentralized, and with the addition of object capabilities (OCap), could enable better moderation, payment, and collaboration mechanisms. The object capability design direction provides a foundation from which unanticipated use cases can be met, whether that future involves economic uses, business communication integration, or distributed virtual worlds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is its model even sustainable? A good question—one that presupposes the European model is worth defending. It is a place blessed with walkable cities, long life expectancies and vaccinated kids who do not need to be trained to dodge school shooters. Charlemagne’s realm is a place of many flaws, lots of them enduring. But in their own plodding way, Europeans have created a place where they are guaranteed rights to what others yearn for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&lt;/code&gt; (‘ᜀ’ is Tagalog ‘a’ and ‘ᜁ’ is Tagalog ‘i’ and ‘Ӯ’ is ‘U’ in the Cyrillic alphabet since you know who is a Russian asset)&lt;/p&gt;

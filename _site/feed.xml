But I’m beginning to think the Steam Machine may end up a footnote in gaming history. What if Valve could bring PC games not just to its own living room consoles, but also to the Arm chips that billions of people have in their phones? What if you no longer had to wait for game developers to do the hard work of porting PC games to your phone, Mac, or other Arm hardware, because games built for desktop PCs could just work?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: tl-dr-ing: Courtesy of the oppressive Spanish Empire, Filipinos have been in North America since forever :-) Louisana in the mid-18th century is just one example of many! ; Wikipedia:: Saint Malo, Louisiana</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 1, 2025 15:17 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Malo,_Louisiana&quot;&gt;ME:: tl-dr-ing: Courtesy of the oppressive Spanish Empire, Filipinos have been in North America since forever :-) Louisana in the mid-18th century is just one example of many! ; Wikipedia:: Saint Malo, Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Saint Malo (Spanish: San Maló [samaˈlo]) was a small fishing village that existed along the shore of Lake Borgne in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana as early as the mid-18th century until it was destroyed by the 1915 New Orleans hurricane.[1] Located along Bayou Saint Malo, about 6 miles (9.7 km) east of the Isleño fishing village of Shell Beach, it was the first permanent settlement of Filipinos and perhaps the first Asian American settlement in the United States.[2][3][4][5]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The exact date of the establishment of Saint Malo is disputed.[6][4] The settlement may have been formed as early as 1763 or 1765 by Filipino deserters and escaped slaves of the Spanish Manila galleon trade.[7][8][9][10] The members of the community were commonly referred to as Manila men, or Manilamen, and later Tagalas.&lt;/p&gt;

Not a big deal I guess Wald basket bicyclists are not mainstream yet :-) Light Rail Kit  – Intrinsic Cycles&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Most bike lights make you choose: see or be seen. The Light Rail does both—at the same time. With two independently controlled lighting systems—one to illuminate your path and one to keep you visible to others—you get unmatched safety and control, all in one light.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: nobody mentions the considerable cost for LLMs and the considerable amount of time you need to experiment to see if an LLM works for you. Time and money require privilege and wealth;  Federico Viticci:: The AI App Experience Matters More Than Benchmarks Now - MacStories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Nov 30, 2025 07:55 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/notes/the-ai-app-experience-matters-more-than-benchmarks-now/&quot;&gt;ME:: nobody mentions the considerable cost for LLMs and the considerable amount of time you need to experiment to see if an LLM works for you. Time and money require privilege and wealth;  Federico Viticci:: The AI App Experience Matters More Than Benchmarks Now - MacStories&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Which brings me to my takeaway: from my perspective, despite a stronger baseline, there is still no single LLM that “does it all” these days. Beyond my nerdy experiments, I generally alternate between two modes: Claude for most work-related tasks, and either ChatGPT or Perplexity for web search. The combination of these two modalities gives me everything I need from modern LLMs, and it provides me with the mix of performance, design, and app integrations I like best. ... Ultimately, choosing between any LLM at the frontier of AI right now is a highly subjective matter that comes down to cost, workflow, app ecosystem, design, and, yes, pure “vibes”. Personally, I try to avoid fixating on benchmarks and instead prioritize these qualities in my decisions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: Specifications can be version controlled much easier than prompts and are therefore the future for AI assisted software development; Marc Brooker:: Kiro and the future of AI spec-driven software development</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Nov 30, 2025 07:49 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://kiro.dev/blog/kiro-and-the-future-of-software-development/&quot;&gt;ME:: Specifications can be version controlled much easier than prompts and are therefore the future for AI assisted software development; Marc Brooker:: Kiro and the future of AI spec-driven software development&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Approaching development with specifications has three significant benefits. First, it provides a way for developers and stakeholders to understand and agree on the goals of the program. It’s crisp documentation on what we want the program to do, the interface to look like, and how it should be implemented. Working at the specification level allows programmers to move faster, and spend more time thinking about the things that really matter. Second, it provides a guide for AI agents to work from, refer to, and validate their work against. A North Star to guide the work of the agent, allowing it to take on larger tasks without getting lost. Third, the specification tames the chaos of prompt-driven vibe coding on large code bases, moving away from an ad-hoc exercise in prompt engineering, to way for programmers to crisply express their intent to agents. A specification is a kind of (version controlled, human-readable) super prompt.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

LLMs and code interpreters. LLMs and databases. LLMs and browsers. LLMs and SMT solvers. These systems can do things, today, that LLMs alone simply can’t, and will never be able to do. More importantly, they can do things today orders of magnitude more cheaply and quickly than LLMs can, even in the case where they can do the same things.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 8, 2025 05:45 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/2025/running-claude-code-in-a-loop&quot;&gt;ME:: I wonder how many tokens this will burn :-)  Again nobody talks about the \(\)$ i.e. the costs; Anand Chowdhary:: continuous-claude CLI tool: Running Claude Code in a loop &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/2025/running-claude-code-in-a-loop&quot;&gt;Anand Chowdhary:: continuous-claude CLI tool: Running Claude Code in a loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tools like Dependabot handle dependency updates, but Continuous Claude can also fix post-update breaking changes using release notes. You could run a GitHub Actions workflow every morning that checks for updates and continuously fixes issues until all tests pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Large refactoring tasks become manageable: breaking a monolith into modules, modernizing callbacks to async/await, or updating to new style guidelines. It could perform a series of 20 pull requests over a weekend, each doing part of the refactor with full CI validation. There’s a whole class of tasks that are too mundane for humans but still require attention to avoid breaking the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The model mirrors human development practices. Claude Code handles the grunt work, but humans remain in the loop through familiar mechanisms like PR reviews. Download the CLI from GitHub to get started: AnandChowdhary/continuous-claude&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 bone-in chicken thighs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kosher salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cracked black pepper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ teaspoon crushed rosemary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4 carrots peeled and diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 turnip peeled and diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 parsnips peeled and diced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parsley for garnish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Super hilarious when Canadian bloggers, vloggers, etc recommend products that don't ship to Canada #RealFreeTradeWithEntireWorldNotJustSuperLoopholeFilledUSMCAWithTheUSAAndMexico</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;e.g. The Shifter guy in his YouTube video:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/j01meiJyLeI&quot;&gt;Cycling Gift Guide 2025: Things I Actually Use&lt;/a&gt; recommending the Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles. I tried to buy it and LOL they don’t ship to Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This happens all the time. Canada  / USA free trade has always been a sham and scam. #BanMulroneyReaganEtcEtcNeverLikedThemNeverWill :-) #RealFreeTradeWithEntireWorldNotJustSuperLoopholeFilledUSMCAWithTheUSAAndMexico&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having said all the above, I do like the Shifter guy, Tom Babin, and his videos :-)

  &lt;li&gt;November 30, 2025: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rolandtanglao.com/2025/11/30/p0835-light-rail/&quot;&gt;ME:: Be seen plus SEE bicycle Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles looks good but how do I install this on my Wald basket (the basket blocks lights mounted on the handlebar)? Not a big deal I guess Wald basket bicyclists are not mainstream yet :-) Light Rail Kit – Intrinsic Cycles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>ME:: All the benefits sound plausible but I still think self driving cars won't work in 2034 and we'd be better improving 'low tech' non self driving trains and buses ; The Economist:: Self-driving cars will transform urban economies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 7, 2025 02:29 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/B6zPd#selection-1359.0-1363.560&quot;&gt;ME:: All the benefits sound plausible but I still think self driving cars won’t work in 2034 and we’d be better improving ‘low tech’ non self driving trains and buses ; The Economist:: Self-driving cars will transform urban economies&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;San Francisco may not yet have seen job losses, but that is likely to change as costs fall. America is home to 1m taxi and bus drivers, as well as over 3m truck drivers—adding up to 3% of the working population. Other potential losers are less obvious. Without car accidents there will, for instance, be less demand for personal-injury lawyers. If people stop buying cars, dealers and used-car salesmen will go. Robotaxis might compete with short-haul air travel and even hotels if some are kitted out with beds. Although new jobs will be created—in, say, managing fleets or manning depots—they will hardly make up for the losses. Social disruption is likely; at the same time, job losses will be an opportunity. Workforces in the rich world are shrinking as populations age. Freeing people to work elsewhere might be invaluable. ... Productivity in the transport industry would surge. The rest of the economy ought to perk up, too. An average working American spends just under an hour commuting each day, against eight hours on the job. Turning even a sliver of that into work could boost output appreciably, says Will Denyer of Gavekal, a research firm. Self-driving cars offer a smoother ride, which, along with better suspension, should make it easier to get work done onboard. And fewer accidents not only mean fewer human tragedies—they also mean lower hospital and rehabilitation bills.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;COUNTERPOINT to me :-) :: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Slotkin neurosurgeon:: NYT: The Data on Self-Driving Cars Is Clear. We Have to Change Course&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Federal leadership is essential. Current regulations require companies to report crashes, but not the number of miles driven or where. We need the denominator, not just the numerator. Data-reporting requirements should include crash rates, miles driven and where, and safety performance. Independent auditors should verify this data against police reports, insurance claims and privacy-protected medical records. ... This transformation will happen. We can guide it toward a safer, more equitable future or let it unfold haphazardly around us. There’s a future in which manual driving becomes uncommon, perhaps even quaint, the way riding horses is today. It’s a future where we no longer accept thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of broken spines as the price of mobility. It’s time to stop treating this like a tech moonshot and start treating it like a public health intervention.&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;– I still think the full data with the denominator will show it’s not safe and barring a breakthrough it won’t be safe by 2034. Love to be proven wrong :-)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>ME:: go 'Te Hiku, Apertus and other smaller models for preserving small languages' go :-) ! ; Ethan Zuckerman:: Gramsci's Nightmare: AI, Platform Power and the Automation of Cultural Hegemony</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 6, 2025 23:15 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanzuckerman.com/2025/12/05/gramscis-nightmare-ai-platform-power-and-the-automation-of-cultural-hegemony/&quot;&gt;ME:: go ‘Te Hiku, Apertus and other smaller models for preserving small languages’ go :-) ! ; Ethan Zuckerman:: Gramsci’s Nightmare: AI, Platform Power and the Automation of Cultural Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethanzuckerman.com/2025/12/05/gramscis-nightmare-ai-platform-power-and-the-automation-of-cultural-hegemony/&quot;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman:: Gramsci’s Nightmare: AI, Platform Power and the Automation of Cultural Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m inspired by a project in New Zealand launched by a cultural organization called Te Hiku Media. The CEO of Te Hiku, Peter-Lucas Jones, is Maori and the organization has worked since 1990 to put voices in te reo Maori, the Maori language, on the radio, ending decades during which the New Zealand government suppressed the teaching and speaking of the language. A few years ago, he asked his husband, Keoni Mahelona, a native Hawaiian and a polymathic scholar and technologist, to help the organization build a website. The two ended up realizing that the three decades of recorded Maori speech in the radio archives represented a cultural heritage that likely existed nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That archive of spoken te reo Maori becomes more powerful if it’s indexed, and that requires transcribing many thousands of hours of tape, or building a speech to text model. Mahelona visited with gatherings of Maori elders and explained how machine learning models worked, what a speech to text model might make possible and got buy-in and consent from the broader community. That allowed Te Hiku to recruit a truly amazing number of participants into the project of recording snippets of spoken Maori. Over ten days, 2500 speakers recorded 300 hours of the language, creating 200,000 labeled snippets of speech. Jones and Mahelona relied on a set of cultural institutions to accomplish this – they held a contest between traditional canoe racing teams to see which could record the most phrases. They ended up with training data that powers a language transcription model that is 92% accurate… and they’ve got engaged volunteers who could work to correct transcription errors and add data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This Maori ML project is already being used to power a language learning application, similar to DuoLingo, but using tools built by the community rather than extracted from them. Young Maori speakers are able to check their pronunciation against a database of voices of elders who’ve worked to keep the language alive. And the 30+ years of audio that Te Hiku has collected are now both an indexable archive, but also potentially the corpus for a small LLM built around Maori language, knowledge and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Te Hiku corpus is probably too small to build a large language model using the techniques we use today, which rely on ready access to massive data sets. But there are projects similar in spirit, notably Apertus, a Swiss project to create an open, multilingual language model that emphasizes the importance of non-English languages, especially Romansh and Swiss German. 40% of Apertus’s model is non-English… which gives you a sense of just how dominant English is in most models… and the goal is to build models for chatbots, translation systems and educational tools that emphasize transparency and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

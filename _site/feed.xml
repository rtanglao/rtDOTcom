  &lt;p&gt;“But I don’t have time to write every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone’s got limited hours and too many demands on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But I think we’re probably talking about fifteen to twenty minutes here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Maybe thirty on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You’re not writing War and Peace. You’re writing enough to clarify one thought, work through one problem, capture one observation. That’s perhaps the length of three or four text messages to a friend, composed without chatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are witnessing another SciFi idea turned into reality. A startup company, Starcloud, launched and placed in orbit the first AI Data Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This project is not about cheap power and cooling and locating fires in California. This project is about taking data and moving it outside of any jurisdiction, oversight and control. I am sure that there will be lots of takers for that offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The recurrent pattern? This is not SciFi turned reality project. It’s just a new place to hide family jewels.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: pre magellan Philippines was super interesting; Celestino C. Macachor:: Searching for Kali in the Indigenous Chronicles of Jovito Abellana By: Retracing our Past on Pandan Leaves – Pre-colonial Cebu</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Nov 20, 2025 15:00 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20120703210211/http://cebueskrima.s5.com/custom3.html&quot;&gt;ME:: pre magellan Philippines was super interesting; Celestino C. Macachor:: Searching for Kali in the Indigenous Chronicles of Jovito Abellana By: Retracing our Past on Pandan Leaves – Pre-colonial Cebu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Legends and myth have been told about how the ancient name of Cebu City or as some old timers fondly call Sugbo originated.  None of these versions so far have held up to the scrutiny of scholars and historians until Jovito Abellana published his book Bisaya Patronymesis Sri Visjaya where he extensively wrote about Aginid, Bayok sa atong Tawarik (Glide on, Odes to our History)[1].  The Aginid a discovery made by Jovito Abellana’s great grandfather is probably the only pre-colonial chronicle of the history of Cebu written in ancient alibata script on pandan leaves and other indigenous materials.  Unfortunately most of the materials were lost in the subsequent upheaval that followed the Spanish defeat by Cebuano guerillas and the ensuing Filipino American War.     Amidst strong support by some scholars to institutionalize the Aginid, the Cebu Normal University published it in 1998.  Abellana wrote it in alibata (Cebuano hieroglyphic) form with an English translation.    The Aginid tells of the fiery story of pre-colonial Cebu then known as Sugbo – which means scorched earth.  This version on the origins of Sugbo, is important as it establishes the basic hypothesis why eskrima was invented in the first place – in defense against Moro invaders.  And to add credence to the discovery of the Aginid by Jovito Abellana, other cognates of the word Sugbo can be found in the Cebuano lexicon such as: sugba – to grill, subu’ – to forge steel, sug-ang – set a cooking fire, sugnod – to burn.     Let us go back to the story of how Sugbo got its name.  In the olden times Sugbo (now present day Cebu City) was part of the island of Pulua Kang Dayang or Kangdaya.  The ancient poem Diyandi tells us that so many hundred years ago natives had burned the town Sugbo as a way to drive away Muslim invaders from Mindanao.  The natives would then flee to the mountains and later launch a counter offensive against the demoralized and exhausted invaders.  The first ruler of Sugbo Sri Lumay who came from Sumatra successfully repulsed the invaders with his scorched earth tactics.  Thus the place became known as Sugbo or scorched town. Jovito Abellana translated the Diyandi which was written in ancient alibata script and probably written during the time of Datu Tupas.  It is a stirring chronicle of the story of the rich culture and colorful history of  pre-colonial Cebu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aginid, Bayok sa Atong Tawarik (Glide on, Odes to Our History)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Extracted from Marivir Montebon’s book Retracing Our Roots – A Journey into Cebu’s Pre-Colonial Past[2] are excerpts of the story of pre-colonial Cebu according to the Aginid,  Bayok sa atong Tawarik (Glide on, Odes to Our History) as translated by Jovito Abellana:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Sri Lumay of Sumatra settled in Sugbo with his son, Sri Alho, ruling the south known as Sialo which included Valladolid, Carcar, up to Santander.     His other son, Sri Ukob, ruled the north known as Nahalin which includes the present towns of Consolacion, Liloan, Compostela, Danao, Carmen, and Bantayan.   As a ruler, Sri Lumay was known to be strict, merciless, and brave.  He assigned magalamags to teach his people to read and write ancient letterings.  He ordered routinary patrol by boats from Nahalin to Sialo by his mangubats (warriors).     A strict ruler, Sri Lumay was a loving person that not a single slave ran away from him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Dominant Hegemony (DH) historically &amp; today choose to NOT acknowledge their privilege &amp; value their convenience (for food delivery, mobility etc) over paying non-DH folks a living wage. Cities aren't going away despite pundits and their dreams :-) of  self driving cars (which we don't need and won't work; we already have public transit, trains and buses) and food delivery.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The DH is fine anywhere: suburbia, urban core, etc because everything comes to them &amp;amp; is built for them so it doesn’t matter where they live. Since the 1918 pandemic, pundits have been wrongly predicting the demise of cities. Wrong then, wrong now :-)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Apeman R1 Seeker rear view real-time video camera shows lots people illegally driving with their daytime running lights OFF behind me in the city of Vancouver.</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Law abiding people don’t exist when driving cars (as well as bicycles; bicycles aren’t 4000 pounds of daily danger, the consequences of law breaking are much lower on a bicycle especially an “acoustic” :-) one; I don’t condone breaking traffic laws when bicycling or driving.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ride (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/athletes/22831652&quot;&gt;my rides on Strava&lt;/a&gt;) 12km (6km each way Trout Lake to Gastown) Monday-Friday and I see in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/667837446/seeker-4k-bike-dashcam-and-safety-lighting-system&quot;&gt;Apeman R1 seeker rear view real time video camera&lt;/a&gt; I got in 2023 or was it 2024 :-) at least a couple of cars or trucks with their daytime running lights off. These people are probably the ones who complain about bicyclists not following traffic laws LOL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a good time :-) see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drivesmartbc.ca/safety-equipment/viewpoint-daytime-running-lights&quot;&gt;VIEWPOINT - Daytime Running Lights&lt;/a&gt; which has this juicy &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Daytime running lights have been mandatory for vehicles in Canada since 1990. It appears many drivers and vehicle dealers are not aware of this requirement. Having driven thousands of kilometres over the last 40 years I know that DRL can help prevent accidents particularly on poor light and rainy conditions.&lt;/code&gt;

        <title>ME:: tl;dr-ing Tariffs are justified for two reasons: 1. to pay for international freight emissions 2. social, fiscal and environmental dumping ; Thomas Piketty:: Rethinking world trade</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Nov 17, 2025 02:14 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2025/10/07/rethinking-world-trade/&quot;&gt;ME:: tl;dr-ing Tariffs are justified for two reasons: 1. to pay for international freight emissions 2. social, fiscal and environmental dumping 3. ; Thomas Piketty:: Rethinking world trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2025/10/07/rethinking-world-trade/&quot;&gt;Thomas Piketty:: Rethinking world trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first reason for implementing tariffs is that international freight generates pollution that accounts for 7% of global emissions. Economists have long underestimated this environmental cost, using a low value for the metric ton of carbon (between €100 and €200). However, the worsening of global warming has led to a reassessment. The costs stemming from emissions – natural disasters, decline in economic activity and so on – are now estimated at about €1,000 per ton, if not more, without even factoring in loss of well-being and non-economic costs. Using this value, one would need to apply average tariffs of around 15% on global trade flows to compensate for warming linked to freight, with significant variations depending on the type of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The second justification for tariffs is social, fiscal and environmental dumping. Some countries apply less stringent regulations than others, allowing producers based there to undercut competitors. In practical terms, China currently accounts for 30% of global emissions, with exported emissions making up about 20% of this (or 6% of the global total). At €1,000 per ton, average tariffs of about 80% would be needed on Chinese exports to account for this environmental cost. If focusing only on net exported emissions (after subtracting imported emissions), which is about 10% of China’s emissions (3% of the global total), the necessary tariffs would be around 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now to social dumping. Wages account for 49% of gross domestic product in China, compared to 64% in Europe. This distorts competition and would require compensatory tariffs of about 15%. A similar calculation can be made for fiscal dumping, especially regarding corporate taxes and state subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As with carbon, the aim is not to penalize China per se, but to encourage it to pay better wages, at which point the compensatory tax could be lifted. China has no need to accumulate endless trade surpluses; it should first continue its plans for decarbonization (which are further along than in the US, for example) and increase its wages and domestic demand. In the long run, if the US does not change course, Europe and China will have to impose significant sanctions on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In any case, tariffs are not an end in themselves: They can be dispensed with if binding agreements are put in place to achieve the same objectives. They can also be replaced by targeted financial sanctions if those prove more effective. The exact amounts should be determined following thorough democratic deliberation, conducted transparently, ideally within transnational assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pink-pasta---fettuccine-with-beet-smoked-salmon-and-feta&quot;&gt;Pink Pasta - Fettuccine with Beet, Smoked Salmon, and Feta&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;½ lb (225gms) uncooked fettuccine noodles, gluten-free or regular
    1 medium beet (~2½/6.5cm diameter) (1 packed cup when shredded)
    ½ medium onion
    2 tablespoons butter
    ¼ teaspoon salt
    ¼ teaspoon pepper
    1 cup chicken broth
    ¼ cup dry white vermouth or dry white wine
    ½ cup (120ml) heavy cream
    3.5 oz (100gms) smoked salmon slices (about ½ cup, packed)
    1 tablespoon capers
    ½ cup (60gms) crumbled feta cheese, plus a bit extra for garnish
    chopped fresh dill or parsley for serving - optional&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Set a large pot of salted water on to boil. (I use 1 teaspoon salt.) When it boils, add the fettuccine and cook for one minute less than the package recommends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;While the water is boiling and the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Peel the beet with a vegetable peeler, leaving the stem intact for a handhold while grating it. Shred the beet on the large holes of a cheese grater. Dice the onion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Melt the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Add the shredded beet, diced onion, salt, and pepper, and cook until the beets are wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Add the chicken broth and the vermouth or wine. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the cream and keep warm until the pasta is finished cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Reserve a few thin slices of smoked salmon to garnish the finished pasta, chop the rest into large chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the pasta is one minute short of being al dente (you still want it to have a good firmness to it), drain it and add it to the beets. Toss to coat the pasta strands and cook for one minute. Remove from the heat and add the smoked salmon, capers, and ½ cup of feta cheese.  Toss gently to distribute everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Serve immediately, garnished with the reserved smoked salmon strips, feta crumbles, and chopped dill or parsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Serves 2 as a main course, or 4 as a first course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

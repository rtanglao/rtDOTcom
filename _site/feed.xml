        <title>eusebeia:So if you are running Linux (I'm using Debian) and are having trouble with the printer functions of the MFC-7220, try installing it as a HL-2060 instead. It might just be the thing you need. </title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of I might need this someday :-) ---&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/mfc7220&quot;&gt;From CUPS and the Brother MFC-7220 USB printer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After a long, frustrating search, I finally found a clue in an obscure post somewhere in the Ubuntu forums, hinting that CUPS actually comes with a driver that works with the MFC-7220. It appears that the printer part of MFC-7220 is identical to Brother's HL-2060 printer; so all I had to do, was to uninstall the MFC-7220 drivers, delete the printer from the CUPS web interface, and then re-add the printer and select the HL-2060 driver for the printer. After this very non-obvious choice of printer driver, the printer started to work perfectly again.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Google to demand regular Android security patches from OEMs: Dave Kleidermacher who leads mobile security at Google:this will really lead to a massive increase in the number of devices, and users, receiving regular security patches</title>

&lt;li&gt;Google to demand regular Android security patches from OEMs:&lt;a href=&quot;https://vowe.net/archives/017137.html&quot;&gt;via the fabulous vowe.net: Dave Kleidermacher who leads mobile security at Google:&amp;quot;...this will really lead to a massive increase in the number of devices, and users, receiving regular security patches&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh really, how massive? all OEMs that use Google Play? 50% 75%, 100%, of the OEMs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By when? 2020, 2021, end of 2019?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to believe :-) but I don&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ll believe it when S*msung agrees to this. Until then Android is one massive security headache except for Pixel devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Eero WiFi router with 2 beacons has seemingly solved our WiFi issues in our 1600 square foot 3 story flat</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eero.com/shop/home-wifi-system&quot;&gt;The Eero wifi router with 2 beacons&lt;/a&gt;  has seemingly solved our WiFi issues in our 1600 square foot three story flat. Speedtest now consistently shows 10Mbits/second down and 1.58Mbits/second up which is much more than before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to configure, easy to setup. What could possibly go wrong :-) ??!? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Far better than the two kickstarter routers I had before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Gemini Keyboard PDA keyboard is amazing (and better than the keyboard on the GPD Pocket!)</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gemini-pda-android-linux-keyboard-mobile-device--2#/&quot;&gt;Gemini Keyboard PDA&lt;/a&gt;  keyboard is amazing (and better than the keyboard on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/25/p1-gpd-pocket-chugging-away-and-retrieving-neighbourhood-names-on-ig-2015-vancouver-lat-long/&quot;&gt;GPD Pocket&lt;/a&gt; !)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dream: if Linux runs well (Android 7.1 works fine!) and the GPS works great in Linux, then I can put in a SIM card and re-create &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/06/p1-pythonista-script-to-get-gps-coordinates-on-ios/&quot;&gt;gpsgamelan.py&lt;/a&gt;  in a 2018 stylee :-)&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Surface Book 2 Drivers were re-installed by Hamilton again Monday May 7, 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surface Book 2 Drivers were re-installed by Hamilton again Monday May 7, 2018 &amp;lt;-- this is getting ridiculous :-) oh well the laptop still works well especially Ubuntu in the Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/02/p1-hamilton-uninstalled-my-surface-book2-wifi-drivers-1may2018/&quot;&gt;Hamilton uninstalled and re-installed my wifi drivers on May 1, 2018: let&amp;#39;s see if this fixes the wifi not working after about 1-2 weeks problem on my surface book 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think rebooting would work better or faster or just as well?!?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess Marvell, M*crosoft, somebody, anybody :-)  need to fix this !&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>The Augmented Social Network: Building identity and trust into the next-generation Internet by Ken Jordan, Jan Hauser, and Steven Foster: nothing has changed, the internet is still at a cross roads</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988&quot;&gt;The Augmented Social Network: Building identity and trust into the next-generation Internet by Ken Jordan, Jan Hauser, and Steven Foster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We forgot about bots and automated influencing back in 2003. Nobody saw that coming! We thought it would be commercial interests not state actors that would pervert the internet!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, though nothing has changed the internet is still at a cross-roads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

Not to over-simplify a complex issue, but the Internet is at a crossroads and has to choose which path to take, what kinds of interactivity to allow. For example, will people on the Net be able to distribute video from their own computers? Will people in Russia have access to U.S. blogs? Will peer-to-peer interactions be permissible, or might they be strictly limited? Decisions are being made today about what behavior will be allowed online tomorrow. No less important than the above examples are the questions: How will each individual be represented online, and how will this effect the way people are able to meet each other and organize on the Net? Will the &quot;next generation&quot; online community serve only commercial interests, or will it also contribute to the public good? If the public interest sector does not act now, these questions will be answered for us, and a tremendous opportunity to reinvigorate democracy may be lost.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Pythonista script to get GPS and text adapt to make music like my 2010 N900 gpsgamelan.py script?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Pontifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/n8henrie/60b2e9390355bc8e24dd&quot;&gt;gps.py from n8henrie gets the GPS coordinates on iPhone or iPad and texts it&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How hard would it be to modify it to play music like my script from 2010 for the N900? &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2010/07/06/gpsgamelan-py-is-ok-but-i-want-real-music-use-12-major-keys-with-10-chords/&quot;&gt;gpsgamelan.py is ok, but i want real music - use 12 major keys with 10 chords&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

As a beginning graduate student in the social sciences, what sort of software should you use to do your work? More importantly, what principles should guide your choices? This article offers some answers. The short version is: you should use tools that give you more control over the process of data analysis and writing. I recommend you write prose and code using a good text editor; analyze quantitative data with R or Stata; minimize error by storing your work in a simple format (plain text is best), and make a habit of documenting what you’ve done. For data analysis, consider using a format like Rmarkdown and tools like Knitr to make your work more easily reproducible for your future self. Use Pandoc to turn your plain-text documents into PDF, HTML, or Word files to share with others. Keep your projects in a version control system. Back everything up regularly. Make your computer work for you by automating as many of these steps as you can. To help you get started, I briefly discuss a drop-in set of useful defaults to get started with Emacs (a powerful, free text-editor). I share some templates and style files that can get you quickly from plain text to various output formats. And I point to several alternatives, because no humane person should recommend Emacs without presenting some other options as well.

        <title>Me:: ML should belong to governments like nuclear fission and fusion Alexander Hartley:: To Whom Does the World Belong? - Boston Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Dec 13, 2024 09:25 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/to-whom-does-the-world-belong&quot;&gt;Me:: ML should belong to governments like nuclear fission and fusion Alexander Hartley:: To Whom Does the World Belong? - Boston Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing:: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/to-whom-does-the-world-belong&quot;&gt;To Whom Does the World Belong? - Boston Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We may wish to consider a still more fundamental question. If AI is as potentially capital-accumulating, dangerous, and powerful as its developers claim, should we allow private companies to hold patents on this technology at all? If the idea seems crazy, that‚Äôs only a sign of our neoliberal times. Entrepreneur Charles Jennings, himself a former tech CEO, draws a comparison between AI and nuclear fission and fusion. When Harry Truman created the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1946, he concentrated ownership and authority over nuclear power in an arm of government relatively insulated from day-to-day politics. The federal government‚Äôs role in nationalizing nuclear weapons was that of owner, not operator‚Äîit outsourced most of the work. The military possessed finished bombs, Westinghouse built and operated nuclear energy plants, but the AEC controlled the core and had all the leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton fears what nationalization would mean in the hands of figures like D‚≠ïnald Trüá∫mp, VlüÖ∞dimir Püá∫tin, and Xi JInping. Here the analogy with nuclear technology presents a bleak sort of consolation. Concentrating power over atomic weapons in the hands of the executive branch has been, by any measure, terrifically dangerous. But could anyone seriously argue we would be in a safer world than the one we are in if this power were concentrated in the private branches of the military-industrial complex, and if nuclear blueprints and resources were the private possessions of large corporations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They‚Äôre just businesses‚Äîoften run with distrust or contempt for their users.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(of course read the whole thing:: &lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com/@tedgioia/p-152031677]&quot;&gt;Ted Gioia:: Are Social Media Platforms the Next Dying Malls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start, malls were artificial constructs designed to maximize profits for the owners‚Äîand this was insufficient to create a true community, a sense of shared purpose, or enduring loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same is true of social media. The owners of these platforms don‚Äôt even pretend otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three years, they stopped trying to build communities, and shifted to promoting addictive scrolling and swiping. They manipulate their users with a smug attitude that can only be described as contempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just look at the terms and conditions. Imagine launching a business in your neighborhood and telling new customers this‚Ä¶

        <title>Ducky Sherwood:: oral minocycline significantly helped 89% of long COVID patients 2024-12-07 General ‚Äì Pandemics in British Columbia</title>

There was improvement in fatigue, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, brain fog, disequilibrium, orthostatic intolerance, and neuropathic pain. (Minocycline is an antibiotic, but also has a number of protective effects on neurons.)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;- Read the whole thing! Need more studies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;caveats-again-quoting-ducky&quot;&gt;Caveats again quoting Ducky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oral minocycline does frequently give unpleasant levels of nausea and/or dizziness, so it‚Äôs not an ideal medicine. Also please note that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not everyone was helped;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who had ME/CFS for longer were helped less;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This was not a randomized trial ‚Äî there was no control group, so partly this might be placebo effect.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These weren‚Äôt the sickest Long COVID patients: people had to be able to stand and walk (and, it appears, to come to a hospital) in order to participate in the study.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of the improvement was in people who had Long COVID for less than six months, so maybe they would have recovered on their own.
However, it is encouraging news!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is really, really confusing

Do you find this all hopelessly confusing? I don‚Äôt blame you. I‚Äôm a professional web developer and a Python engineer of 20+ years and I can just about understand and internalize the above set of rules.

I don‚Äôt really have any suggestions for where we go from here. This stuff is hard to use. The more features and capabilities we pile onto these systems the harder it becomes to obtain true mastery of them and really understand what they can do and how best to put them into practice.

Maybe this doesn‚Äôt matter? I don‚Äôt know anyone with true mastery of Excel‚Äîto the point where they could compete in last week‚Äôs Microsoft Excel World Championship‚Äîand yet plenty of people derive enormous value from Excel despite only scratching the surface of what it can do.

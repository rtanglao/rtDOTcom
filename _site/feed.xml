        <title>ME:: tl;dr-ing: Because there is no payment deficit, the new 15% tariffs imposed by The Convicted Criminal are also illegal ; Thom Hogan:: Weekly News and Commentary for February 16 to 23 ¦ Cameras and Photography</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Feb 24, 2026 07:52 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bythom.com/newsviews/weekly-news-and-commentary-7.html&quot;&gt;ME:: tl;dr-ing: Because there is no payment deficit, the new 15% tariffs imposed by The Convicted Criminal are also illegal ; Thom Hogan:: Weekly News and Commentary for February 16 to 23 ¦ Cameras and Photography&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– &lt;strong&gt;QUOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;So, two things about that: (1) Congress will have to act within 150 days to extend these new 15% tariffs, and that's unlikely in the current environment because it would happen just before the next election; and (2) the reasoning is once again problematic, and will likely get tested by the courts as once again exceeding the authority given by Congress. Section 122 doesn't actually refer to &quot;trade deficit&quot; it refers to &quot;payment deficit&quot;, of which the US has very little (the US heavily exports &quot;services&quot;, which balances out &quot;trade&quot;). In essence, we have an autocratic regime that can't read and has indicated that they will do what they want and keep trying to find some methodology that might make tariffs stick. In other words, businesses still have no idea what their costs are (and will be), as they keep fluctuating as the tariff battle continues. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>ME:: tl;dr-ing just like AIDS, COVID-19 doesn't have a sterilizing vaccine aka cure in 2026 ; Laurie Garrett, author of the 1994 Pulitzer Prize winning book, 'The Coming Plague', in Foreign Policy Magazine::  May 2023:: The COVID Public Health Emergency Is Over. What Does That Even Mean?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/&quot;&gt;Discovered&lt;/a&gt;: Feb 24, 2026 00:58 (UTC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230524123648/https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/05/09/pandemic-covid-who-epidemic-aids/&quot;&gt;ME:: tl;dr-ing just like AIDS, COVID-19 doesn’t have a sterilizing vaccine aka cure in 2026 ; Laurie Garrett, author of the 1994 Pulitzer Prize winning book, ‘The Coming Plague’, in Foreign Policy Magazine::  May 2023:: The COVID Public Health Emergency Is Over. What Does That Even Mean?&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;– archive.is link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/oPoqC&quot;&gt;https://archive.is/oPoqC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;QUOTE:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read the whole thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20230524123648/https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/05/09/pandemic-covid-who-epidemic-aids/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett, author of the 1990s Pulitzer Prize winning book, the coming plague in May 2023:: The COVID Public Health Emergency Is Over. What Does That Even Mean?&lt;/a&gt;  &amp;lt;– archive.is link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.is/oPoqC&quot;&gt;https://archive.is/oPoqC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As was the case with AIDS, the muted victory now declared that COVID-19 was “won” with a tough mix of behavioral restrictions (less sex for AIDS, fewer crowded events for COVID-19), barriers (condoms/masks), drugs (antiretrovirals/antivirals) and “vaccines.” Dutch doctor Joep Lange famously declared some 20 years ago that anti-HIV drugs so effectively blocked transmission of the virus that treatment is prevention. Out of the limelight, in meetings with HIV research colleagues, Lange argued that the drugs, taken as prophylactics—dubbed PrEP—by sexually active individuals, were “vaccines,” as the medicines prevented most lasting infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And in practice, PrEP is now widely used to prevent HIV infection. But the drugs aren’t genuine vaccines, akin to measles immunization, for example, as they can’t be administered and boosted to provide lifelong protection against infection. Thus, the financial spigot must flow in perpetuity, and sexually active adults who fear their partners carry HIV, and drug users that share syringes, must take their PrEP assiduously and frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is no AIDS cure, despite a handful of isolated cases of individuals treated with heroic measures to effectively clear HIV from their bodies. And there is no HIV vaccine.
We have followed the same path with COVID-19. The mRNA “vaccines” used by billions of people do not block COVID-19 infection or prevent the vaccinated individual from passing the virus on to others. Moreover, vaccine efficacy in preventing acute COVID-19 disease and death wanes within months, as the viral evolution process appears today to be primarily a natural selection phenomenon aimed at evading host immune systems. (Natural infection also provides very short-lived protection against future reinfections and severe disease.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;previously&quot;&gt;Previously&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;November 6, 2022: &lt;a href=&quot;http://rolandtanglao.com/2022/11/06/p1544-1589344554586886144/&quot;&gt;Laurie Garrett on Twitter: ‘There’s a cottage  industry is tearing apart the @ProPublica + @VanityFair ‘expose’ of the  origins of #SARSCoV2 – so many reports on the inaccuracies &amp;amp;  failures in the story, it seems hard to imagine more. But @janeqiuchina  is a Chinese-speaking writer, &amp;amp; this thread is intense.’ /  Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

What you publish is solely subject to public law. No 3rd parties hold a stake, nobody else imposes any rules on you. This is because you publish on your own property. Which is possible because housekeeping is no more than the known follow/unfollow/block/unblock content moderation of your own single account. You do that by yourself. There are no scripting engines or databases, no technical updates required. You can focus solely on the message to deliver. You build an online presence on your own digital property, robust for decades if you decide so. #Seppo! is built on mature web standards (e.g. ActivityPub), a european technology stack, inspectable plain-text storage, is security aware and decentralised. It is made for but not limited to off-the-shelf static webspace as offered by numerous vendors all over the EU. #Seppo! targets individuals and small organisations joining the #Fediverse with max. 10k followers, optionally cross-posting to the closed platforms.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But at what cost? And with what margins? Profits seduced the company right into a quicksand trap. McGee and his interviewees have a difficult time imagining it escape.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

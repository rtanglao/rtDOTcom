    <p>See I was right, <a href="http://www.globalprblogweek.com/archives/pr_is_dead.php">PR is dead</a>!

<p>I don't believe in messages.<br />
I don't believe in spin.<br />
I believe in communication.<br />
I believe in conversations.<br />
I believe in relationships.<br />

People who believe and who can tread the delicate line between public and private, and the myriad of laws and regulations and write in an informal, natural and conversational voice. People who can tell your company's stories.
</p>

<p>Most often, this will be full time employees. This will be BOTH your C level executives AND other employees.

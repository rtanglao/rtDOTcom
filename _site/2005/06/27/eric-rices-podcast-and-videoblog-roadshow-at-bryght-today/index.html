    <p>[Crossposted from <a href="http://bryght.com/blog/roland-tanglao/eric-rices-podcast-and-videoblog-roadshow-at-bryght-today">Bryght</a>]
</p>
<p>Here's the plan:
</p>
<ol><li>Meet at <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>, Suite 203, <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=525+seymour+street+vancouver+bc&amp;spn=0.029114,0.059223&amp;hl=en">525 Seymour Street</a> at 5p.m.
</li><li>At 5:30ish, we'll blogwalk/videblog/podcast our way over to <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/reviews/restaurants/phnom.penh">Phnom Penh</a> (<a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=244+east+georgia+street+vancouver+bc&amp;spn=0.029115,0.059223&amp;hl=en">244 East Georgia Street</a>) from Bryght. Hopefully the weather will cooperate!</li><li>At 7p.m., we'll have a Vietnamese/Cambodian dinner at Phnom Penh (Reservations for 2 tables of 10 under the name of <a href="http://www.ericrice.com/">Eric "White" :-) Rice</a> !).</li><li>After dinner, we'll go somewhere to be determined to continue the conversation.</li></ol>
<p>Come one, come all. You are welcome to join us blogger or not, podcaster or not, videblogger or not. Feel free to bring your camera, video equipment, microphone or just yourself and talk about blogging, podcasting, videoblogging, or whatever you want! Eric can give us lots of tips on how to improve your audio, video and blogging</p>
<p>And it's totally flexible, you are free to come whenever you are free e.g. if you can't make our meetup at Bryght at 5p.m., no problem, if you can't make the Phnom Penh dinner at 7p.m., no problem.  Just call Roland at 604 729 7924 and let us know when you will join us.</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>Start:
June 27, 2005 - 5:00pm<br />
Location:<br />
Bryght, Suite 203 - 525 Seymour Street, Vancouver, BC, V6B 3H7<br /><p>Podcast and Videoblog roadshow in Vancouver at Bryght June 27, 2005
</p><p>Curious about videoblogging, podcasting and blogging? Bring your MP3 recorder, laptop, microphone and camera down to Bryght and learn from one of the masters, Eric Rice. Got no hardware? No worries, just bring yourself! Love to meet all the local Vancouver podcasters, videobloggers, and bloggers past present and future. We'll meet for a bit and then do an informal podwalk/videoblog walk/blogwalk and then have dinner and afterwards perhaps some surprises after dinner. It's totally casual so feel free to drop in for as long as you'd like for any part of the evening. Just RSVP to let us know when to expect you.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://kriskrug.com/">Kris</a> briefly lent me his N82 but asked for it back to a friend today. So I looked up how many photos I have taken with the N82 since August 26, 2008 when Kris lent it to me: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/n82photo">2300 public photos</a>! Lots of blurry ones but some decent ones. Last N82 observations after 2 months of use primarily from my bicycle but also private ones of of the kid :</p>
<ol>
  <li>It's the North American Version so none of the recent software upgrades (No, I didn't consider changing the product code to get around this)</li>

  <li>The N82 is actually slower shot to shot than the N95 when the sensor powers down. My theory is that the Xeon flash powers up for pre-flash/pre-focus and that takes time and this time is not needed in the N95</li>

  <li>The built-in GPS seemed faster than the N95 but not much faster perhaps if I had the European variant which has had more firmware updates.</li>

  <li>The keys are too small. Like Whatley Dude I prefer the N95's keys.</li>

  <li>Sports Tracker *seemed* less reliable. <a href="http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2008/10/the_nokia_n96_face_the_task.html">Again</a> this may be a firmware issue</li>
</ol>
<p>Back to the N95-1 tomorrow! But my power cameraphone recommendation of choice for Canadians and Americans remains the N95-4 aka N95 8GB NAM (and if you have lots of money, the gorgeous sounding N85 which also does North American 3G). For a power user of cameraphones, life is too short for EDGE!</p><br />

The Wall Street Journal also thinks the Motorola RAZR line (which includes the KRZR K1) is behind in technology.

My free advice to Motorola: it's not just the package, it's also the software and most importantly the entire experience which consists of the hardware, software and the packaging. Learn from Apple and Nokia or you are doomed. People are not going to be content with a beautiful phone with yesterday's software which allows you take decent photo and videos but has  no  easy way to share them.

<strong>QUOTE</strong>
</p><blockquote>
A year ago, Motorola Inc. appeared headed for a third straight year of rich profits under Chief Executive Ed Zander, driven by its hit cellphone the Razr. "A lot of you are always asking what is after the Razr," Mr. Zander said in an April 2006 conference call after another quarter of 30%-plus growth. "I say more Razrs."
<br />
<br />But behind the scenes, Motorola was working furiously to get a successor phone to market by the second half of 2006, according to people familiar with the matter. When it failed to do so, profit margins on handsets narrowed and the company swung to a loss. Key executives left. And as the stock slid, activist investor Carl Icahn built up a position and began campaigning for a board seat to address what he called Motorola's "operational problems."
<br />
<br />Motorola's travails illustrate the risks for a company that rides high with a big consumer hit. Amid its success with the Razr, it fell behind on developing a phone with the next generation of technology. Missing a beat is especially hazardous in cellphones, where it can take two to three years to develop a new line.

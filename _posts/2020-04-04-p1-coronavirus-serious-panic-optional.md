* Read the whole thing:[Margo Aaron: Coronavirus Is Serious, But Panic Is Optional](https://www.thatseemsimportant.com/mental-health/headlines-media-panic-pandemic/) but if don't want to :-) here are some great quotes:

  * "Disconnect Yourself From Outrage Culture"

  * "**Put effort into your consumption of information.**

    Don’t assume the numbers, quotes, or experts are correct. Make our Founding  Fathers’ proud by doing what they meant when they said a republic needs a well-informed citizenry: question authority. Don’t take things at face  value. Ask hard questions. **Make your brain do work.**

    I believe, sincerely, that many people behind the crappy headlines are  also afraid. Afraid of losing their jobs or being unable to feed their  kids. Afraid, at the moment, of maybe dying.

    [Making money isn’t evil.](https://www.thatseemsimportant.com/psychology/wealth-and-power/) What’s evil is emotionally exploiting people in order to do it. Which is precisely what these headlines are doing.

    **You can fill your brain with information without feeling terror, panic, worry, or fear.**"

  * "The media has failed in its responsibilities to the public, but you  don’t have to fail in your responsibilities as a citizen. Do not let  fear hijack your brain.

    Coronavirus is serious, but panic, worry, and terror are optional.

    Choose a better option."

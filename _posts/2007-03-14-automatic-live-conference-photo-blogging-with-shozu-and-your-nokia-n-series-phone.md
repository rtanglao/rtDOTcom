A lot of  conferences have free WiFi these days and I have used my N Series phones with WiFi that I received free from Nokia (thanks! In particular the N80i, N91 and  N93) to live photoblog over WiFi to ShoZu and then to flickr at these conferences.

First set up the access point (this assumes that it's an open access point, if not you have to add the password in by hand in the Tools-&gt;Settings App-&gt;Connections which is cumbersome but doable):
</p><ol>
<li>App Key -&gt; Connectivity -&gt; Connection Mgr -&gt; Available WLAN - &gt; Scroll down to the free WiFi for the conference -&gt; Options -&gt; Define Access Point</li>
<li>Define the Conference WiFi access point as usual</li>
</ol><p>
In ShoZu, add the access point: 
</p><ol>
<li>Options-&gt;Transfer Status-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Click on Access Points-&gt; Add the Conference WiFi  access point you just added</li>
</ol><p>

I’ll show you how you can take pictures and skip the steps of uploading. Your Nokia Nseries phone will do all the uploading in the background while you do what’s more important: taking pictures.

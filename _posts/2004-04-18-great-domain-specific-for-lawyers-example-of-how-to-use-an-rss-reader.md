<a href="http://www.ernietheattorney.net/">Ernie</a> nails it.  Need more examples like this for other domains.

From <a href="http://www.ernietheattorney.net/ernie_the_attorney/2004/04/get_your_legal_.html">Ernie The Attorney: Get your legal news quickly &#38; easily with a news reader</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Have you heard the term XML and RSS but not known what people are talking about? Have you heard of 'News Readers' or 'News Aggregators' but not really understood why people were so excited about them? Well, rather than just point you to an article on the topic, I'm going to show you how you can discover the power of News Readers for yourself.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

title: There won't be an email newsletter, NASCAR and other crazy :-) things 
---

tl;dr: No email newsletter (use RSS) for this blog. No NASCAR, just blogging.

## Pontifications

Don't forget [you can always subscribe via RSS](http://rolandtanglao.com/feed.xml) using [News Blur](http://newsblur.com/) or [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/) or other RSS readers.

* I won't have an email newsletter of links.
* I won't have an email newsletter of even more stuff related to this blog.
* No NASCAR social media sharing buttons either :-)
* [No comments](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/09/p1-why-there-are-no-comments-on-this-blog/). You can always tweet at me (@rtanglao) or write a blog post or heck even write me an email (see the footer of the blog for the email address).
* No fancy Medium-like theme.
* No Google or other analytics
* No google sitemap or AMP or other crazy :-) Google foolishness ; my 3 readers know how to find me :-) !
* **However if I ever (never say never it might happen!) have a product or service or consulting to offer I'll probably start a newsletter and do all the crazy things above but definitely on another domain i.e. not rolandtanglao.com**

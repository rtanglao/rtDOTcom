<ul> <li>We use them every day: programmes, designers, etc have them</li> <li>Windows 98 had 9 displays because of Brady Bunch according to Tony</li> <li>bezels and things between provide means of organizing </li> <li>What happens when we have large displays where we didn&#39;t have them before?</li> <li>Large displays can change the way we work with computers and people</li> <li>Shadow Reaching:</li> <li>The computer sees us as 1 eye with a finger, mouse pointer i.e. x-y coordinate, not the rich way we interact with people</li> <li>embody users in large displays</li> <li>we&#39;ve interacted with shadows our entire lives</li> <li>so that can help us</li> <li>use our entire body as interaction mechanism</li> <li>What if we had cameras that can figure out where our hands are (touch and drag demo)</li> <li>Problems: too large, can&#39;t reach etc.</li> <li>So instead, follow shadow around</li> <li>More fluid</li> <li>can also use rendered shadows instead of physical shadows</li> <li>Surface Affordances:</li> <li>what are large displays good for?</li> <li>We do use large displays aka &quot;surfaces&quot;: whiteboards, flip charts, etc</li> <li>Observed teams of engineers using these surfaces</li> <li>Surfaces have to manage info, visibiliity and info-suface coupling</li> <li>management - how easy to group</li> <li>easy on whiteboard</li> <li>not easy to add all info</li> <li>visibility:</li> <li>horizontal vs. vertical</li> <li>what if screen was on table instead of at front of room</li> <li>coupling:</li> <li>how easy is it to manipulate info independent of surface</li> <li>e.g. you can tear flip chart, and move elsewhere, so less coupled than whiteboard info</li> <li>the problem is not how to build but</li> <li>Really understanding useful apps and how can we use them to work together</li> <li>On table top displays, reaching is still a problem</li> <li><br /></li> </ul>

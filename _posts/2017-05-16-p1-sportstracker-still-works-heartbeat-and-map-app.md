title: Sports Tracker still works but it doesn't measure your heartbeat and the watch app doesn't work. watch app + heartbeat + map fitness tracker recommendations?

## Pontifications

* [Sports Tracker](http://www.sports-tracker.com/view_profile/roland) still works but doesn't measure your heartbeat and the watch app hangs i.e. doesn't work.
* Any recommendations for an app that works with the watch and makes a map and measures your heartbeat? The Apple Health app doesn't make a map!

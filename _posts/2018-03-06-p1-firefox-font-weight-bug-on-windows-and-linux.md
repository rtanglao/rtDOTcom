title: "Possible font-weight bug in Windows and Linux?!?"
---

## Pontifications
 
* There appears to be a Firefox on Windows and Linux bug with CSS ```font-weight```
* The following Windows (Linux has the bug too) screenshot shows a ```font-weight``` bug where Firefox on Windows and Linux is not displaying bold text. How to fix? Change ```font-weight``` to 50 from 300. **Editing Linux files or modifying Linux files on Windows is NOT OK should be in bold!** ([this bug was discovered from yesterday's blog post](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/05/p1-do-not-create-change-linux-subsystem-files-from-windows/)).

* The bug doesn't appear in OS X and any other browser on Linux, Android, iOS Windows and Mac as evidenced by this screenshot:

* Can't wait for the Surface Book reviews in October!
* I'll get a Surface Book X in late 2020 or early 2021 for work if it runs Zoom and WSL2 well and the reviews are good (assume printer drivers will work by then). I assume unfortunately that the [Windows 10 AARCH64 Lenovo C630 Yoga](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/10/10/p1-lenovo-arm64-aarch64-c630-yoga-latop-review-great-except-wsl2-zoom-usb-iawriter/) will be orphaned! Hope I am wrong because it's great; just needs software to be fixed!

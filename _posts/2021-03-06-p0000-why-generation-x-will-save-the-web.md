"And maybe, just maybe, the best things standing in their way of their spite and their avarice and their political aspirations are the Gen X fortysomethings who saw something better about the open web, and comprehended what was on their screens in a way that nothing has ever touched them since, and still believe in what the open web can be, and understand where things went wrong, and have an idea of how to put things right, and know how to create and use and fork the tools to make it so, and know the north stars they navigate home by, and have never, ever forgotten them, and who need a little bit of reminding, in chaotic times, of what it was like to telnet into a blank screen which contained the entire world." via @deadsquid aka kev needham on twitter

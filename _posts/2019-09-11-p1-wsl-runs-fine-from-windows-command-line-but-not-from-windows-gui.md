* Thanks to [a suggestion from @benhillis on twitter](https://twitter.com/benhillis/status/1171973767729278976), I found out today  that WSL1 runs fine from cmd.exe, the windows command line, but not from the Windows 10 GUI (tap the Windows key, type 'u' and click on Ubuntu). <-- following up from yesterday's [Windows 10 build 18975 on the Fast Insider Ring on ARM64 Windows 10 Lenovo C630 broke WSL1 and I cannot install WSL2](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/09/10/p1-wsl1-broke-on-arm64-windows10-build18975-cannot-install-wsl2/).

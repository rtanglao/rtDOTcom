title: "Why can't universities be more integrated into the community and distributed like libraries?"
---

## Pontifications

* Went to the [Emily Carr Big Reveal](http://www.ecuad.ca/calendar/save-the-date-join-us-for-our-open-house-events-october-27-28) today.
* Very gothic, very centralized and very fab but it felt very cathedral-ish to me in the best possible way and in all the negative ways too.
* Which begs these questions to me anyways :-):
    * Why can't universities be more integrated into the community and decentralized like public libraries?
        * The libraries have a central branch but then they also have very effective and useful branches in every community.
    * Why not have the 21st century equivalent of [quonset huts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut) in every community, move them around, and/or make them fixed sites with varying stuff and people and students? i.e. mini distributed university "incubators" everywhere. e.g. a hut with  solar cells, power and connectivity that people get scholarships to work at, do art, do science, teach in small tutorial groups, do workshops, etc?

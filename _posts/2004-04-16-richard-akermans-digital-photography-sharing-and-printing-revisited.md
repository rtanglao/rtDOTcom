Prompted by a <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/04/16/richard_akerman_digital_photography_sharing_and_printing#comment71">comment</a> from Richard on <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/04/16/richard_akerman_digital_photography_sharing_and_printing">my last post</a>, I revisited <a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~rakerman/digiphoto.html">his digital photography sharing and printing guide</a> and come to think of it, I was wrong,  I couldn't find anything in his guide  specifically that's out of date with respect to Panther!  My apologies to Richard!  The only thing you might want to add is a mention of <a href="http://www.yellowmug.com/easybatchphoto/">EasyBatchPhoto</a> for Mac OS X which does lossless JPEG rotation.

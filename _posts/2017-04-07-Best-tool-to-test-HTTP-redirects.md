title: What is the best open source tool to test HTTP redirects on 6000 URLs?
---

## Pontifications

* I wrote [my own very crude tool in ruby to test 6000 urls](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/05/how-to-check-6000-redirects-version2-aka-procedural-programming-sucks/).
* What is the best open source tool to test HTTP redirects on 6000 URLs? I'd prefer something that plays nice with Ruby or JS. Something like [gauge](https://getgauge.io/get-started.html)? [Robot Framework?](http://peritus.github.io/robotframework-httplibrary/HttpLibrary.html) [Ruby Jmeter?](https://blog.flood.io/load-testing-a-restful-api-with-ruby-jmeter/)

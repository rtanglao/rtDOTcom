title: "Could you decentralize everything? YES....AND...!"

## Pontifications

* Could you build everything so it's decentralized and verifiable?
* Could we have the people's bandwidth?
* Could we have the people's DNS?
* Could we host the "master" our stuff locally but have it served by other nodes when our "master" nodes goes down?
* I don't see why not. [Again it will be slower](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/07/01/p1-happy-canada-day/) but it's worth it!

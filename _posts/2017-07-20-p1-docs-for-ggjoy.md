## Pontifications
* The minimal docs at [https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggjoy) seem like a fine start
* The [ggjoy vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggjoy/vignettes/introduction.html) and [ggjoy reference manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggjoy/ggjoy.pdf) look like fine place to go next

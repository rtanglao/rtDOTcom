[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 15, 2023 08:19  [Doc Searls Weblog · Is Mastodon a commons?](http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2023/02/08/is-mastodon-a-commons/) <-- Mastodon and the fediverse are both a floatilla and a commons :-) ! --> QUOTE: `You can think of Mastodon as a flotilla of boats of vastly different sizes, whereas Twitter is like being on a cruise ship the size of a continent. Some Mastodon boats might be cruise liners with as many as 50,000 passengers; others are just dinghies with a single occupant! `

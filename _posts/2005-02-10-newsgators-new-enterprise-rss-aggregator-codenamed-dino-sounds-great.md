<p>Cool. Especially the API and not having to use Exchange parts.</p><p>From <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/archive.aspx?post=753">Greg Reinacker's Weblog - NewsGator platform roadmap - where are we going?</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>We do a LOT of enterprise business with our Outlook-based product. As we've been working with these customers, we've learned a lot about their needs and issues for information distribution...and what we've been finding is that a desktop-based product alone is not exactly what they need.  Enter Dino.</p>
 
<p>Dino could be characterized as "NewsGator Enterprise Server", for lack of a better name. Imagine NewsGator Online, picked up and installed on a server behind a corporate firewall. Imagine it also (optionally) connecting with Active Directory and Exchange server. No longer would a system administrator need to go install NewsGator Outlook edition on 3000 desktops; rather, with Dino, they could install a single server, make some configuration choices, and employees will just get "more stuff" somewhere in their Exchange mailbox without having to install anything on their own machines. Outlook; Outlook Web Access; Blackberry; Exchange ActiveSync; all of this is enabled by the Dino/Exchange integration.
</p> 
<p>Not using Exchange? Not a problem. Dino will have a version of NewsGator Online's web-based aggregator (also also mobile edition, email edition, and media center edition). Many potential customers have asked us about an intranet-based aggregation solution, and Dino fills the bill for this as well.
</p> 
<p>And with sophisticated indexing capabilities, and integration points with other enterprise systems, Dino can become a central information distribution point for all kinds of content.  All managed in one place, leveraging organizational structure in Active Directory (if available).
</p> 
<p>Dino of course will have extensive API support, to help customers and partners integrate it into their business systems. Some of these API's will be unique to Dino, but the NewsGator Online API's will be supported on Dino as well. So what this means is cool applications that are written to talk to NewsGator Online can also work inside the firewall against the Dino platform. Good stuff.</p>
 
<p>I could go on and on for pages on this - there is SO much cool stuff going into this product.  We've spoken with a few customers about Dino, and everyone we've talked to has been excited about it. Which makes me excited about it!</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jul 7, 2024 17:32 [The advent of robotic hall monitors - lcamtuf’s thing](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-next-frontier-for-llms-hall-monitors) <-- I 'd rather have a human monitor who gets $USD50K per year plus counselling including career development and rotation to a new role after a year, full benefits and 5 weeks of holiday! Seriously!!!! --> **QUOTE**: `With the advent of modern LLMs, this balance is about to shift. The language models are precise enough, and mimic our understanding of text and images well enough, that they can outperform a contract worker adjudicating their 1,000th report — and they can do this while tirelessly checking every nook and cranny of the service in real time. Further, the accuracy of the models might be good enough to build a closed system where an LLM is the judge, jury, and the executioner — eliminating once and for all any concerns associated with human workers peeking at users’ messages. Heck, such a robotic hallway monitor could be even baked into an end-to-end-encrypted chat if it gets European regulators off your back.`

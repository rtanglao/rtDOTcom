* Another amazing tutorial from Nathan Yau and Flowing Data: [January 15, 2019 How to make Animated GIF Heatmaps in R](https://flowingdata.com/2019/01/15/how-to-make-animated-gif-heatmaps-in-r/)
* Bonus: [2012 Calendar Heatmaps to visualize time series data tutorial in Base R](https://flowingdata.com/2012/03/15/calendar-heatmaps-to-visualize-time-series-data/)
* I prefer ggplot2 and tidyverse to Base R, so I'll look for time series in ggplot2 as well of course!

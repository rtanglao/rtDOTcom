## Pontifications

[**UPDATE**: Here's a link to [Jennifer Selby-Long's Video: Working Across Personality Types: The Introvert-Extrovert Survival Guide, with Jennifer Selby-Long](https://air.mozilla.org/july-speaker-series-working-across-personality-types-2017-07-20/)]

My not so great notes but some great food for thought and steps that we can all apply and of course note that it's not a binary world we live in more grey than black or white :-) Everybody is both introverted and extraverted at times!

### if you prefer introversion, here's how to deal with extraverts:

* communicate voice to voice (hard with timezones)
* listen very closely to the last sentence!
* signal that you're engaged in the conversation
* let the pace of conversation be quick if appropriate
* if you need to process SAY SO :-)

### virtual meetings HOW TO

* post as much as you can in advance
* pause
* ask specific team members for their perspectives
* actively solicit ideas that bubble up after meeting
* split more complex decisions into 2+ meetings
* plan for setbacks as  you improve team dynamics

### if you prefer extraversion, here's how to deal with introverts

* communicate first in writing whenever possible even if it's just on
slack 10 minutes before
* listen very closely to the first sentence
* wait during their pauses - don't fill in the quiet space with more
words [roland] - omg this is so difficult for me!
* ask how long people would love to think about a decision or a topic
* circle back after conversations to learn their thoughts (10 minutes
up to 2 days)

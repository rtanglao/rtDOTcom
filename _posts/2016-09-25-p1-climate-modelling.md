title: Personal Climate Modelling

## Pontifications
As always inspired by Bret Victor. This time by [What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/)

* I have always been intrigued by micro climate. 
* Modelling the local climate is something that nobody does it seems to me. And we live at the top of a hill in East Vancouver so we get a wee bit more precipitation than the rest of Vancouver.
* Is there a citizen science movement around local climate modelling that I can tap into and learn from and contribute to?

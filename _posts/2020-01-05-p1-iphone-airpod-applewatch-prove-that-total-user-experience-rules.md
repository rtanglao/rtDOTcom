* The title says it all :-) Unlike the 2010s where it seemed like it was guys  like Steve Jobs in Silicon Valley (see Om's [Apple & Steve Jobs defined mobile in the 2010s](https://om.co/2020/01/03/apple-steve-jobs-defined-mobile-in-the-2010s/)), it will be diverse folks worldwide in the 2020s. We will have some amazing "total experience" tech with folks from just to give a few examples: India, China, the Philippines, Indonesia and South America and Africa!!!!
* In the 2020s it will continue to be Total User Experience and that will expand to include environmental i.e. the sustainability experience of the computer and its materials pre and post manufacturing and the worker experience (i.e. are all humans involved in manufacturing and retail not just the engineers treated fairly?).

<p>Looking for the competition from the likes of <a href="http://www.bokucom.com/">Adam Curry</a> and <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>.  Will they or <a href="http://odeo.com/">Odeo</a> be the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland">flickr</a> of podcasting?
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/03/odeo_podcast_se.html">MAKE: Blog: ODEO Podcast service</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Evan spoke to the business model. The main opportunities hosting (some free some more robust), publishing (some free some more pro) and enable users to charge for content (Audible sold $19mm worth of downloads last quarter). and lastly advertising (matching shows with advertisers).
</p>
<p>Limited invite only beta coming soon.
</p>
<p>My impression of this- Evan has a great service, I'm really looking forward to using ODEO with our new Make:Audio show in all sorts of interesting ways.

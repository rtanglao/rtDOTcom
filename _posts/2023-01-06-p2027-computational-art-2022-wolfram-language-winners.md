[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 6, 2023 20:27 [Computational Art: 2022 Wolfram Language Winners—Wolfram Blog](https://blog.wolfram.com/2022/06/02/computational-art-2022-wolfram-language-winners/) <--- some excellent stuff complete with code!--> QUOTE: `Last, but certainly not least, our first-place winner! This one was a judge favorite all around. The fourth part in a series of posts (one of which was previously featured on the Wolfram Blog), this piece moves from the computational realm into the physical. Using a casting process, the 3D geometry was turned into a pendant, and as with other creations from this series, gifted to the creator’s family. Combining computational design, metalworking and a story about family and love, this entry not only ticked the boxes for this competitions but was also a heartwarming read.`

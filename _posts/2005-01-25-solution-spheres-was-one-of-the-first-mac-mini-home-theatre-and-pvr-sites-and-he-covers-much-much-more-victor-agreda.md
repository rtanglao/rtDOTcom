<p>Victor Agreda emailed me (thanks!) a comment on my <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/01/25/todays_links">Solution Spheres links post</a> to say that <a href="http://solutionspheres.blogspot.com/">Solution Spheres</a> was one of the first blogs to cover the Mac Mini as PVR and home theatre (less than 6 hours) and he is beginning to cover more than just that.</p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 8, 2026 19:02 (UTC) [ME:: of course Art can just be words :-) Dan Sinker:: Foundational Texts: Jenny Holzer's Truisms](https://dansinker.com/posts/2026-01-31-ft-holzer/) <- QUOTE: "**Art could be just words**. Art could be just at home slapped on a POST NO BILLS wall as it could in a gallery. And art could be angry and blunt and even funny sometimes and it could be unapologetic for being all of those things at once. It was all entirely new for me, something I would grab onto and hold dear for decades. Truisms was, for me, absolutely a bedrock-level foundational text."

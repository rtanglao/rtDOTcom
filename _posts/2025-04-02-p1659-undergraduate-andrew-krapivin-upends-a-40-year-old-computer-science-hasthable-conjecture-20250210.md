### QUOTE

>In this comment, I'm just going to go over the method that they call elastic probing in the paper. The basic idea of this approach is to split the array into sub-arrays of descending size, and only care about two of the sub-arrays at a time. We keep working on the first two sub-arrays until the first is twice as full as the eventual fullness, and then move our window. By doing extra work in early insertions, later insertions are much easier.

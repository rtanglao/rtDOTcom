# Pontifications

* I switched repeatedly! First because I wanted to try Windows 10 on a Microsoft laptop.
* And then back to the Mac because the Surface Book 2 had WiFi problems
* And then to the new refurbished Surface Book 2
* And then back to the Mac because of thread exception issues on the Surface Book 2
* And then back to the Surface Book 2 after re-installing Windows 10
* And the switch is actually quite easy if you don't rely on platform specific stuff but instead rely on Linux/OS X/Posix stuff that you can get on Windows and Mac and Linux today, store everything extra in version control like git and in the cloud like github!

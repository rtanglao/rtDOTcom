title: "Recommendations for a Windows 10 touchscreen work laptop w/16gb RAM, USB-C power?"
---

## Pontifications

* For work, I am seeking recommendations for a Windows 10 touchscreen laptop w/16gb RAM, USB-C power
    * The [Lenovo Yoga](https://www3.lenovo.com/ca/en/laptops/yoga/yoga-900-series/Yoga-920-13-inch/p/80Y70062US) looks good
    * [Razer Blade Stealth](https://www.razerzone.com/ca-en/gaming-laptops/razer-blade-stealth) also looks good
    * Any other recommendations?

The number listed under each symbols is the DECIMAL value. Use DEC2HEX() and HEX2DEC() in Excel to convert between hexidecimal and decimal. This is NOT a comprehensive list of ALL Unicode characters (such as the thousands of symbols used for different languages). I've mainly included math, emoji, dingbats, and other miscellanous symbols so that I could copy/paste the entire set into Excel to see what works within Excel.`

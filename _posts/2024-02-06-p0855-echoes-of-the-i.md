Read the whole thing --> **QUOTE**: `The idea of these things being sentient is a science fiction fantasy. But listen to the people who’ve brought this into the world, sincerely believing it to be some kind of new sentience, and saying “if it crosses a line we made up, we should kill it and everything like it”. Even if they’re right, how could you trust somebody like that with a houseplant, much less an important idea, much less public policy? ... They’re not right, though, and they’re not really scared; they just need you to be. So they can avoid being held to account, so we don’t talk about the real locus of agency in software, and where responsibility for real-world harms should actually reside. To distract us from a more fundamental question, of whether or not software developers should be held accountable, in detail, for the real social and economic failures caused by the software we’ve created.`

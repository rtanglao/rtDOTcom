  to nurture a community - BlogTalk  2.0 Takeaway Part'

Yet another takeaway:

<a href="http://mt.middlebury.edu/middblogs/ganley/bgblogging/">Barbara Ganley</a>'s presentation crystallized something for me.  As long as you have an evangelist (technical or non technical) who has a passion for social software like blogs and wikis and  who's not afraid to nurture its use in a community, the software is good enough.

Not that we don't have a long way to go and many miles to go before social software is truly usable by all, but just to re-affirm that the present generation of tools is "good enough" to make it worth using NOW!

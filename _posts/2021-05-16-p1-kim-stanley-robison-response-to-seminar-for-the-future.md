* It is definitely worth your while to read all 9 essays linked to in yesterday's  post: [Cory Doctorow: Crooked Timber's Ministry for the Future Seminar <-- must read essays on climate change](http://rolandtanglao.com/2021/05/15/p1-crooked-timber-seminar-for-the-future/)
* But if you don't have time at the moment, starting with [Kim Stanley Robinson's Response to the Ministry for the Future Semina](https://crookedtimber.org/2021/05/14/response-7/)r and then reading the 9 linked essays also works :-)

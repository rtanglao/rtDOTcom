title: Merkle computing - something to keep an eye on

## Pontifications

* Not sure I understand any of [Interplanetary Linked Computing: Separating Merkle Computing from Blockchain Computational Courts](https://media.consensys.net/interplanetary-linked-computing-separating-merkle-computing-from-blockchain-computational-courts-1ade201ecf8a) :-)

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>
Blockchain computers introduced Merkle computing. Currently the verification & enforcement are in the same system (blockchains).<br /><br />

On the edges, however, cheaper and more varied Merkle computing could open a much wider, more open, audit-able, shared & verifiable computing substrate.<br /><br />

Exploring more generic and varied Merkle computing with different styles of computational courts could lead to some very interesting, emergent applications.<br /><br />

Itâ€™s exciting.

One important concept in ToC is the bottleneck, the resource that is constraining the process the most. Any attempt to improve the throughput of other resources won’t help your overall throughput since the bottleneck limits the throughput of the whole system. I’ve always been on the lookout for what the bottleneck is for software development on teams. ... And Starr has found it. Programmers work with ideas and then express those ideas in code. They might read some code, understand the idea expressed in the code, modify the idea in their head, and then modify the code to express the new idea. According to Starr, the bottleneck is how long a programmer has the idea loaded in their head. That’s the only time they can really use their skills. If you’re struggling to load it, you loaded the wrong thing, or you are shaving a yak in order to load it, that’s all wasted time.`

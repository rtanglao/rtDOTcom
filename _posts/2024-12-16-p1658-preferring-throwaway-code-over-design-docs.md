[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 16, 2024 16:58 [Me:: Everybody can and should prototype: Simon Willison:: Preferring throwaway code over design docs](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/15/preferring-throwaway-code-over-design-docs/) <-- Agreed and maybe with LLMs so-called "non software developers" (IMHO everybody who can do a pivot table in a spreadsheet and/or complicated spreadsheet formulas is a software developer) can write some crude code and create a very rough prototype (of course no code prototypes are always awesome too) instead of overly verbose specs :-) <-- **QUOTE**: `The thing I love about issue comments (or PR comments) for recording ongoing design decisions is that because they incorporate a timestamp there's no implicit expectation to keep them up to date as the software changes. `

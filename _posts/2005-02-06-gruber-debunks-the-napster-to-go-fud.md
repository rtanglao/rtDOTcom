<p>John, really should work for Apple or they should pay him because he "tells it like it is" and most of the time that is in Apple's favour. (And By the Way, I am still waiting for my T-Shirt :-) !)</p><p>From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/02/magic_8ball_napster">Daring Fireball: Magic 8-Ball Answers Your Questions Regarding the 'Napster To Go' Subscription Service</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Plus, even if subscription-based services take off and become popular -- which I think is a big "if" -- Apple could easily jump right in and launch their own iTunes subscription service, no? They'd just make it simpler, and perhaps even cheaper, than everyone else's, and then Steve Jobs would annoy the hell out of the entire rest of the industry by declaring it a "brand-new" and "innovative" way to listen to music.</p>

Wow, that’s a tough one. I’ve played around with the idea of federating cybersecurity, both in the architecture itself and in governance, to push out influence over policies directly where it belongs. But one of the concepts I bring up in talks is one that we won’t necessarily like: it’s to reduce flexibility and choice in how we develop the most important software. Today we don’t have a manufacturing model of software development; we have a literary model, where everyone gets to make up their own version of what we often already have. Safety is critical for many industries, and you’ll see there that “innovation” is strictly discouraged in favor of what is tried and tested. We may have to go there, at least partially, to reduce risk across the board for humans. `

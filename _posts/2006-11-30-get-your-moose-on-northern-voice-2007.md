The <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">speaker submissions</a> are flowing in (<a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">submit</a> today, the more the better; all you need is a good abstract on a relevant topic), the organizers are meeting, we're updating the website, and  the <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/register">registrations</a> are coming in.  In other words, the sprint to <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice 2007</a> is on!

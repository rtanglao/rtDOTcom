<p><strong>Always available Personal Data + Personal Algorithms = Programs that matter</strong>. Inspired by <a href="http://blog.ascher.ca/2013/03/07/decentralization/">David Ascher's Personal computing in a decentralized world: a hopeful direction</a>. What if you could keep all of your personal data and personal algorithms in two places so that you always had a backup?</p><ol><li>In your home on something cheap and cheerful like a Raspberry Pi AND</li><li>With you at all times in your pocket or on your wrist with a portable use anywhere computer like the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/750308586/stormfly-like-a-pc-on-your-wrist">StormFly</a>.</li></ol><p>What if programming wasn't so hard that you had to learn something so rigid like Pascal (the language of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs">Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs</a>) or C++ or even JavaScript but something approachable and more flexible (e.g. <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch</a>, heck even a more accessible version of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>). I predict that would allow people to use their personal data in all sorts of "helpful in real life" ways we can't even imagine!</p><p>And I don't see why this won't be possible in less than 10 years if not sooner.</p>

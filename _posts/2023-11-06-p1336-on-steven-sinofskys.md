[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 6, 2023 13:36  [Ian Betteridge - On Steven S\*nofsky's post on regulating AI](https://technovia.co.uk/2023/11/05/on-steven-sinofskys.html) --> tl;dr: S\*nofsky is wrong. The unregulated market, so-called "AI" or otherwise won't save us from climate change and other crises and regulations in fact have been super beneficial to markets and society in general. --> **QUOTE**: `There is a myth in Silicon Valley that innovation is somehow an unalloyed good which must always be protected and should never be regulated, lest we stop some world-shaking discovery. It doesn’t take 20 seconds of thinking – or even any understanding of history – to see that’s not true. Yes, experimentation is how we learn, how we discover new things which benefit us all. But there are no spheres of knowledge outside possibly the humanities where that is completely unregulated. If you want to do nuclear research, good look with getting a permit to run your experimental reactor in the middle of a city. If you would like to do experimental chemistry, you’re going to be on the wrong side of the law if you do it in your garage....All of those things “stifle innovation”. All of them are entirely justified. Given the world-changing hype – created by technology business people – around AI, they really should get used to a little stifling too.`

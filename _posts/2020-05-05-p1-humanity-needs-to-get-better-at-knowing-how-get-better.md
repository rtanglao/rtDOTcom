* "In that sense, Progress Studies is closer to medicine than biology: The goal is to treat, not merely to understand." <-- read the whole thing: [Collison and Cowen: We Need a New Science of Progress - Humanity needs to get better at knowing how to get better](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/). <--- I totally agree

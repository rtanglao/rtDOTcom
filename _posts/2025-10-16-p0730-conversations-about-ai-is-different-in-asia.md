## QUOTE

* Read the whole thing: [Elizabeth Tai:: Conversations about AI are different in Asia](https://elizabethtai.com/2025/10/14/conversations-about-ai-is-different-in-asia/)

>In my opinion, since they dumped this tech on our laps, it’s now time to manage this. Whinging about the unfairness of being exposed to tech we didn’t ask for from a country thousands of miles away is not going to get us anywhere, is it?

>We need to ensure that the downsides of AI can be dealt with. For example, are data centers the end all and be all? Can we create less energy dependent, pollution causing AI?

>What I mean is that we need to have productive conversations about AI.

>The danger in Asia is ignoring all these downsides, hyperfocused on the benefits.

>However, I am heartened that China is producing more energy-efficient models. I’m heartened that they are ensuring green energy is a part of its use.

>Personally, I forsee a day where huge data centres are not needed for AI, and everyone has a local LLMs in their computers.

>But to ensure this happens, these conversation need to happen. Rhetoric, moralising, fear-based tactics are unproductive.

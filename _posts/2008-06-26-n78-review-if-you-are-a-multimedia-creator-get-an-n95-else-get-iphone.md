I am spoiled by the iPhone&#39;s ease of use and wonderful application environment and the N95&#39;s wonderful 5 megapixel camera and video! And with the N95 coming down in price, I can&#39;t recommend the N78 (which except for the GPS being faster seems like a downgrade!).</p> <p>DETAILS:</p> <ol>   <li>Pricey at $US 500 for the N78 NAM (NAM = North American 3G version), especially when the the <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3796278&amp;CatId=1809">N95 North American is $469.97</a></li>    <li>Only 3 megapixel camera on the N78 (but it takes <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157605819602688/">great</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157605787633421/">pictures</a> but not greater than the N95!) unlike 5 megapixel camera on N95</li>    <li>Camera is slower to focus (even in fixed focus mode) than N95 which means more blurry photos</li>    <li>N78 Keypad is awful, number keys are fine but the Green and Red Keys are very difficult to hit consistently</li>    <li>S60 3rd Edition FP2, the OS on the N78, has hardly any real improvements. I&#39;d rather have an simplified, easier to use UI than FP2&#39;s eye candy. I&#39;d also rather have a phone that doesn&#39;t reboot like the N78 did on me (could be due to the Nokia Sports Tracker beta I was running but all the S60 phones I have used since 2004 randomly reboot). Please make S60 more stable! </li>    <li>N78 Lanyard/strap clip is cool.</li>    <li>N78 GPS seems faster and better at getting a satellite lock. </li>    <li>Video is only 15fps unlike the 30fps on the N95 (and the difference is noticeable!)</li> </ol><br />

If you like uploading 4 photos at time and don't use flickr then LifeBlog might be OK for you. I uploaded thousands of photos to flickr using LifeBlog on my 7610 and switched to <a href="http://shozu.com/">Shozu</a> which automatically uploads photos and videos and has a resume feature. No silly 4 photo at a time restriction like LifeBlog and no flakey Bluetooth or USB +  Windows only software required.</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>I've been using the Nokia LifeBlog program to upload all my photos from my N90 mobile phone... no that is a camera to my PC. I put my camera down and via bluetooth all the photos are transferred. The cable supplied would be quicker I just don't want to carry it. Sharing the Lifeblog with others has a real wow factor.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

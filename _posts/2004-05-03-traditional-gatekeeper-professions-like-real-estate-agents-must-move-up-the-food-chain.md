<p>This applies to other traditional gatekeeper professions. The internet makes a lot of previously closed information open and available. The trick to survival in this age of more data is moving up the offering customers and clients information (as opposed to merely data) that saves them time and money! From <a href="http://www.doug-miller.net/blog/archive/wineronrealtors.html">Doing Something Different:A Weblog by Doug Miller - Winer on Realtors</a>:</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Real estate agents are no longer the gatekeepers of information concerning what homes are for sale. That information is readily and easily accessible. Information for doing comparative market analysis, assessing the quality of schools, and other community information is also widely available online. Finding, collating, and analyzing that information, however, takes time.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

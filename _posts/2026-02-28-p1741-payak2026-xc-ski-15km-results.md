* [2017 Payak 2017 - 1:25 instead of 1:49 Why? Better skis, better wax, faster track, better snow](https://rolandtanglao.com/2017/02/25/payak-2017-125/)
* 2018 [Payak 2018: 1 hour 40 minutes instead of 1:25, -4 degrees, not as fast, skate skiing uphill technique needs work](https://rolandtanglao.com/2018/02/26/p1-payak-2018-skate-skiing-140/)
* 2019
* 2020 [Payak 2020: 1:40 oops fell 3 times in the first 5km, but mountain view climb was fast because of the klaebo running up hill diagonal stride technique](https://rolandtanglao.com/2020/02/22/p1-payak-2020-slower-because-i-fell-3-times-in-first-5-mountain-view-climb-was-fast-klaebo-rules/)
* 2023 [Payak 2023: 1:28 I thought I was fastest evah but I wasn't. The cold (-8) and unwisely stopping just before the end for a drink (oops) made me slower](https://rolandtanglao.com/2023/03/16/p1-payak-2023/)

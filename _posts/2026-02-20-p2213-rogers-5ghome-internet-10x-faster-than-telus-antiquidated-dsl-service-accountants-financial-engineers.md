title: "Installed Rogers 5G Home Internet Ultimate plan, my upload speed has gone up 1500% (from less than 1Mb/s to 15MB/s or more on Telus's antiquidated DSL service). I want Telus Fiber but not available because accountants (?!?) see linked cosocial.ca thread :-)"

>do you remember fixed wireless access from the 90s and 2000s at Nortel? Neither do I :-) It's 2026 so I have Rogers 5G Home Internet and it's upload speed is 10x my Telus DSL. Apparently, Telus won't turn on their fiber until their accountants tell them to for our 1995 10 unit condo (by 2030?) and I can't have both Shaw and Telus because my condo only has 1 wire (it's supposed to have both by law but reasons?!?!).  So I bought this service on a lark :-) since there's no contract.

> Sounds like it's time to switch to Shaw cable internet which has the same upload speed. I call Telus every year and ask about fiber but I'm fed up waiting for them to turn it on :-) My neighbours in a brand new  4 plex across the street have Telus fiber so it's ready, just need to flip a switch or so I am told by Telus contractors :-) but accountants or something :-)

>I have been told conflicting stories about Telus fiber IRL at Telus's store and also by Filipino :-) call centre agents in the Philippines and by Telus contractors who installed the fiber that goes to all of the newly built residential buildings on my block . Oh brother :-)

> And I am 100% sure that Telus fiber if/when I get it, will be a lot better than Rogers or Shaw or Fixed Wireless Access from Rogers or Fido but I'm fed up waiting :-) and calling yearly. I've called once year since at least 2018 LOL

>@tedmielczarek "fiber to the curb" is our situation not "fiber to the riser" is what i believe what we called it in the Nortel days (I worked there for 13 years!!!)

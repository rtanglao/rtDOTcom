title: "Tested positive for COVID 19 on May 3, tested negative on May 10, 2024, fever for one day, headache and sore throat 4 days, gone after 5"

* Tested positive for COVID 19 on May 3, 2024
* Tested negative for Covid 19 on May 10, 2024 and May 12, 2024
* Fever on day 1 was gone on Day 2
* This time I had headache and sore throat for 4 days and then it was gone
* Pretty sure my 5 vaccinations  prevented it from being worse. Go science go!
* Not sure where I got it but my guess is my dentist (who unlike my other 2 dentists didn't have the expensive air purifiers). If  that’s the case I guess we’ll never know because no contact tracing since 2021 sad face. I certainly don't blame the dentist!

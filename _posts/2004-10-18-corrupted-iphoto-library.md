My iPhoto library is corrupted! Help! Must backup more often!
</p><p>
Serves me right for having over 8,000 photos on one library. Should have split it up sooner.  Anyways, I should be able to recover most of my photos  by following the tips in <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/journey/2004/03/recovering_a_corrupted_iphoto_library">Jay Allen's Recovering a corrupted iPhoto library post</a> and <a href="http://www.xmldatabases.org/WK/blog/1399_iPhoto_4,_it_just_gets_worse.item">Inspirational Technology's iPhoto it just gets worse</a> post.  Unfortunately, currently iPhoto dies when it finishes rebuilding my library.  If anybody has any further clues, please leave a comment, I would be most grateful.

Thank goodness, 99% of them are on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/">barbandroland.com</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/">Flickr</a>.

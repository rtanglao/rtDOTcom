<p>I'm down with <a href="http://beercasting.com/">Greg</a> and and down with Greg making money but Kris raises legitimate questions. Just need a wee bit more transparency and some sort of conversations with the grassroots in my opinion.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/?p=391">Experiencing Technical Difficulties</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the actual BeerCasts turned out really poorly. Not the content, it was great... we did 6 epdisodes on topics like "Who I Would Have Chosen To Be Pope", "Tell Me About Your Secret Dreams", and "Living Up to Daddy's Expecations". We had 20+ people actually podcast and they were really funny and clever. But alas, the mics and levels seemed to be all messed in the new podcasting setup we have and people's voices are barely audible. The music in Subeez was a lot louder than in the past too and I suspected that may be a problem.

<p>In other BeerCasting related news (via Peter), Greg launched his company sparkcasting today. He has a cool new site up and new description of what they do.</p>

<p>... cool text from Greg's site deleted

<p>I can't put my finger on it yet but something here makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm very supportive of Greg and everything he's done to get this to where it is and I support his valient efforts to turn his passions into a business. When I pulled these things together for the Vancouver crowd I wasn't working under the assumption that we were going to morph this project into some sort of new fangled Web 2.0 podcast enabled focus group.
</p>
<p>Are we going to start paying BeerCasters to show up? Are we going to find out how much corporations are willing to pay to "harvest" our conversations? I dunno, I want to hear more about this and what it means for the participants. I want to make sure whatever we do is good for the participants who come out to these events for the fun, the community and the converstation and are skeptical about corporations having an interest in the project. We could always just start VanCasting if we don't like the way it feels. In fact, we could sell them back to SparkCasting if we feel like it or directly to the interested parties.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

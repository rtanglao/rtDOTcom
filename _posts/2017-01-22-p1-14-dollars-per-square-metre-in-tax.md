## Pontifications

The [incomparable Jens von Bergman is at it again](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/12/13/updated-property-tax-data/). He's added a ```time slider``` to his [interactive city of Vancouver tax/square metre map](https://twitter.com/LausterNa/status/809089385865936897). Our 10 unit condo went from $10/square metre in 2006 to $14/square metre in 2017. What about your residence in the city of Vancouver?

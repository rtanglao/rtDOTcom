title: Every citizen should learn computational thinking
---
## Pontifications

* Not how to program in Ruby, PHP, Perl, Julia, R, Lisp, Fortran, etc. etc.
* But instead what computers can and cannot do.
* And how to break problems into sub problems that computers can solve.
* This should involve some sort of computer language but not a procedural or Object Oriented one.
* The closest language to what I am thinking is probably something like [Mathematica's language](https://backchannel.com/how-to-teach-computational-thinking-29e45c8a2664#.yhf57h7i4) (not that I agree with everything written in this article!).

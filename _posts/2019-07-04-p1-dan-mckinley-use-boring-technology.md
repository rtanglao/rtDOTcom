**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

Adding the technology is easy, living with it is hard. These are all the things you have to worry about.<br /><br />

I could brew install a new database right here right now while giving this talk, and start writing some data to it. God help me I could, don’t make me do it. But it’s another matter entirely to run that thing in production at a professional level.<br /><br />

* Does this apply to hobbyist projects?!!??! Hmmm yes and no. I guess this means for me to stick to R, ruby and mongodb unless I move into an area like Machine Learning that is primarily in other tech like Python!

You can't meet everybody at a conference.  Especially a 1 day conference where there are 300 people.  I saw Scott (I love his <a href="http://www.sjl.us/">blog</a> and his <a href="http://www.paymentsnews.com/">payment blog</a>) in then distance (the rooms were not small!) and then I tried to track him down and then he was gone.  I think this was shortly before he left for home after the Making Money session.  Next time Scott!

Doc Searls did a great job teeing up the Making Money session. I especially enjoyed the discussion about nickels and dimes vs. "big money" resulting from blogs. Doc asked a particularly interesting question when he asked how many of the folks in the room were in a new business somehow related to blogs -- my guess of the hands was about 40 percent of the audience in the room. Wow.

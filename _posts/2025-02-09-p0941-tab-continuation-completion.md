>Luckily, we can learn from teams like <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>, and <a href="https://codeium.com/windsurf">Windsurf</a> as they forge the path. If you can tolerate the movie-villain long-podcast guy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4">the Cursor developers gave him a rather interesting interview</a> in October that covered a lot of these issues. Or you can just spend time using these tools from the future, letting it rewire your brain and raise the bar for what you can imagine your own product doing.

## QUOTE
>“The president remained steadfast in his novel interpretation of constitutional law.”
>“Faced with the choice between clinging to the letter of the law and marching to the beat of his own legal drum, the president chose the latter.”
>“The president’s solutions-focused approach to legal roadblocks necessitated thinking outside the constitutional box.”
>“Perhaps unaware that he had sailed beyond the Constitution’s horizons, the president found himself drifting further and further from legal terra firma.”

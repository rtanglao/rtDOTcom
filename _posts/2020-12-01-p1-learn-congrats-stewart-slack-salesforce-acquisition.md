## Tweets about slack's acquisition by Salesforce

* remember in the 2000s when a few folks including myself, yourself and 

  [@bmann](https://twitter.com/bmann) used to go for tacos at that Vancouver restaurant run by a fab Brazilian ? Neither do I :-) Congrats 

  [@stewart](https://twitter.com/stewart)  and the entire slack team! [#](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1333954537615360000)

* when i got laid off by Mozilla in August, I joked to  [@dethe](https://twitter.com/dethe)

   that i would email  [@stewart](https://twitter.com/stewart)

   a kr*zy job application w/no resume attached: "Hey Stewart: It's Roland. I need a job. Hire me :-) Maraming Salamat Po ...Roland"  Perhaps I should have :-) ROFL. JK! happy w/where I landed. [#](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1333978560650899457)

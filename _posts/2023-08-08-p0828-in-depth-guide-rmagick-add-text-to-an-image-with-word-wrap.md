[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Aug 8, 2023 08:28  [In-Depth Guide :: RMagick - Add Text To An Image (With Word Wrap)](https://livefiredev.com/in-depth-guide-rmagick-add-text-to-an-image-with-word-wrap/) <-- i wonder if this works with open type? maybe this will get imagemagick working with all the glyphs of custom fonts like grafista (1600 instead of 300 which pango which due to a bug seems to only do 300 glyphs for Grafista) without needing pango --> `font_path = "../font.ttf"`

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 9, 2022 19:48 [Playing with ActivityPub - macwright.com](https://macwright.com/2022/12/09/activitypub.html) <-- QUOTE: `It isn’t possible to implement ActivityPub without a server and a database. You can’t do it with just a static site.` <-- is this true? Doesn't [snac2](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2) work without using a database?!? What am I missing?

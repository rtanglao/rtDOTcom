## Pontifications

* Surface Book 2 Drivers were re-installed by Hamilton again Monday May 7, 2018 <-- this is getting ridiculous :-) oh well the laptop still works well especially Ubuntu in the Windows Subsystem for Linux
* See [Hamilton uninstalled and re-installed my wifi drivers on May 1, 2018: let's see if this fixes the wifi not working after about 1-2 weeks problem on my surface book 2](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/02/p1-hamilton-uninstalled-my-surface-book2-wifi-drivers-1may2018/) 
* I think rebooting would work better or faster or just as well?!?!?
* I guess Marvell, M*crosoft, somebody, anybody :-)  need to fix this !

This is useful for feeding a codebase into any LLM. ](https://gitingest.com/) <-- super cool but probably not useful for large repos like https://github.com/thunderbird/github-action-thunderbird-aaq which `gitingest` turns into a 37 million token file (I excluded all ruby source code and just included the CSV files of SUMO questions and answers)

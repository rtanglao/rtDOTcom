* Strong opinions should be very loosely held if you are not an expert and beware of those who think they are experts on everything just because they "read it" and or did their "research"

>We argue here that people’s limited knowledge and their misleading intuitive epistemology combine to create 
>an illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). Most people feel they understand the world with far greater detail, coherence,
> and depth than they really do. The illusion for explanatory knowledge–knowledge that involves complex causal patterns—is separate from, and
> additive with, people’s general overconfidence about their knowledge and skills. We therefore propose that knowledge of complex causal relations is
> particularly susceptible to illusions of understanding.

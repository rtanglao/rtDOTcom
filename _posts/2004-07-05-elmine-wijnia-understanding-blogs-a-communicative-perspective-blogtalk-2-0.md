Check out her blog, <a href="http://elmine.wijnia.com/weblog/">Communigations</a>:

Disagree with Mark
- need to continue to research "what" is the medium
Objections
- just sites
-one sided
-just hype
Question - To what extent is comunication possible through blogs?
-use Habermas's qualitiative good communicative PLUS
-VanDijk's aspects from blgos that influence communication
Habermas
- for good comms need communicative symmetry between participants and ideal speech situation
Ideal Speech situation
-equal access to all
-no lies, act truthfully
-no power differences
Can blogs offer a platform for the "ideal speech situation"
-integration of consulation, registration and conversation = blog as a new medium
Communication through blogs
- two or more sided
- asynchronous
-low selectivity (disseminating to everybody)
-low interactivity (compare to chat where interactivity is high)
-stimulus richness is high (potential from videos, etc.)
-information complexity is high
Relating the above to ideal speech
- low selectivity makes dialogue possible (+)
-possibility to interact with everybody on Internet not just bloggers (+)
-No power differences
-- all power with blogger (can distort by deleting comments or deleting posts or changing them)
-- yet there is no power difference between bloggers
-Acting truthfully
--context over time helps determine truthfulness
--photos, videos, etc. can help
Conclusions
- blogs do offer a platform for ideal speech situation
-use blogs as a hub to increase interactivity (i.e. display IM and other channels on blog so people can access them quicker!) which improves judgement truthfulness
-dialogue leads to networking

Another random takeaway.

The next generation of web app "good enough" will incorporate the lessons learned from Gmail: leverage cross browser and cross platform DTHML and JavaScript to create a web app that is more dynamic and responsive and therefore is closer to a native application.

And since most social software is a web app, this is a lesson for those developers.  Don't think this is a profound or new idea but it's been burning in the back of my head since I left Vienna.

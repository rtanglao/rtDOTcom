Al Vermeulen was one of my systems design engineering classmates at the <a href="http://www.uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>!

From <a href="http://java.ittoolbox.com/common/print.asp?i=114311">SEATTLE - Things to know about Al Vermeulen, chief technology officer of Amazon.com:</a>&#160;
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>
 He works in Seattle and lives in Corvallis - Oregon. To bridge the distance, he learned to fly.&#160;

 He co-wrote a book about Java (the computer language, not the drink). At one point, it afforded him some "serious geek cachet."&#160;

 He knows how to harvest tobacco by hand.&#160;

 To his first job interview he wore a wedding suit. He was 34.&#160;

 "I just came in and talked to folks," Vermeulen says of the interview, which led to a job at Corvallis-based Rogue Wave. "They gave me an offer that night at dinner. I think I pushed back a little bit because I heard you're supposed to negotiate these things."&#160;

 Vermeulen, who oversees Amazon's huge technology operations, is something of a linguist. In the mid-1980s, as a doctoral candidate at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, he helped pioneer C++, a widely used computer language.&#160;

 That expertise fit in nicely with Rogue Wave, which sold some of the first reusable building blocks for C++. (Think of Rogue Wave as a seller of ready-made foundations to software builders.)&#160;</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

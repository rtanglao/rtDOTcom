## Pontifications

* Mike Caulfield on computational propaganda in ["Computational Propaganda and Totalitarianism (A Thread)"](https://hapgood.us/2018/02/04/computational-propaganda-and-totalitarianism-a-thread/): "This is Arendt’s propaganda machine, automated."
    * Preach it!
    * In a comment, Mike links to Molly K. [McKew Russian bots and their American allies gamed social media to put a flawed intelligence document atop the political agenda. That should alarm us.](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/04/trump-twitter-russians-release-the-memo-216935) :
which has this juicy nugget:

**QUOTE**

My comment:An unfortunately rare occurrence - a presentation made up of 4 women and only 1 man.  

A presentation from linguistics using linguistic and sociological theory with people from far northern Sweden as "subjects". 

In general, blog conversation is dispersed and so is the presence.

Blogs have a blended presence.

Blog creation is vital in the invention of a shared space.

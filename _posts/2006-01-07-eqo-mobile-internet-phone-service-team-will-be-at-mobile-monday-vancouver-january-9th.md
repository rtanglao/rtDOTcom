<p>Well OK, not the entire team. Just 1 or two of the <a href="http://www.eqo.com/">eqo</a> folks! Maybe we can convince the eqo (formerly known as <a href="http://neltura.com/">neltura</a>) folks to give some more details on their soon to be launched mobile internet phone service at <a href="http://momovan.org/?p=2">Mobile Monday Vancouver</a>. See you Monday January 9th at 6:30p.m. at <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com/index.html">Take 5</a> at <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&amp;q=take+5&amp;near=Vancouver%2C+BC%2C+Canada&amp;btnG=Search">429 Granville</a>.</p>

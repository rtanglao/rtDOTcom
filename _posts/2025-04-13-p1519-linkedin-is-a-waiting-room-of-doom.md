Be valuable. Not human. .... If you’re reading this while doom scrolling, somewhere between your 200th application and your fourth coffee, I’m not going to tell you to keep grinding. ... I’m just going to say:  You’re not alone. You’re not imagining it. And you’re not the problem. This system was built to extract your ambition and sell it back to you in monthly installments. The sooner we stop playing along, the sooner something else becomes possible. ....It's time to wake the zombies.`

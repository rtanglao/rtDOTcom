title: "Cypress Challenge 2022: a few minutes slower than the last 'real' one in 2019 but happy!"
---
* Last Sunday was the Cypress Challenge for 2022. According to the official results I was a 8 minutes slower in 2022 ([1 hour and 9 minutes](https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2022/cypress/view/106)) than 2019 [(1 hour and 15 seconds)]https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2019/cypress/view/173).

* But it was fun (and hot :-) !

* $300K raised for Pancreatic Cancer research!

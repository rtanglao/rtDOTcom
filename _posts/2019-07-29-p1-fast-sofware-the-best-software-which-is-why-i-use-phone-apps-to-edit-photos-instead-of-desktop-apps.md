# Pontifications

* I agree with [craigmod: Fast Software, the Best Software](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/)!
* This is why I use phone apps to edit photos ([Lightroom used to be fast back in 2007](http://rolandtanglao.com/2007/05/14/love-lightroom-hate-photoshop/) but not anymore! and I used it heavily 2007-2016). No import dance and most importantly when I move a slider the photo changes quickly.
* #ymmv of course especially if you make money off of photos! Or are printing very large prints!

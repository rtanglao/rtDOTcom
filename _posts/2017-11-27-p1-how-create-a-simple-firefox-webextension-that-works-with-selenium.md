In this article, I’ll walk through the process of hacking support for Firefox WebExtensions into the Selenium Python client’s FirefoxProfile class. I’ve also put my money where my mouth is and submitted these changes as a pull request on the Selenium repository. This means that hopefully the workaround described in this article will eventually not be necessary. I’ll be sure to update this once that’s the case.

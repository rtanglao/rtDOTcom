## Pontifications

* To follow up on [my computational propaganda post](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/02/07/p1-Mike-Caulfield-Arendt-propaganda-machine-automated-aka-computational-propaganda/)
    * Back in the 1980s, Reading K&R (not knowing there was so much goodness in Forth and Functional programming and other areas of computer science and so much more out there in computing! I read the Byte Forth, Lisp and Smalltalk issues in the Augusts of my youth but didn't really grok how wonderful they were), writing 6502 assembler, and writing C and BASIC I never would have imagined that software would be used for so much evil.
    * Naive sad face :-) and :-(

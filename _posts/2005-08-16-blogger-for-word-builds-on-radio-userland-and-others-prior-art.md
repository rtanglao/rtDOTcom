<p>Cool. <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/categories/radiouserland/2002/04/12.html">Radio Userland had support for blogging from Word back in 2001</a>. Just had fewer features and didn't have the backing of a billion dollar company. The revolution continues. In the future every tool will have blogging (and VoIP like Skype) built in where it makes sense.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://buzz.blogger.com/bloggerforword.html">Blogger: Download Blogger for Word</a> (via email from <a href="http://blog.wirearchy.com/">Jon Husband</a>):</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Now you can use Blogger right within Microsoft&reg; Word. Just download and install the Blogger for Word add-in and a Blogger toolbar will be added to Word allowing you to: Publish to your blog, Save drafts, Edit Posts</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

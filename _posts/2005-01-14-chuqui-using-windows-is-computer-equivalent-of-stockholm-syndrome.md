<p>Laugh out loud. Rock on Chuqui!</p> <p>From <a href="http://www.plaidworks.com/chuqui/blog/001850.html">Teal Sunglasses: No, sorry...</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>So to all of those Mac loyalists out there %u2013 I love your computer. But, from one Mac enthusiast to another, with an open mind and a little bravery, you too could learn something new.</p>

<p>No, Sorry. Just because you've chosen to commute to work on a forklift and have convinced yourself it's okay doesn't mean I'm going to consider giving up my car for it.
</p>
<p>I have, in fact, driven forklifts, and while you CAN commute to work on them if you want to -- I can't understand why you would want to.
</p>
<p>I think this is the computer equivalent of the Stockholm Syndrome, where to keep windows from driving you crazy and throwing the computer off a rooftop, you have to somehow convnice yourself the damn monster is really okay and looking out for your best interests.

This might eliminate the need to run Nokia maps to get ShoZu to put GPS coordinates in photos. Need to try this. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100115/">Cyprien</a> can I borrow that GPS again :-) ?

One last thing to note is that some people may have experienced problems when trying to use apps that require an external bluetooth GPS receiver. Within s60 3rd devices there is an app called Positioning that allows you to enable/disable your GPS methods. My N80 for example, shipped with bluetooth GPS disabled and I wasn’t able to use any navigation apps with my Nokia LD-3W until I enabled it.

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 17, 2022 13:08 [The Distributed Computing Manifesto ¦ All Things Distributed](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html) <-- QUOTE: `Today, I am publishing the Distributed Computing Manifesto, a canonical document from the early days of Amazon that transformed the architecture of Amazon’s ecommerce platform. It highlights the challenges we were facing at the end of the 20th century, and hints at where we were headed.` <-- mind blowing prophetic insights from Werner and the A*azon folks. Not many people can think these thoughts, write them out this wel, and live to see them implemented and go live. So many cancelled projects that are similar to this!

title: "My modest-but-not-easy-and-unencumbered-by-knowledge :-) vision for Thunderbird: Reuse Andrew Sutherland et al's Firefox OS mail client for desktop and mobile, IMAP only"

## Pontifications

* My modest-unencumbered-by-knowledge :-) vision for Thunderbird - Reuse Andrew Sutherland et al's Firefox OS mail client for desktop and mobile, IMAP only and add better searching.
* I don't need add-ons.
* I don't need IRC or any other messaging, just IMAP email. I think POP is something whose day has come and gone.
* [I don't need to locally store gigabytes of emails (that's what Calendars, ToDo lists, CRMs, databases, blogs, wikis, etc are for :-) )](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/27/p1-email-will-fail-in-2018-use-todo-crm-database-wiki-blogs-etc-instead/)
* #ymmv and that's totally fine :-) ! As I said I am unencumbered by knowledge !!!!! 
* Read the Thunderbird vision ([January 2018 Thunderbird vision thread](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/tb-planning/2018-January/005744.html), [February 2018 thread](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/tb-planning/2018-February/005747.html)) of others for more insight.
* Disclaimer: I used to work on Thunderbird support, but I haven't worked on Thunderbird since 2012. I know nothing about the code; I still use Thunderbird daily but I won't be heart broken if/when Thunderbird in its present form ceases to exist; I will just use something else! And like many others I pay Thunderbird a small amount of money to hopefully keep it going and to fund Thunderbird.next whatever that turns out to be!

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 2, 2021.Simon Phipps: [The Rights-Ratchet Model](https://meshedinsights.com/2021/02/02/rights-ratchet/) <-- " have yet to meet a sole-maintainer open source company following this model that demonstrates belief in any open source benefit apart from driving adoption. Once they have enough adoption to pivot, they don’t need any form of contribution apart from revenue. Whether they admit it or not they will abandon any peer community they may have had and instead treat “community” as a synonym for “customer”. Spot them as early as you can if you aren’t just another customer looking for a product."

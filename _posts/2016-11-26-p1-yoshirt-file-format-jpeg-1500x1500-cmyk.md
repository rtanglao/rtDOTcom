## Pontifications

*A bit more about designing...*

**

*There are 2 different spectrums of color, one for things that are
viewed on a screen (RGB) and one for things that are actually printed
into the real world (CMYK). Not every color on the RGB scale is
available on the CMYK scale. When designing on the computer/iPhone you
must make sure you are using colors that are on the CMYK scale. Please
keep this in mind when submitting photos.*

* Very easy! ([official docs for upgrading from jekyll 3 to 4)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/)
* 1. Updated the jekyll gem ```sudo gem update jekyll```
  2. And then changed ```redcarpet``` to ```kramdown``` in [_config.yml](https://github.com/rtanglao/rtDOTcom/commit/e296c834b8bdda4ae06bb0616b8f3ebe2ffaae72)

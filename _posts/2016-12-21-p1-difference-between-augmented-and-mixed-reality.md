## Pontifications

Following on from [yesterday's post about AR and MR](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/20/p1-boris-mann-urls-stanley-park-2005-ar-mr-2016/), there was a twitter convo about the difference between Augmented and Mixed Reality (AR versus MR) and [here's what Boris tweeted](https://twitter.com/bmann/status/811711125486116864):

<blockquote>

@CurtisDuggan in MR, the system “sees” reality & can adjust virtual items. In AR, virtual items are painted on top of reality.

title: "Nick Punt::Mea Culpa::Add a User Interface for admitting mistakes and forgiving those who make mistakes to social media like twitter in order to de-escalate"
---
* "In summary, the Mea Culpa idea involves three changes on Twitter:

  1. **Add the ability to admit a mistake**, which shuts down tweet amplification 

  2. **Add corrections** in the home feeds of those who reacted to it, which helps inform  readers so they may adjust what they feel about the poster and may  become better informed

  3. **Add a way to forgive the poster** for those who reacted, which creates an incentive to admit mistakes in  the future, and helps repair any relationship damage between people" <-- Love this idea from [Nick Punt::De-Escalating Social Media Designing humility and forgiveness into social media products](https://nickpunt.com/blog/deescalating-social-media/)

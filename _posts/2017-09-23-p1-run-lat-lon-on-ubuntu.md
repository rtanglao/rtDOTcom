## Pontifications

* I am going to run  ["Null array error check added to: Ruby version of getting neighbourhood aka woe_name from lat/lon of instagram 2015 data"](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/21/p1-null-array-error-check-ruby-version-of-add-neighbourhood-aka-woename-to-lat-lon-copy/) on the [GPD pocket](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/05/p1-how-to-make-bluetooth-work-gpd-pocket-ubuntu/) since it is going to take days and then I won't have to deal with closing the lid, opening the lid
* Shouldn't be that hard right :-) ? Install ruby, clone [my ig-ggmap github repo](https://github.com/rtanglao/ig-ggmap), create a config file with the flickr api key, done!

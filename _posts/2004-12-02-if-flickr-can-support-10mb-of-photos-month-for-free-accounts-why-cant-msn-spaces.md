<p>Some musings in response to <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/12/02/disk_space_is_not_free_even_for_msn_spaces#comment5153">Mike's comment on my previous post</a>:</p>
Probably because <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> grew organically and slowly since they don't have the installed base and marketing clout of Micr*soft. Which means Flickr didn't have millions of users within days which I guess is what Micr*soft expects. Is that about right, <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/mike/">Mike</a>?  Love to hear about how many customers you planned for, how many you actually get and how you planned and implemented your data center.

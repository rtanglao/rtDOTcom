[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 2, 2022 07:53  [X ONE ¦ ERGO-HealthTech](https://www.ergo-healthtech.com/product-page/x-one) <-- QUOTE:`X ONE is able to kill 99.9% of coronavirus in a few seconds, and also work against other types of bacteria and viruses, such as "influenza", "E. Coli", "MRSA", "S. Typhi", etc.` <--approx $CDN 500 <-- via [this tweet from Thomas Finch](https://twitter.com/FinchTH/status/1576416092041670657): `I bought an X-One 222nm portable light and literally started laughing when I turned it on
It’s a lightbulb and a filter and some other stuff  It shines light and viruses go kaput. Literally that’s all it takes. A lightbulb and a filter and some other stuff` <-- read the twitter thread; this X ONE is not a panacea yet but lights like this along with vaccines, masks and CR boxes and Hepa filters could be a great addition to our defences against COVID

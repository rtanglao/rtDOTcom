title: Android 4.1.2 has Heartbleed fix but it's vulnerable to everything discovered after that right?

## Pontifications

If somebody gave me an Android 4.1.2 phone that's no longer being updated post 4.1.2. it's not a good idea to use it right? Because it's vulnerable to every major exploit discovered after [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed) i.e. every attack after [4.1.2's release October 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history) right?

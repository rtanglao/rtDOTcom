title: "Cory Doctorow: 20 years a blogger aka How Cory blogs"
---
* [20 years a blogger](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd) aka How Cory Doctorow blogs via Dries's [Notes](https://dri.es/notes) (which don't have permalinks?!?)
* Very interesting: tl;dr have a searchable archive of stuff and stuff online that you can link to. You can "McGyver" a complicated system but in the end it's a bunch of searchable archived textual posts :-)
* I would like to put all my twitter links and blog posts, flickr photos and videos and pinboard bookmarks in [Datasette](https://datasette.io/) and then search them that way but until then `grep` and search work :-)

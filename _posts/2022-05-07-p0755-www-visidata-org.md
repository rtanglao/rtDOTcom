[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): May 7, 2022. 07:55 [Visidata](https://www.visidata.org/) <--- QUOTE: `VisiData is an interactive multitool for tabular data. It combines the clarity of a spreadsheet, the efficiency of the terminal, and the power of Python, into a lightweight utility which can handle millions of rows with ease` <-- Maybe use this to convert tab separated to CSV e.g. to convert [Location Data for City of Vancouver pedestrian and bicycling accidents](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dwypx85idqeo4zb/Location_Full%20Data_data.csv?dl=0) to CSV from TSV <-- UPDATE: i used `mlr` instead see: https://gist.github.com/rtanglao/4c613c183f0d749b89c6fbaa10d8ddd0#file-vancouver-accident-location-data-full-data-csv

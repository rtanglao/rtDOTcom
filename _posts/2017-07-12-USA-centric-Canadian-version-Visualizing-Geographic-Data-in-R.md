## Pontifications

* [Visualizing Geographic Data in R](https://medium.com/@NickDoesData/visualizing-geographic-data-in-r-fb2e0f5b59c5) is awesome but USA-centric, anybody got a Canadian version or could help me make a Canadian version? Would be an awesome thing for somebody to "Canadian-ize" all these USA-centric map tools!

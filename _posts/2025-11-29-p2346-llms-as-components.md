LLMs and code interpreters. LLMs and databases. LLMs and browsers. LLMs and SMT solvers. These systems can do things, today, that LLMs alone simply can’t, and will never be able to do. More importantly, they can do things today orders of magnitude more cheaply and quickly than LLMs can, even in the case where they can do the same things.`

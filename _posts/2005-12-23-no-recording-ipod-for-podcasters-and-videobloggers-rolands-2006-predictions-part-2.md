<p>Remember my predictions are worth what you pay for them :-) </p><p>Prediction number 2: Apple will not introduce an iPod with built in recording (and leave it to <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/">3rd party manufacturers</a> which is OK but it would great for podcasters if they had an iPod for podcasters) nor will they introduce anything to record video (on a phone or otherwise). This is one prediction I hope will not come true because I think there is a market for a iPod for podcasters and Apple has the ability to make it a truly easy to use, seamless experience from microphone back to the iPod.</p>

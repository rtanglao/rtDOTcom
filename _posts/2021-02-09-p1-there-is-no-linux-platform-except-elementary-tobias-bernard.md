title: "From 2019: Tobias Bernard: There is no Linux platform - Oh really?"
---
* Discovered Feb 4, 2021 There is no Linux platform [Part 1](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2019/12/04/there-is-no-linux-platform-1/) and [Part 2](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2020/03/25/there-is-no-linux-platform-2/) <-- Except Elementary, really :-) ?!?
  * Even in 2021?
  * Ubuntu is not a platform but Elementary is?!?
  * I am not convinced. 
  * I am also not convinced there is a single  Android platform. There's at least two: S\*msung Android, G\*ogle Android (and then add H\*awei and all the rest! )

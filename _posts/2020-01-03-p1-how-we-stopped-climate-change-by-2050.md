* I hope some of the ideas in NPR: [It's 2050 And This Is How We Stopped Climate Change](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/11/688876374/its-2050-and-this-is-how-we-stopped-climate-change) actually get implemented by 2029.
* e.g. "The Urbanization of Everything" which is happening in Canada with >80% of folks living in cities or the near suburbs

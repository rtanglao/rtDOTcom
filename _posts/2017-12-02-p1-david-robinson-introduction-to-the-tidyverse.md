* Looks great but at [$29/month or $13/year i.e. pay $156 every twelve months for unlimited access](https://www.datacamp.com/pricing) it looks pricey for me :-) #ymmv
* For me paying $20 or $30 on a course I will never finish isn't worthwhile.
* Because I can never find the time to finish an online course, I prefer books or ebooks and for the tidyverse there are lots of great ones luckily:

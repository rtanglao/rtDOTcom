<p>First of many! Soon everything that makes sense to organizations and individuals will be in RSS both internally and externally!
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.globelogger.com/item.php?id=294">Moonwatcher Adoption: Salesforce.com via RSS</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>I've finished the proof of concept I started working on last weekend, and now get new leads from salesforce.com via RSS. That way, I don't have to spend my day with my head buried in salesforce. Instead I'm notified of new leads through a variety of desktop, online, and mobile RSS aggregators</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

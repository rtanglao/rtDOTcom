title: Crazy Thoughts after seeing Rennie's Crazy Wing Sang Collection

## Pontifications

I was inspired by the crazy tall "back" portion of the [Wing Sang](http://renniecollection.org/gallery/wingsang.php) building:

* Imagine a laser cutter cutting patterns onto a giant block of wood
* Imagine if those patterns were programmed by an amazing "artist who does paper and other cuts" like [Rachael Ashe](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/RachaelAshe)
* Imagine if this laser cutter was also running an algorithm to evade a giant robot
* Imagine that the laser cutter would automatically stop cutting once the robot got within 2 cm
* Imagine if that once that happened, the block of wood was burned in a giant bon fire like the ones at crazy Burning Man
* As if :-)

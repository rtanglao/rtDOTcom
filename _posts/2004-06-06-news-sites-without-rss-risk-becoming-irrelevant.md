Yup. if you don't want to get your news site linked to by influential bloggers and don't want the traffic that they will give, by all means don't offer an RSS feed :-) !

From <a href="http://ojr.org/ojr/technology/1086293132.php">OJR article: RSS Feeds Can Build Web Traffic, but Fence Sitters Note Problems</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>But news sites that don't offer even a front-page headline feed in this online universe risk becoming irrelevant not only to bloggers who can drive traffic with a mention of a story but to increasingly savvy news consumers like Miller who want control.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

Read <a href="http://justagwailo.com/2008/10/07/knight">the whole thing from Richard</a> to explore some possible Vancouver applications to the <a href="http://www.newschallenge.org/">Knight News Challenge</a>. And if you couldn't make last night's meetup last night, after the jump I have embedded a <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1332089">cameraphone video recording of </a><a href="http://susanmernit.com/blog/">Susan</a>'s Knight News Challenge presentation below. Susan's a really great speaker (so my video doesn't do her justice) and really articulated the program well and made me want to apply or at least jot some ideas on the <a href="http://barcamp.org/VancouverKnightNewsChallenge">Knight Vancouver wiki page</a>.

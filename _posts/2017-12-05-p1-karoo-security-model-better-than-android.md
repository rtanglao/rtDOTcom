title: "What's the worst that can happen if Karoo's Android 6 gets hacked? Navigation is off? Never trust navigation"

## Pontifications

* Roland's paranoia about Android 6 aka Roland's over-analysis of Karoo part 2 ([Roland's over-analysis of Karoo part 1](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/12/03/p1-karoo-i-want-to-believe-but-i-also-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-bike-computer-every-2-4-years/))
* Based on the work folks response below, the worst that could happen is that you get mis-navigated and/or that the Karoo stops working because of an Android 6 hack that the Karoo folks don't patch. Not a worry because I don't trust navigation computers since I get lost no matter how accurate they are
    * I asked some work folks and here are their edited responses:

"@roland it seems like an AOSP fork, so they could have a solid security/app model that limits enough attack surface.  and really, is that better or worse than whatever the h*ll G*rmin runs on?  :-)<br /><br />

I mean, it’s a cycling computer with pretty finite functionality
<br /><br />
it’s an interesting design, and the idea of a connected GPS without taking my phone on rides is nice"

* All Right! I'll revisit in Christmas 2018 and see how they are doing. 
* I'm more likely to buy the second version of Karoo because they are going to get some things wrong. And then stop supporting the 1st version. 
* I guess no bicycle computer with software and connectivity and apps lasts forever. A simple bike computer that doesn't have connectivity is the only thing that lasts and how long will they last and will they provide the features I want? Probably not.

title: "My Samsung Note 8 received the May and June Android security update on July 6, 2019, when will I get the July update :-) ?!? Thanks Fido"

# Pontifications

* Possible reasons: Fido isn't that big. the number of Samsung Note 8 users on Fido isn't that big.  Blah blah blah :-)
* Android security updates for the Note 8 are NOT clearly separated from carrier customizations! Which they will be with the Google's Project Treble and newer phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Note 9 and 10 methinks?!?
* Previously:  [Maybe Fido is delaying Samsung Note 8 Updates not  Samsung (since Note 8 is on the list of phones that get a monthly  update and the Samsung S10 got an update already)?](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/05/25/p1-maybe-it-is-not-samsung-but-fido-that-is-delaying-note8-monthly-security-updates/)

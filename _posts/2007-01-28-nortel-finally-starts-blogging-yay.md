Glad to see that they finally made the leap to public blogging!  <br />FROM <a href="http://blogs.nortel.com/2007/01/23/introduction-to-my-blog/">John Roese&rsquo;s Blog &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; Introduction to my blog</a>: </p><p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p><blockquote> It is with great pleasure that I begin my official weblog at Nortel. Because it is my first, I thought I&rsquo;d take a bit of space to introduce myself and my philosophy and perspective in general as a way to kick off what I hope will be an on-going dialog related to technology, the telecom industry, Nortel and other assorted items of interest that I hope to share with you through this medium. </blockquote><p> <strong>END QUOTE</strong> </p>

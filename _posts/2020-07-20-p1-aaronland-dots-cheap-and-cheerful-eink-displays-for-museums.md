* As always aaron in [i like dot](https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2020/07/20/dots/#easy)s has something well worth reading!
* e-ink + raspberry pi = amazing displays for museums and many other things! (aaron was part of the early pre-yahoo vancouver flickr crew in 2005 and that's when i met him and i've been following him and the other flickr folks ever since)

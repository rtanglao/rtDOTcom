title: What's the best thing we can do as geeks? Get away from our screens go outdoors and exercise!

## Pontifications

And it doesn't have to be strenuous. A 20-30 minute daily walk or bicycle ride or rollerblade or run or cross-country ski is the best way to get re-energized for our geeky indoor pursuits. The best thing I've done for my career is to ride my bicycle to work and cross-country ski twice a week during winter!

Of course indoor exercise is fine, but as nomads and hunters there's something in our heritage that wants us to be outside more!

## Pontifications
 
* Fixed jekyll default theme ```font-weight``` bug by changing from ```font-weight``` from ```300``` to ```400``` in ```_sass/_base.scss```, still might be a Firefox bug as per [this comment on jekyll ussye 4042](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4042#issuecomment-170397990)
* Still might be a Firefox bug as per my previous blog post [Possible font-weight bug in Windows and Linux?!?](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/06/p1-firefox-font-weight-bug-on-windows-and-linux/). If I can write a test case that doesn't have jekyll in it, then it probably is a bug in Firefox.

title: How could "true" in a JSON file be changed to "!0"?

## Pontifications

Ran into a weird problem today with Lithium where ```true``` was changed to ```!0``` in a JSON file! Anybody know how that could happen? Full details on my [showfor.json github repo](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-showfor.json#march-2-2017).

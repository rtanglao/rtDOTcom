title: "What's your conversational style? Are you a positive cooperative overlapper or interrupter? Can you handle it when others overlap or interrupt you?"

* Inspired by [Anil Dash's tweet](https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1363695752929828872?fbclid=IwAR1JmJlw0k4gwkW6_kb8EZwV7C_GScHknM61iTiyDYiMsjXjGFF53Wszk5c): "Ahhhh omg it feels so validating to hear this has a name! I really struggle with talking over people (I understand many experience this very negatively) but it’s an incredibly difficult pattern to change because it’s literally how I grew up communicating enthusiasm & support.

* I like to think I am a positive cooperative overlapper :-) but sometimes I am not!
* Can I handle it when others do it to me? Hmmm not as much as I think I would like to be able!
* Need to reacquire: [Deborah Tannen's Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/conversational-style-9780195221817?cc=ca&lang=en&) (first published 1984, revised 2005).  I read at least one of [Deborah Tannen](http://www.deborahtannen.com/)'s books in the 90s not sure if it was this one, no pre-COVID and pre-parenthood memory or something :-)  ! I recall her being an excellent writer and explainer of these topics!

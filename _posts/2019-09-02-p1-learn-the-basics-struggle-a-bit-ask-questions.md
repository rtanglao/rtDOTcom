* Eugene Wallingford's blog is so great. Just read it all! [Learn the Basics, Struggle a Bit, Then Ask Questions](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2019-08.html#e2019-08-25T10_00_32.htm) is yet another great post; we all should be doing some of this no matter what our age or stage in life.

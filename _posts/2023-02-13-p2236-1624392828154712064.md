A list for those who write code: 1 of 16" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/svpino/status/1624392828154712064) <-- it's always funny until you lose an eye :-) and/or they charge you $$$$ and or something other catastrophic that's unpredictable. i.e. by all means use ChatGPT but don't be surprised/have a backup plan when the rug pull happens !!!

title: My issues with web apps - victory+react any good with large datasets?
---

* CSS is silly. Can we have something better please ? Futile rhetorical question I know LOL.
* The DOM is a silly abstraction as well. Again rhetorical: can we have something better?
* Having to run a server is silly too. But better than becoming dependent on somebody's silly proprietary cloud "server less" abstractions :-) ! (heroku, aws, azure etc etc etc)
* Finally everything runs slowly especially when you have 100K to 1million data points. R is for all its faults is faster and slurps up and deals with 100K to 1million without fuss.
* I'm not giving up :-). I'm considering writing web app visualizations  using https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/about/ + React. Any good?

<p>Excellent, now make them full text for dead tree subscribers like myself and again make the opinion columns accessible to subscribers instead of nickel and diming us for the bogus <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/insideredition/">INSIDER edition</a> and it will be perfect.</p> <p>From <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/rss/#feedsAvailable">The Globe and Mail: RSS Feeds</a> via <a href="http://davidakin.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2005/3/11/418716.html">David Akin</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>RSS feeds can be used by programs, like RSS readers, to create your own personal news wire. With it, websites like the globeandmail.com keep you informed about the latest news on the site. Each of globeandmail.com's RSS feeds contain ten stories, with headlines, summaries and links to the full story on our website.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

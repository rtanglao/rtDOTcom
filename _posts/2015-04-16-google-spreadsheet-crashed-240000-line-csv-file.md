Google Spreadsheet like [Numbers.app](http://rolandtanglao.com/2015/04/16/numbers-crashed-with-240000-line-csv-file/) also crashed with a [240000 line csv file of the top colours from Vancouver instagram 2014 photos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtanglao/rtgram/gh-pages/IG-VANCOUVER_2014/RENUMBERED/TOP10/TOPCOLOUR/topcolour-ig-vancouver-2014.csv) Double wow!

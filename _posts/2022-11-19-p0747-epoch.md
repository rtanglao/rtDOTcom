[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 19, 2022 07:47 [Time is an illusion, Unix time doubly so...](https://www.netmeister.org/blog/epoch.html) <-- ah yeah the infamous 2038 problem --> QUOTE: `Well, ok then. With a 32-bit time_t, we can then account for roughly 136 years starting in 1970. Except, time_t is a signed 32-bit integer, so we only get 68 years in either direction, leaving us with what you all know as the "Year 2038 Problem" (check progress).`

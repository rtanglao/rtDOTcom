I will show you what I regard as the best method of defishing. It’s a technique that I’ve seen used only a handful of times by other photographers but the results can be great. It’s especially suited for landscape photographs that have a curved horizon but it’s applicable to other types of photography too. I will, of course, be using it with landscape astrophotography. For the processing examples, I will be using Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.`

</p><p>If <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">Identity 2.0</a> were bein' deployed widely, th' New York Times could focus on publishin' cool stuff rather than buildin' their own identity infrastructure fer their subscribers.  It will happen.  Just early days.</p><p>From <a href="http://www.warandpiece.com/blogdirs/002640.html">War and Piece:</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>The NYT Select thin' is a total catastrophe.  Fetch me spyglass!  We have been subscribers t' th' print edition o' th' NYT fer a hundred years.  Fire the cannons, pass the grog! But that paper subscription has no correlation t' a login and password that ye could use t' login t' Times Select.  (Anyone else have th' problem o' a couple household with about 12 email addresses betwixt ye o'er th' years?  Who knows what one we subscribed with, and dinna spare the whip, on a dead man's chest! Besides, we subscribed o'er th' phone, or however it were bein' done back in th' early 90s.  This must be th' case fer a healthy percent o' Times' subscribers!) Have been on th' phone with th' NYT fer 20 minutes who are overloaded with calls o' scallywags similarly frustrated.</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

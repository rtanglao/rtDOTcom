## Pontifications

* After making over a dozen custom zazzle t-shirts from [my flickr and instagram infographics](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=roland&tags=infoviz&sort=date-posted-desc), I finally decided to blog about it so I can find it later (hard to search their website).
* zazzle image sizes are all at [150dpi](https://help.zazzle.com/hc/en-us/articles/219861927-Creating-and-Uploading-Images-to-Zazzle): 
    * 2100x1800 horizontal 
    * 1800x2100 14"x12" vertical 
    * 600x600 pocket 4"x4"
* sRGB, but CMYK is fine!

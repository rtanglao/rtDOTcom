title: My ruby scripts log errors to standard err aka stderr and output to standard output aka stdout
---

## Pontifications
* My ruby scripts [e.g.my instagram scripts](https://github.com/rtanglao/2016-rtgram) log errors to standard err aka stderr and output to standard output aka stdout
* Which allows me to chain things together on OS X and Linux
* And not worry about logging.
* I should probably use some sort of logging package :P

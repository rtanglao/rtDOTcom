title: What kind of API should mobi bikes have?
---
## Pontifications

[Mobi bikes is great](https://www.mobibikes)! Lots of imperfections but far greater than not having it!

* [A month ago ](https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/765207311291813889)I met with the amazing [Jens von Bergmann](https://twitter.com/vb_jens) who is the software developer behind the unofficial mobi bikes API and [unofficial Mobi map](https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/765207311291813889) at the fab [revolver coffee](http://revolvercoffee.ca/home/).
* We chatted about the API and broadly I think we agreed broadly on the following (in no order, I'm sure I forgot stuff!):
    1. A real API is needed not the unofficial one Jens maintains through web scraping.
    2. Would be super nice to have a real-time API (assuming there is a GPS on the bicycles) showing where the bicycles are (of course all personal identifying information would be removed).
    3. Would be great to have an API to get a backup of all of my personal data that Mobi stores. (i.e. where I have been, when, how much it cost, etc etc etc).

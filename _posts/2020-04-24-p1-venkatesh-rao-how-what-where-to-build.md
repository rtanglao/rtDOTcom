* "In which I shamelessly draft off Marc Andreessen’s [It’s Time to Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) essay and suggest an approach to *how*, *what*, and *where* to do the building. I also have a framework I call the builder’s cone to think about it in a useful historical context." <--- Read the whole thing: [Venkatesh Rao: How What and Where to Build](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/how-what-and-where-to-build) 
  *  I don't agree with Marc that government can't build great things but yes it is time to build things that are helpful for ALL of humanity! Venatesh's riff on Marc resonates more than Marc's original essay for me!

I used the Amazon Kindle eBook Bulk Downloader by friend of the site Sam Davis. You will need some Terminal know-how (or the help of a friend who has it). Following Sam’s instructions, I installed bun, ran bun install, added my Amazon username and password to my environment variables via the export command, and then ran bun run start —baseUrl "https://www.amazon.com" since I’m in the United States.` <-- [Sam Davis's Amazon Kindle Bulk Downloader code on github](https://github.com/treetrum/amazon-kindle-bulk-downloader) which requires Linux or macOS terminal knowledge. I assume it works on WSL?!?!

Sam Davis's Amazon Kindle Bulk Downloader does them all at once which if you have 100s or 1000s is a big time saver :-) !

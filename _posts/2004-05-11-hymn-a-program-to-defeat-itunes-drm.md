I agree that DRM and fair use are under attack.  I am not sure that this is the correct response.

From <a href="http://hymn-project.org/">hymn -- Hear Your Music aNywhere</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>The purpose of hymn is to allow you to exercise your  fair-use rights under copyright law. It allows you to free  your iTunes Music Store purchases from their DRM restrictions  with no sound quality loss. These songs can then be played outside of the iTunes environment, even on operating systems not  supported by iTunes. It works on Mac OS X, many unix(-ish)  variants and on Windows.

The Mac OS X version includes a drag-'n'-drop graphical user  interface (GUI). The other platforms have only a command-line  interface (CLI) at this time. Prebuilt binaries are available for  both Mac OS X and Windows, and the source code is available for  all platforms.

"The primary objective of copyright is not to reward  the labor of authors, but [t]o promote the Progress of Science and  useful Arts." "To this end, copyright assures authors the right  to their original expression, but encourages others to build  freely upon the ideas and information conveyed by a work. This  result is neither unfair nor unfortunate. It is the means by which  copyright advances the progress of science and art."
-- US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day  O'Connor

Despite what Justice O'Connor has said, DRM exists. The  purpose of DRM is to circumvent traditional copyright law. The  result of DRM combined with laws that outlaw circumvention of DRM  (such as the DMCA is that  there is no longer protection for fair use.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

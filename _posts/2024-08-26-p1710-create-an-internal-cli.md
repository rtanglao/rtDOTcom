One useful way to capture and preserve institutional knowledge in a dev team is to grow a collection of useful snippets, scripts, or workflows. This is why almost every repo out there has some way to write and run tasks via Makefiles, bash scripts, or language-specific toolings like scripts in package.json for Javascript, or mix tasks for Elixir. ...What about org-wide things, like installing useful tools, generating boilerplate code, or running complex AWS commands that no one remembers? Some companies like Slack and Shopify have their own internal CLI. The modern terminal Warp has a pretty sick feature for documenting and sharing workflows. ...It's quite easy to get started with your very own CLI. Let's create one right now for our hypothetical company Acme Corporation.`

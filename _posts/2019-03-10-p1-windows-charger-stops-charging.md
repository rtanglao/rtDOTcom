* I'm sure I've [overanalyzed](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/07/p1-windows-black-screen-is-a-low-power-screen/) this but I'm going to back to my [Windows Surface Book 2 Charger is broken theory](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/05/p1-known-problem-with-surface-power-adapter/) because Windows Explorer crashed and my battery was at 6% yesterday. Maybe my charger overheats or is defective and stops charging?!?!

title: "Software development isn't easy, adding features is hard with current software technology #brokenRecord"

## Pontifications
 
 [I of course wrote this before on December 17, 2016 :-) [Software is hard and won't be what users want until there is security and real layers and components](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/17/p1-software-is-hard-no-clean-separation-or-componentization/) ]
 
 * For the moment since we for the most part use 1950s technology like Java, C++, etc, software development is [stupid](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/02/16/p1-dumbed-down-excel-or-1950s-r/)  and hard.
 * It's hard to add a feature and not break existing features. (It's easy to add features to a small app where there is only 1 user, the developer; but for something that works for millions of people on millions of computers and phones and tablets it ain't easy to make something usable by normal folks)
 * It's easy for an OS update or some other update in the layers of software below an app to break that app.
 * [The answer of course is true, secure components](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/03/01/p1-themes-like-uis-are-something-users-unfortunately-cant-really-control-without-secure-reliable-components/)  and we might just get there with 21st century software technology like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) .

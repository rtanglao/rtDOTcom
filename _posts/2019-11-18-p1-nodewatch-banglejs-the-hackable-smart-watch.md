* Backed: [Bangle.js: the hackable Smart Watch](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gfw/banglejs-the-hackable-smart-watch) (via [Emma](https://twitter.com/triagegirl/status/1194863036864987137)). It's the same as the nodewatch which was given to 400 nodeconf eu attendees recently. And it's open source!
* It seems to have most  (except WiFi) of what I blogged about previously:  [Someday I'll wear an open source watch running my own software on my wrist perhaps a future version of DSTIKE ESP32 Watch DevKit](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/11/13/p1-someday-i-will-have-open-source-watch-on-my-wrist/)

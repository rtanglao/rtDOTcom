* We are ok here in Vancouver, BC as of today. The only thing that has been hoarded is hand sanitizer; everything else is available in supermarkets; everything is up and running.
* Check out: [Vancouver Coastal Health - Information on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)](http://www.vch.ca/about-us/news/vancouver-coastal-health-statement-on-coronavirus)  for daily updates from Vancouver.

  share it or blog it"

The NMC 2004 <a href="http://www.nmc.net/pdf/NMC%20Conference%20Program.pdf">schedule PDF</a> is driving me crazy.  It is impossible to find anything or bookmark or link to anything and blog about it.  HTML for all its faults and warts allows one to link to it and blog it and share it.  PDF is a dead end, closed format. Please NMC, for future conferences, put the schedule as a series of web pages, one per conference day with anchors to each session and speaker.

<p>Could somebody please recommend a headphone amp (takes "headphone out" of one of our Powerbooks and powers 4 headphones)? We would use this for podcasting and Skype conference calls. <a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=headphone+amp&amp;btnG=Search+Froogle">Froogle recommends a Zalman</a>, but I have no idea what to get. Will report back here on what I purchase and what we find out!</p>

<p>Sounds mighty fishy to me too!
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.corante.com/flackster/archives/2005/06/05/it_gets_worse.php#more">It gets worse: Corante > Flackster ></a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>The CEO (Jesse Tayler) of a company (Netmodular) that develops blogging software (Blogworking) writes a less than entirely coherent pitch for his own product.
</p>
<p>He posts this pitch on an independently-owned, semi-commercial blog site (AlwaysOn) that just happens to run on the software platform developed by his company.
</p>
<p>Neither the author nor the site's owners make any effort to disclose the partisan nature of the pitch.
</p>
<p>After I attack the covert and, in my opinion, clumsily argued pitch at my blog, a commenter (Marc Lefton) leaps to the original author (Jesse Tayler)'s defence.
</p>
<p>Thirty seconds of research reveal that the selfless defender of Mr. Tayler's reputation is also directly connected to both Netmodular and to Jesse Tayler himself. A fairly important point Mr. Lefton neglects to mention.
</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of thing that allows detractors to call the integrity and editorial standards of bloggers into question. As Rick Bruner put it last year, in a short piece about Mazda's ill-advised faux blog:
</p>
<p>"Marketers, please, please get the point: blogs are about building trust, not spinning it."
</p>
'Nuff said.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

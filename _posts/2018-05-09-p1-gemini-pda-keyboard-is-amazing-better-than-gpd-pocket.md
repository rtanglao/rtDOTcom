## Pontifications

* The [Gemini Keyboard PDA](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gemini-pda-android-linux-keyboard-mobile-device--2#/)  keyboard is amazing (and better than the keyboard on the [GPD Pocket](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/25/p1-gpd-pocket-chugging-away-and-retrieving-neighbourhood-names-on-ig-2015-vancouver-lat-long/) !)
* Dream: if Linux runs well (Android 7.1 works fine!) and the GPS works great in Linux, then I can put in a SIM card and re-create [gpsgamelan.py](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/06/p1-pythonista-script-to-get-gps-coordinates-on-ios/)  in a 2018 stylee :-)

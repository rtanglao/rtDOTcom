* My S\*msung Note 8 got the Android 9 Pie Update April 1st ([Google released Android 9 Pie back in August 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Pie); far too long; shouldn't take 6 months in 2019; I hope Android Project Treble reduces this time to at most 1 month for newer S\*msung phones like the Note 9 and S9 and S10!), when will it get the [April 5, 2019 Android security patches](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2019-04-01#framework)? I hope before the end of April 2019 but I'm not holding my breath :-)

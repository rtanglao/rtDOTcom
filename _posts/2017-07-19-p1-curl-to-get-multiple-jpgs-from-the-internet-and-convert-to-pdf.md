## Pontifications
tl;dr: ```curl -O url[1-455].jpg```

* from the department of: [Algorithmic mind/Scripting Mind/mindset to automate annoying things](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/23/p1-every-citizen-should-learn-computational-thinking/) (and see [Spreadsheet developers are "real" developers too](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/26/p1-spreadsheet-developers-are-real-developers-too/) and [Everybody should learn to program enough to solve one simple problem in their real life](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/01/12/p1-everyone-should-learn-how-to-program-enough-to-solve-1-real-world-problem/) too) from [Ton's Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/tonzijlstra/posts/10154814739392957):

"
cURL all those 455 pages as JPG (curl -O url[1-455].jpg ), collate
into 1 file and print as PDF using Mac's Preview. Hey presto, full PDF
on my local drive. Total time: under 3 minutes, less than it would
take to create an account, wait for confirmation and then download
just so they have your e-mail address. (which would be a 1-time
address from me anyway) With time to spare to post the process to FB"

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 15, 2022 06:47 [Over-engineering Secret Santa with Python cryptography and Datasette](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/11/over-engineering-secret-santa/) <-- QUOTE `Something I find interesting about this project is that it demonstrates how a Datasette plugin can be used to provide a full, self-contained app....I think this is a powerful pattern. It’s a neat way to take advantage of the tools I’ve built to help make Datasette easy to deploy—not just on Glitch but on platforms like Fly as well.` <-- glitch is super powerful if you can figure out how to use it :-) (I failed to fully understand my eleventy vancouver restaurant website) and cope with its limitations

title: Square-Mile Street Network Visualization with python and Geoff Boeing's OSMNx
---

## Pontifications

[OSMnx](http://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/) looks super great (I wish it was ruby but I don't mind python of course)! Sounds like I should make a t-shirt from the 1 square mile of Gastown or east van right?

From [geoff boeing's Square-Mile Street Network Visualization](http://geoffboeing.com/2017/01/square-mile-street-network-visualization/):

<blockquote>

"<br />

The heart of Allan Jacobs’ classic book on street-level urban form and design, Great Streets, features dozens of hand-drawn figure-ground diagrams in the style of Nolli maps. Each depicts one square mile of a city’s street network. Drawing these cities at the same scale provides a revealing spatial objectivity in visually comparing their street networks and urban forms.

We can recreate these visualizations automatically with Python and the OSMnx package, which I developed as part of my dissertation. With OSMnx we can download a street network from OpenStreetMap for anywhere in the world in just one line of code. Here are the square-mile diagrams of Portland, San Francisco, Irvine, and Rome created and plotted automatically by OSMnx

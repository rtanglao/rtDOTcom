## Pontifications

* [What Augmented Reality App should I write in 2017 Something not too hard :-) ! I'm just a hobbyist!](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/817442545487593472)
* [Fernando suggested](https://twitter.com/fernandomedran0/status/817466691554709504): "A simple "graffiti " app that registers text/image to a learned image. eg the Vuforia sample app."
* [Pomax suggested](https://twitter.com/TheRealPomax/status/817803464625438721): "something that detects books on your shelf and gives you popup summaries next to them?"
* What do you suggest :-) ?

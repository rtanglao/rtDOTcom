<p>Excellent! I agree RSS is not email! </p><p>From <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/01/how_i_use_feedd.html">Nick Bradbury: How I Use FeedDemon</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Chances are, there are a number of power users like Jeremy who don't like the email metaphor, and quite honestly I'm one of them - I don't use FeedDemon like an email client at all. Instead, I've configured it in a way that lets me scan the headlines from a couple hundred feeds with very little time or effort:

<ul><li>     On the "Reading" page in options, I've enabled the "Mark all news items as read when exiting a channel" and "Mark all news items as read when exiting a channel group" settings so that I never have to manually mark anything as read
</li>   <li>  I've maxmized the browser (F11) so that the news item list is hidden</li>
    <li> I changed the newspaper style to "Expando," which is great for scanning headlines
</li>    <li> Rather than clicking each channel (feed) one-by-one, I use the "Group Newspaper" to view everything that's new in every channel in the active group</li>
   <li>  When I find a link that I want to remember, I drag-and-drop it from the browser to a news bin (did you know you could do that?)</li></ul>

title: Email will fail! Don't depend on it. Archive it by year, convert to wikis, blogs todos, calendar and then delete
---

tl;dr **As I blogged in 2013: [Email will inevitably fail so if you foolishly depend on it, learn to back it up and restore it](http://rolandtanglao.com/2013/02/19/email-will-inevitably-fail-so-if-you-foolishly-depend-on-it-learn-to-back-it-up-and-restore-it/)**
## Pontifications

The following pontifications were prompted by Professor Wallingford's [blog post about  email hierarchy](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2017-01.html#e2017-01-06T16_29_09.htm):

<blockquote>
"I'm also a POP mail guy. For many years, Eudora was my client of choice. A while back, I switched to Mail.app on OS X. In both, I had an elaborate filing system in which research mail was kept in a separate folder from teaching mail, which was kept in a separate folder from personal was kept in a separate folder from .... There were a dozen or so top-level folders, each having sub-folders.

Soon after I became department head a decade or so ago, I began to experience the downsides of this approach as much as the upsides. Some messages wanted to live in two folders, but I had to choose one. Even when the choice was easy, I found myself spending too many minutes each week filing away messages I would likely never think of again."

Don't do what the good professor is doing !!!! Instead:

* [email sucks as I said in 2013 :-) ](http://rolandtanglao.com/2013/02/19/email-will-inevitably-fail-so-if-you-foolishly-depend-on-it-learn-to-back-it-up-and-restore-it/)
* filter it out and archive by year and delete all email older than a year
* before archiving, since [email is where knowledge goes to die (Bill French 2003)](http://rolandtanglao.com/2007/02/08/email-is-the-place-where-knowledge-goes-to-die-boris/), [move it out of email](http://rolandtanglao.com/2013/01/27/email-is-not-an-archival-system-file-system-knowledge-management-system-or-a-to-do-system/):
    * todos-> To Do system
    * appointments/events -> calendar system
    * knowledge of the "garden variety"-> wiki
    * knowledge of the "stream variety" -> blog
    * contacts -> some sort of CRM
    * etc etc

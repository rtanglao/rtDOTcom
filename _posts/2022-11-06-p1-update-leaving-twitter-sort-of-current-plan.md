title: "My 'leaving' Twitter update as if it matters really or anybody cares :-)"
---

Sort of in order :-)

1. <del>Download my twitter archive</del> - DONE!
2. Post my archive as a webpage or webpages and/or SQLite using datasette - DONE although I might make it more user friendly i.e. less unfriendly to non geeks. [CSV](https://github.com/rtanglao/30october2022-twitter-archive/blob/main/05november2022-tweet-delete-tweets.csv), [datasette lite](https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtanglao%2F30october2022-twitter-archive%2Fmain%2F05november2022-tweet-delete-tweets.csv#/data/05november2022-tweet-delete-tweets/2)
3. Delete my tweets - 4000 more to go :-) I used tweetdelete.net to delete over 100Kof them and redact.dev to do 10000 or so and may have to write a script if i can't get those pesky 4000 remaining to delete with tweetdelete.net
4. <del>Lock my account and or make it private</del> - DONE, locked

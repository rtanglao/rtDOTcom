<p>The ongoing Fido (and Rogers) r*poff continues. The math: 0.10/0.15 = 66.67%. In a world where every other form of electronic messaging is decreasing in price, Rogers and Fido continue to raise their messaging prices. Needless to say the knock on effect for businesses and innovation and Canada is a net negative. <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/tags/sms-is-dead">I h*te SMS</a> but it's essential for today's real time business and this is a tax by a member of the Canadian bandwidth oligopoly on businesses and consumers.</p>From <a href="http://www.fido.ca/portal/en/domore/text_options.shtml"><cite>Options you can add</cite></a>:

  <p>U.S. TEXT MESSAGING RATE CHANGE</p>

  <p>Please note that effective July 15, 2008, the rate for sending a text message from Canada to the United States is changing to $0.25 (from $0.15). This change also applies to Text messaging options and certain Value packs, as text messages sent to the United States will no longer be included in the options. Pricing does not include applicable taxes.</p>

Due to a babysitting snafu (which is entirely my fault), I won't be able to make tonight's <a href="http://momovan.org/">Mobile Monday Vancouver</a>! No matter, I am sure they will do fine without me. I hear over 20 are registered. It's free! All you have to is  <a href="https://www.sporg.com/registration?link_type=form&amp;form_id=48713&amp;view_type=windowed">register</a> (the event is on upcoming.org as well but you need to <a href="https://www.sporg.com/registration?link_type=form&amp;form_id=48713&amp;view_type=windowed">register</a>) Could somebody please blog, podcast and videoblog tonight's event for those who can't attend? See you at the next MoMoVan!

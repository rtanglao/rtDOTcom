>But actually though, a 2025 academic study found that a whopping 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures. Imagine how much your projects would improve if 94% of your failures went away! Your life would be better. Your skin would clear. You’d get taller. Or at least you’d have fewer “why does this return a string now?” debugging sessions.

>What Octoverse 2025 says about the rise of typed languages

> Octoverse 2025 confirmed it: TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub, overtaking both Python and JavaScript as of August 2025. TypeScript grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY, Aug ‘25 vs. Aug ‘24) with an estimated 2.6 million developers total. This was driven, in part, by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default (like Astro, Next.js, and Angular). But the report also found correlative evidence that TypeScript’s rise got a boost from AI-assisted development.

>That means AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use. And typed ecosystems are benefiting too, because they help AI slot new code into existing projects without breaking assumptions.

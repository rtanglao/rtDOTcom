Juicy Quote: "*This is a bit of a Straw Man thought  experiment. It suggests that economic collapse might only occur when we  can no longer keep generating more and more cheap energy, rather than  when we realize that the current global mountain of debts can never be  repaid, or that profits cannot possibly increase forever. It is probably a deeply flawed argument, and Iâ€™d love to hear what economists think  about it.*"

## Pontifications
* More fun with "pseudo" :-) sparklines: [use ggplot and remove facet wrap labels](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10547487/remove-facet-wrap-labels-completely)
* Would be cool to do this for 365 days a year of flickr photos per woeid
* Or per average colour
* Or per the 256 web safe colours

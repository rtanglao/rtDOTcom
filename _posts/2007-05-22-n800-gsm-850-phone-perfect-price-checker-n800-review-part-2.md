<p> I misplaced my mouse at <a href="/rt/tags/super-happy-dev-house">Super Happy Dev House</a>. I went shopping for a replacement on Friday and found that the combination of the: <br /> N800 and 850 GSM phone + unlimited data plan = perfect price checker and shopping companion.  </p><p> The 850 means that <strong>unlike</strong> GSM 1900 phones it basically works anywhere except a Faraday shielded bunker :-) ! A bit geeky but it was fun being able to take notes and check out the websites of the mouse I was considering as well as verifying that contrary to the label on the box, the mouse I bought, a Microsoft Wireless Bluetooth Mouse 8000, <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=3655882#post3655882">actually works with Macs</a> (<a href="http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=806">inaccurate MS 8000 mouse review</a> - works fine for me out of the box with latest MS drivers - I luv MS mice; I think this is the 4th I&#39;ve bought with my own money!) !  </p><p> And I guess maybe not so geeky since I didn&#39;t get any second looks and I see &quot;normal&quot; people playing around with their Sony PSPs and Nintendo DS&#39;s all the time these days. </p><p> Mark my words, shopping and checking prices and taking photos and sharing media back and forth about what you are buying with friends while shopping will become just as normal as playing games on mobile devices! </p>

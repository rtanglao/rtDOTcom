Steinert:Pistols, pills, pork and ploughs: the structure oftechnomoral revolutions](http://www.michael-klenk.com/resources/articles/text_inquiry.pdf)  <- QUOTE: `In this article, we broach philosophical inquiry into what we term ‘techno-
moral revolutions’. We understand technomoral revolutions as processes of
large-scale, radical moral change, whereby technology plays a noteworthy
role in bringing the change about. Our contribution is twofold. First, we
extend the scope of previous studies of technomoral change, by analysing
four historical and contemporary candidate cases of technomoral revolu-
tions. Secondly, inspired by these case-studies, we reflect on the structure
of technomoral revolutions. More precisely put, we identify general mechan-
isms by which technology contributes to moral revolutions, and present
analytical and conceptual tools to further this inquiry`

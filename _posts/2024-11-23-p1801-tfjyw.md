[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 23, 2024 18:01 [OSF preprint: Hicks and Hevesi: A Cumulative Culture Theory for Developer Problem-Solving](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tfjyw) <-- **QUOTE**: `We propose that despite a conventional emphasis on individualistic explanations, developersâ€™ problem-solving (and hence, many of the central innovation cycles in software) is better described as a cumulative culture where collective social learning (rather than solitary and isolated genius) plays a key role in the transmission of solutions, the scaffolding of individual productivity, and the overall velocity of innovation.`

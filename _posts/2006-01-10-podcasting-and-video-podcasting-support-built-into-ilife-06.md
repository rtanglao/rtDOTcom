<p>Hmm, I guess I was wrong. It looks like Apple just introduced <a href="http://keynoteuser.liveoakhosting.com/?p=74">podcast recording support into GarageBand</a> and <a href="http://keynoteuser.liveoakhosting.com/?p=73">Video Podcasting aka Videoblog recording support into iMovie</a>. We'll have to wait and see how good the support is but this is great! Go Apple go! Expect M$crosoft to follow in 2007 :-) !</p>

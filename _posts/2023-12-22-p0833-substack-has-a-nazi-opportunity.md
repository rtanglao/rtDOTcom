The fact that S*bstack is engaging in a common form of free-speech puffery offered by platforms doesn’t make it true. ` <-- https://www.rolandmicroblog.com/2021/02/15/february-what-am.html <-- "I don't see any Canadians of Filipino heritage making money" <-- We also knew in 2021 that there were terrible N*zi folks using Substack. Nothing has changed.

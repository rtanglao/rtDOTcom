title: "Gaugeplots using R and ggplot2 look cool, use them for operating system percentages in SUMO questions"
---

## Pontifications

* Gaugeplots from jbedford's [Generating gauge plots in ggplot2](https://pomvlad.blog/2018/05/03/gauges-ggplot2/)
using R and ggplot2 look cool, use them for operating system percentages?
* Or maybe for percent that are solved, not solved?
* Or maybe for percent that are "troubleshootingdetailsmissing", "probablynotafirefoxproblem", "notafirefoxproblem", "unclearquestion"?

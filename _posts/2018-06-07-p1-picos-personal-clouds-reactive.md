## Pontifications
* Love the ideas (personal, privacy by design etc) in Phil Windley's [2015: Reactive Programming with Picos](http://www.windley.com/archives/2015/11/reactive_programming_with_picos.shtml) 
* Is it realistic?
* Can we resist the big companies and centralization of clouds?
* Not sure!
* And of course this is via [Stephen Downes](https://www.downes.ca/post/68188)  and [Doc Searls' What’s wrong with bots is they’re not ours](https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/06/07/bots/)

* `Here is a list of all the various home automation tools and apps I use. Overall, my main goal is to have everything running locally, without  relying on cloud services. This pretty much rules out all products by  Amazon and Google, and many others. It also means sometimes it's more  work to get things running, but it's worth it in the end.` <- From [Home Automation](https://aaronparecki.com/home-automation/)
* Not sure I want to do this with or without the cloud :-) Curmudgeon-ish I know :-)

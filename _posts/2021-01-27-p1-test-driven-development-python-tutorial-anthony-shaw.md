*  [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 17, 2020. [Getting Started With Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/#choosing-a-test-runner) <---- i would like to do Test Driven Development for my tshirt visualizations and in the future for scripting at work (not merely learn :-) !) in Python, Ruby and R . Two year old Python tutorial seems like a fine place to start.

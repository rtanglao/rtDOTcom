## QUOTE:

* Read the whole thing: [Anand Chowdhary:: continuous-claude CLI tool: Running Claude Code in a loop](https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/2025/running-claude-code-in-a-loop) 

>Tools like Dependabot handle dependency updates, but Continuous Claude can also fix post-update breaking changes using release notes. You could run a GitHub Actions workflow every morning that checks for updates and continuously fixes issues until all tests pass.

>Large refactoring tasks become manageable: breaking a monolith into modules, modernizing callbacks to async/await, or updating to new style guidelines. It could perform a series of 20 pull requests over a weekend, each doing part of the refactor with full CI validation. There’s a whole class of tasks that are too mundane for humans but still require attention to avoid breaking the build.

>The model mirrors human development practices. Claude Code handles the grunt work, but humans remain in the loop through familiar mechanisms like PR reviews. Download the CLI from GitHub to get started: AnandChowdhary/continuous-claude

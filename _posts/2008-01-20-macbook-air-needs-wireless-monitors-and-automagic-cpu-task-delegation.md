title: MacBook Air needs wireless monitors and automagic CPU task delegation

<p>I actually want something like the MacBook Air. (which <a href="/archives/2008/01/14/2008-random-predictions">I was wrong about since it was introduced at MacWorld</a>). The current MacBook Air is awesome for frequent travelers who have another more powerful Mac that they can use for CPU intensive tasks when they are not on the road. I am not a frequent traveller so I don&#39;t need the current MacBook Air.</p> <p>What I would like is something that is light and thin that I can carry anywhere and that will allow me to quickly dock with other displays wirelessly (I like having multiple monitors when at the office and home but even I get tired of connecting and disconnecting DVI cables!) and to delegate CPU computing intensive tasks to another Mac on the fly over a really fast network like 4G or WiMax or 802.11n (automatically picking the right one like the iPhone does today with EDGE and 802.11b/g). Basically the MacBookAir plus a &quot;CPU task auto delegation&quot; facility built into the OS as well as seamless wireless monitor connections. Oh and always on i.e. the $USD 3000 Flash option. I am sure this is coming. Just have to be patient.</p>

<p>[Cross posted from <a href="http://photographyhack.com/blog/2006/01/10/adobe-lightroom-beta-doesnt-suck">Photography Hac</a>k] </p><p>Well at least not for JPEGs. Gotta try it with RAW photos next!</p><p>From <a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Labs - Project: Lightroom</a></p> Wow! Well done! I am glad to see Aperture actually has some competition! Vive la difference!:<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Adobe&reg; Lightroom&trade; Beta is the efficient new way for professional photographers to import, select, develop, and showcase large volumes of digital images. So you can spend less time sorting and refining photographs, and more time actually shooting them. Its clean, elegant interface literally steps out of the way and lets you quickly view and work with the images you shot today, as well as the thousands of images that you will shoot over the course of your career. Because no two photographers work alike, Adobe Lightroom adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

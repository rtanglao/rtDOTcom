title: "Firefox on OS X is slower than Firefox on Windows"
---

## Pontifications

* Having switched [temporarily back to OS X from Windows 10](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/18/p1-back-on-the-mac-for-now/), I can say that Firefox on OS X is slower than Firefox on Windows
* Photo software like Lumen for the Light 16 however is faster on OS X! Why? Better graphics frameworks like Core Image?

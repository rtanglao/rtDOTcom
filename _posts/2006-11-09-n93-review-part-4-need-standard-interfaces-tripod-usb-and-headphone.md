<p> The N93 suffers from the the lack of standard hardware interfaces. Forget the POP port! Put a standard tripod jack (I guess I&#39;ll buy the <a href="http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2006/11/nokia_tripod_fo.html">Nokia DT-22  tripod that Darla mentioned</a> assuming I can find it in Canada, fat chance! In the meantime if anybody has a way to mount the N93 so I can shoot talking head videos of myself, please email roland AT rolandtanglao.com or phone 604 729 7924), USB port and a headphone jack in every phone Nokia, please! The POP port belongs to the past. Thanks! End of rant :-) !   </p><p> Finally, I guess I&#39;ll buy a POP Port to Standard headphone jack adapter so I can listen to music on my phone in the car like I used to with the N91! </p>

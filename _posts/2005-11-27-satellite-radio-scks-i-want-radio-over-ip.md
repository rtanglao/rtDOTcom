title: Satellite Radio s*cks - I want Radio over IP
created: 1133147196

<strong>RANT</strong> (inspired by the r*diculous ads everywhere from X* and S*rius who are about to enter the Canadian market): I don't need real time radio (for traffic reports which is all traditional radio is good for) from satellites; AM works just fine (e.g. <a href="http://www.news1130.com/">News 1130 in Vancouver</a>) for that. What I want is for satellites to beam me IP traffic over which I will receive podcasts using the awesome technology of RSS. That's it, that's all! Don't need 800 channels of narrow casted cr*p programmed by somebody else. I am the programmer of my audio! It's my playlist not yours, X* or S*irius or Cl*archannel!

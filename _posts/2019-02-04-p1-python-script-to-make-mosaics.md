* [Photomosaic Image Builder: codebox/mosaic in python](https://github.com/codebox/mosaic). Found via kip, might be useful if I can find an image  of [white, green and tan camo](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/01/28/p1-green-tan-white-camoflage-from-vancouver-flickr-pictures/) to use this with that image.

Wiki soft security
-everybody knows everyone front door left open because you know nobody is going to take anything

Role play!

Decentralists
-anarchy, do what I want
-use open source tools
-everything blooms

Centralists
-make sane decisions, cottage industry is fine  but not for an entire organization
-how do you find things, must have centralized 
-most bang for the buck

Fence sitters
- false choice
-both are good
-centralized provides good structure
-decentralized provides true grass root
-don't have to choose
-distributed communities aggregate to central place

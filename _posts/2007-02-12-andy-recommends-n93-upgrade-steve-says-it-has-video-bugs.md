<p> I *was* venting about my N93 instability issues. The new firmware sounds good except for the <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/4868_The_Nokia_N93_next-gen_firmwar.php">camcorder bug that Steve Litchfield mentions</a>. I&#39;ll wait a couple of more days before upgrading and monitor the experience of others. It sounds like the upgrade is great except for power users of the N93 video camera. </p><p> From <a href="http://n93.bloggercomm.com/2007/02/roland_vents_about_symbian_sof.php">Roland Vents About Symbian Software</a> </p><p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p><blockquote> We tend to not filter pro and con comments so when we saw Roland&#39;s comment we had to bring it to light about some issues with Series 60 Symbian software on the N93.  In many cases we&#39;ve found that the Nokia software updater cures many of the issues.  For the N93 Roland and others with a Nokia N93 they can find the updates here. </blockquote><p> <strong>END QUOTE</strong> </p>

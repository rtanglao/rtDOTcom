<p>I am sure this idea which was inspired by <a href="http://kriskrug.com/">Kris</a> <a href="http://www.staticphotography.com/node/53">winning</a> a <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2004_reviews/hp375.html">HP 375 mobile photo printer</a> at the <a href="http://photos.linux.hp.com/">OSCON HP Photo contest</a> is not new (I am sure <a href="http://gailontheweb.blogspot.com/">Gail</a> has thought of it for sure since she has one of these cool mobile photo printers) but I'll throw it out there for what it's worth:</p>
<ul><li>Announce the party. It costs $5/person to be part of the party (for paper and printer ink).
</li>
<li>1st five to sign up are the "shooters for the party". The rest get to party but not to shoot.</li>
<li>1st five take photos for half an hour somewhere and then meet back at a WiFi cafe with power.</li>
<li>The next half hour the fab five pick their top 5 photos from the half hour shot.
</li><li>Then somebody with a laptop downloads the 25 top photos from the fab five.</li>
<li>Finally the whole party including the fab five pick the top five photos on this laptop.</li>
<li>Then you print out 1 of each of the top five photos for everybody at the party.
</li><li>Much hilarity and fun follows :-) !</li></ul>

## Pontifications

* From the department of nobody tells me anything:-), [Make Vancouver](https://www.makevancouver.com/)'s [Mighty Print](https://www.makevancouver.com/pages/mighty-prints-all-over-tshirt-printing-vancouver-bc) at [$CAN32 for American Apparel Short Sleeve](https://www.makevancouver.com/products/unisex-adult-contrast-american-apparel-mighty-print-t-shirt?variant=21226996229) sounds awesome:

> photos plus we have a growing selection of great
>background graphics you can use and we will help you
>put your message on.
>
>What size of graphics do I need? Mighty Prints
>requires graphics built at at least 12" wide x 16"

* Questions for Make Vancouver:
    * What file format? JPEG, PNG?
    * What color space? CMYK, sRGB?
    * Which is better 3200x2400px or 2400x3200px? Can I make it higher resolution? Can I layer multiple graphics?
* I'll try a custom shirt from [one of my old flickr and instagram infographics](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=roland&tags=infoviz&sort=date-posted-desc) (or I'll make a new one) and let you know in a future blog post fingers crossed!

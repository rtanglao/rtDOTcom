[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 11, 2023 19:02 [Reverse Prompt Voodoo – OUseful.Info, the blog…](https://blog.ouseful.info/2023/01/04/reverse-prompt-voodoo/) <-- "prompt takeovers" and "prompt leaks" oh boy :-) --> QUOTE: `That post also makes an interesting distinction between prompt takeovers and prompt leaks, where a prompt takeover allows the user to persuade the LLM to generate a response that might not be in keeping with what the service providers would like it to generate, which may place the service provider with a degree of reputational risk; and a prompt leak reveals intellectual property in the form of the carefully crafted prompt that is used to frame the service’s response as generated from a standard model.`

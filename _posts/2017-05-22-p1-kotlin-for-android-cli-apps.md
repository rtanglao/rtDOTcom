title: How difficult is it to make Kotlin CLI or UI-less apps for Android?
---

## Pontifications

* I'm always looking for a way to make apps on iOS and Android that are command line and / or GUI-less.
* Perhaps Kotlin fits the bill?
* The [getting started with Kotlin tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html) sounds "easy". Phrase like "fairly simple", "extremely easy" make me LOL. Sure it's easy if you done this 8 million times i.e. tried many many procedural languages, SDKs etc but it's never easy for people if they are new to this crazy "real" programming game. I usually find it easy to get the "Hello World" working but hard to do what I want which is read the sensors like GPS and make graphics which somehow is never part of "Hello World" :-) ! (And I've programmed 10,000 line C applications you think it would be easier for me :-) !

**QUOTE from the [Kotlin tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html)**

<blockquote>

It’s extremely easy to start using Kotlin for Android development. In this tutorial we’ll follow the warming up process with Android Studio.

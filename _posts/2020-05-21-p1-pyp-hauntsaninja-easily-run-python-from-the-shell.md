* **QUOTE** -->   Fascinating little CLI utility which uses some deeply clever AST  introspection to enable little Python one-liners that act as  replacements for all manner of pipe-oriented unix utilities. Took me a  while to understand how it works from the README, but then I looked at  the code and the entire thing is only 380 lines long. Thereâ€™s also a  useful --explain option which outputs the Python source code that it  would execute for a given command. **END QUOTE** <--- Read [Simon Willison's blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2020/May/9/pyp/) and check out [hauntsaninja's pyp](https://github.com/hauntsaninja/pyp) which is "Magical, but never mysterious." <--- Right as if introspection and the AST is never both magical and mysterious :-)

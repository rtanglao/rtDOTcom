[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 30, 2020. [How I Teach R Markdown](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-05-28-how-i-teach-r-markdown/) <--- start here?  netlify drop, what is that ?  ---> "Make it snappy. I aim to get to a shareable link in the first 20 minutes (at most!). I like to use Netlify Drop for this. No account sign-up needed, and everyone knows how to drag-and-drop (see video below). It is very satisfying to get a link they can share with their mom/best friend/arch nemesis (kidding). I like to have everyone drop their links in a chat too, like a Slack, Google Doc, or a Gitter channel if doing a workshop. My favorite motto: “if it knits, it ships”"

AND declarative is better but harder to use if you have an imperative software development background! <--- QUOTE `But if you agree with this statement, you should probably use a declarative design tool:...   CSS is awesome and I want my tools to amplify the way that CSS had been designed....If you agree with the first statement but you then try using a declarative tool like Utopia or Every Layout, you will probably have a bad time. You’ll probably hate it. You may declare the tool to be “bad”....Likewise if you agree with the second statement but you then try using an imperative tool like Tailwind, you will probably have a bad time. You’ll probably hate it. You may declare the tool to be “bad”.`

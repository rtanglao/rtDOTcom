## Pontifications

* For the record :-), Naz re-installed Windows 10 today December 12, 2018 on the [second Surface Book 2](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/19/p1-no-wifi-usb-issues-after-2-weeks/) (which has been crashing with a [system thread exception issue](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/46139281902/) since last Thursday), fingers crossed this fixes the random crashes!

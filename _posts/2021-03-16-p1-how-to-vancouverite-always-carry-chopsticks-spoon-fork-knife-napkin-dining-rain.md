title: "How To Vancouverite in the Rain: Always carry chopsticks, spoon, fork, knife wrapped in a napkin since you never know when you'll have a hankering for adobo, pancit, mapo tofu, kimchi stew, chana masala or sushi"

* Juste pour le fun :-)
* Always carry chopsticks, spoon, fork and knife wrapped in a cloth napkin so you can eat in the rain.
* Seriously it's not that bad, there's always some sort of rain shelter somewhere and if you are wearing appropriate rain gear and your back side is dry courtesy of the plastic bag from the previous post: [How To Vancouverite in the Rain: Always carry a plastic bag for outdoor coffee and doughnuts in the rain](http://rolandtanglao.com/2021/03/15/p1-how-to-vancouverite-always-carry-a-plastic-bag-for-coffee-and-doughnuts-in-the-rain/), it's fun to eat your adobo, pancit, mapo tofu, kimchi stew, chana masala or sushi in the rain! And in COVID times there's the bonus advantage of nobody else doing it :-) !

## Pontifications

* [I'm a 1 issue voter :-) who wants more bicycle lanes especially Commercial Drive where I see many folks on bicycles almost getting hit by cars. so i'm going to vote for Shauna Sylvester and Pete Fry and anybody else 100% in favour of bicycle lane expansion. #ymmv :-)](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1050566785429192704)

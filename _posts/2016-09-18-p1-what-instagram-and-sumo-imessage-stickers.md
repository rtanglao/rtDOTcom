## Pontifications

* You don't need to code to create stickers for iMessage / iOS 10. You can use [Xcode to make stickers](https://developer.apple.com/stickers/).
* Or you can use [3rd party apps](http://bgr.com/2016/09/16/ios-10-how-to-make-stickers/) like [Assembly](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/assembly-graphic-design-for/id1024210402?mt=8) and [Sticker Boost](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sticker-boost/id1150362015?app=messages&mt=8)
* I want to make stickers from [my Instagram Tshirt graphics and other information visualiations](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/infoviz) and for fab work fun from volunteer data from SUMO aka support.mozilla.org.
* What kind of stickers should I make? Hit me up on twitter @rtanglao or email me if you have ideas! I have been particularly fascinated by the [origami animated gif stickers from WWF](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wwf-origami/id1148999697?app=messages&mt=8) and their ilk! Your ideas welcome!

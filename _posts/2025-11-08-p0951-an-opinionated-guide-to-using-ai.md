I don't really want to though LOL ; Ethan Mollick:: October 19, 2025:: An Opinionated Guide to Using AI Right Now](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/an-opinionated-guide-to-using-ai) <-- **QUOTE**: `If you want to use an advanced AI seriously, you’ll need to pay either $20 or around $200 a month, depending on your needs (though companies are now experimenting with other pricing models in some parts of the world). The $20 tier works for the vast majority of people, while the $200 tier is for people with complex technical and coding needs. ... You will want to pick among three systems to spend your $20: Claude from Anthropic, Google’s Gemini, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. With all of the options, you get access to advanced, agentic, and fast models, a voice mode, the ability to see images and documents, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, the ability to create images and video (Claude lacks here, however), and the ability to do Deep Research. They all have different personalities and strengths and weaknesses, but for most people, just selecting the one they like best will suffice. Some people, especially big users of X, might want to consider Grok by Elon Musk’s xAI, which has some of the most powerful AI models and is rapidly adding features, but has not been as transparent about product safety as some of the other companies. Microsoft’s Copilot offers many of the features of ChatGPT and is accessible to users through Windows, but it can be hard to control what models you are using and when. So, for most people, just stick with Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT.`

<p>With all due respect to <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/">Diego</a> (whose <a href="http://p2p.weblogsinc.com/entry/7559113811377656/">clever cactus</a> had some awesome ideas), I don't get <a href="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</a>. Is it <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> lite? Hypercard for webapps?</p> <p>Whatever! I do know the following:</p>
<ul><li>It takes a lot of chutzpah to compare their photo sharing app with <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a>. Sorry, not even close. Please tone down the outrageous marketing comparisons ...or at least add smileys to let us know that you're joking!!</li>
<li>If I was still programming, I'd be wary of hacking on somebody's system where they get my app and the system underneath is not open source (is Ning open source? I couldn't find the license in the FAQ). Instead I'd pay $5-40 a month for my own hosted server and hack in Drupal, Plone, WordPress or some other open source system where I knew the legal status of the system I was using and the code I was writing on top of that system. </li>
<li>I love PHP but it ain't Programming for the People and it ain't Hypercard.</li>
<li>URLs with ampersands, question marks and ".php" in them are so <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/10/04#a993">1999</a> (don't 100% agree with Dave, but ning does appear to suffer from some "featureitis") and totally unnecessary.
</li><li>"the people" will use <a href="http://www.jot.com/">Jot</a> et al  and not program in PHP and not use Ning.</li> </ul>

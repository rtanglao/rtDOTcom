Write View for back links (i.e. not the full AppView and not the Relay) on a raspberry pi](https://bsky.bad-example.com/can-atproto-scale-down/) <-- **QUOTE**: ` a Hard Thing that BlueSky's AppView implementation must do is serve over 31 million users (read load) with best-in-class feedgen. Our self-host dream doesn't involve that. ... Our self-host dream does involve handling the same 31M user write load as Bluesky's, but I think this is where the it's expensive critique gets wires crossed: Bluesky's read load is what's actually expensive. I have a billion links on a happy raspberry pi.`

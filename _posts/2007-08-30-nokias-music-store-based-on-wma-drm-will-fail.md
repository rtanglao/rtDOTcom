<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks for <a href="http://www.womworld.com/nseries/2007/08/31/will-the-nokia-music-store-fail/">the link Nseries WOM World</a>. For the record, I think the Nokia Music store could be successful if they sold non DRM&#39;ed music.&nbsp;</p><p>DRM s*cks! Apple&#39;s Fairplay s*cks! WMA DRM s*cks! The market has spoken and Apple&#39;s DRM has won. WMA DRM is dead and in the long run so is Fairplay (un DRM&#39;ed music is the future!) so launching a music store based on DRM is folly. I want Nokia to be successful but basing a music store in 2007 on Microsoft&#39;s DRM is wrong. Hopefully Nokia will drop the Windows DRM and start selling un DRM&#39;ed music real soon now.</p>From <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/links/2007/08/29/1052">The Tao of Mac - Nokia Launches Music Store and N-Gage on New &#39;Ovi&#39; Portal</a>:  <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   N-Gage and WMA music downloads &ndash; i.e., this has all the signs of being a dud. As I see it, the only thing going for it is PayPal support. </blockquote> <p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

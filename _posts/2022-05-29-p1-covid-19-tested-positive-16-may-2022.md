* Tested positive for COVID 19 on May 16, 2022

* Tested positive for Covid 19 on May 24, 2022

* Tested negative on May 27, 2022

* No fever, just headache and sore throat day 1, headache was gone day 2, sore throat turned into a tickle after 3 days and took a week to go entirely, felt more tired than usual.

* Didn't work for 4.5 working days

* Was isolated at home from May 16-27th. Didn't go out to meet other people or to cafes until May 28th.

* Luckily Barb made me delicious food and we have enough space to easily isolate at home. Super fortunate!

* Pretty sure my 3 vaccinations (2AZ and 1 Pfizer) prevented it from being worse. Go science go!

* Not sure where I got it but my guess is one of the two folks in my bubble were/are an asymptomatic carrier. (and I don't blame them if that's the case which I guess we'll never know).I haven't gone unmasked inside since October.

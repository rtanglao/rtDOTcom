*  [Derek Jones: Evidence-based software engineering: book released](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/11/08/evidence-based-software-engineering-book-released/) <--- complete with R code and data! <--- "This [book](http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/ESEUR.pdf) discusses what is currently known about software engineering, based on an analysis of all the [publicly available data](https://github.com/Derek-Jones/ESEUR-code-data).  This aim is not as ambitious as it sounds, because there is not a great deal of data publicly available."
* Juicy quote (sounds like reading [the whole book](http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/) is very worthwhile! in order to move beyond "anecdata" :-) about software engineering to facts: 
  *  "Is software development shifting from being a sellers market to a buyers market? In a competitive market for development work and staff, paying people to learn from mistakes that have already been made by many others is an unaffordable luxury; an engineering approach, derived from evidence, is a lot more cost-effective than craft development."

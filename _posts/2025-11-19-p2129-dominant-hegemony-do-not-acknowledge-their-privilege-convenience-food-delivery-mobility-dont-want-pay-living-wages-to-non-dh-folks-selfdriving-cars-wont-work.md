title: "The Dominant Hegemony (DH) historically & today choose to NOT acknowledge their privilege & value their convenience (for food delivery, mobility etc) over paying non-DH folks a living wage. Cities aren't going away despite pundits and their dreams :-) of  self driving cars (which we don't need and won't work; we already have public transit, trains and buses) and food delivery."

The DH is fine anywhere: suburbia, urban core, etc because everything comes to them & is built for them so it doesn't matter where they live. Since the 1918 pandemic, pundits have been wrongly predicting the demise of cities. Wrong then, wrong now :-)

* [Losing Lena](https://www.losinglena.com/), a short documentary,  is well worth watching! A doc which to use [Maddie Zug](https://maddiezug.com/)'s words: "discusses the exclusion of women from tech through the story of a woman whose Playboy centerfold became the basis of the modern JPEG". I agree with Maddie that we need to stop using the image in classrooms ([Maddie's Washington Post OpEd](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-playboy-centerfold-does-not-belong-in-tj-classrooms/2015/04/24/76e87fa4-e47a-11e4-81ea-0649268f729e_story.html) which is unfortunately paywalled)

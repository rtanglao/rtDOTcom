* "In *Cultural Analytics*, Lev Manovich presents concepts and methods  for computational analysis of cultural data, with a particular focus on  visual media. Drawing on more than a decade of research and projects  from his own lab, Manovich—the founder of the field of cultural  analytics—offers a gentle, nontechnical introduction to selected key  concepts of data science and discusses the ways that our society uses  data and algorithms." < ----- Can't wait for [Lev Manovich's Cultural Analytics](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-analytics) which should be 100% applicable to my hobby of making tshirts and leggings from flickr data

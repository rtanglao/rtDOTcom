Hilarious and unfortunately true!
From <a href="http://enthusiasm.cozy.org/archives/2004/08/cool-idea-now-go-away/">Ascription is an Anathema to any Enthusiasm &raquo; Cool idea!  Now go away.</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>A handful of reasons why, Mr. Entrepreneur, your amazingly cool new innovation isn&#8217;t going to get funding:
<ol><li>Cool demo! Great price point, what a leap forward! Man making stuff like this dependable is really hard work. You probably can&#8217;t see that, having just moved so fast. You know the incumbent is always improving. Sorry, I think we&#8217;ll pass.</li><li>Cool! - oh - It&#8217;s so cool that pretty soon it will be a &#8216;must have&#8217; and the platform vendor will swallow you. No durable business here. Next.
</li><li>Neat! - oh - Sadly your customers are too smart. Even if you get past the damn designers (NIH etc.) you won&#8217;t get by the risk adversion of the project man<li>Your customer&#8217;s too powerful and too slow. They take years to release a new product and they never leave any real money on the table for the component providers.</li><li>Customers would love that! - oh - The channel&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t care. The channel sells by subscription: i.e. they want zero up front cost, sticky features, and value delivered in dribble. You don&#8217;t fit that model; your toast.
</li><li>Ha, that&#8217;s clever. The early adopters will love it. But, I just can&#8217;t see how the late adopters are ever going to see that as anything but added complexity.</li></ol></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

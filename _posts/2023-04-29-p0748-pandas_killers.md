[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Apr 29, 2023 07:48  [Pandas Killers](https://xvzftube.xyz/posts/pandas_killers/) <-- Need to check out q, csvtk and xsv and update my post at: http://rolandtanglao.com/2022/09/21/p1-tools-for-large-csv-files-simon-willison/ --> QUOTE: ` I enjoyed how expressive csvtk is. I also enjoyed that many of the verbs it used were similar to dplyr verbs summary, rename, mutate. I am big into the grammar of tools. I think having a language of sorts that makes sense makes the commands easier to remember. If you think about it, "google-time" takes longer than compute time in most cases. A good grammar keeps the development speed fast. For this reason csvtk gets The Orator award`

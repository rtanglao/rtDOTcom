* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 25, 2022 19:29 [Journalism is a public good. Let the public make it. - Columbia Journalism Review](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/journalism-power-public-good-community-infrastructure.php) <--- everybody can and should be a journalist like everybody can should be a software developer using things like spreadsheets! --> QUOTE: `The people of Rio de Janeiro have developed one of my favorite things: a simple solution to a complex problem. Here, we had a problem of monumental importance, that everyone enjoying the beach that day could understand but no one could have solved on their own. It wasnâ€™t about the tall man playing the lead role, or the first person to start clapping, or the frantic parent. The best response to the crisis of a child lost on a beach is not to ask a few people to mount a search for a parent. It is simply to get more people involved, at a level at which everyone is willing and able to participate; it is to draw power from the crowd, rather than rely on a small group.`

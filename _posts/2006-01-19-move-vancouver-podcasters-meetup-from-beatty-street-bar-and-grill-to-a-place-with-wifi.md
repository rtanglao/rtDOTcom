<p>[Hemmed and hawed about posting this since I probably shouldn't go since I need to prepare for <a href="/rt/archives/2006/01/17/intro-to-blogging-on-bowen-island-this-sat-january-21-2006-at-bics">Bowen Intro to blogging on Saturday</a>!] </p> <p>I say we move it to a place with WiFi since <a href="http://vancouver.wifimug.org/index.cgi?InYaletown">nothing in Yaletown appears to have WiFi and be open past 5:30pm.</a> Say to <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com/locations.html">Take 5</a> (don't believe the website, it's open until 8p.m.) at <a href="http://local.google.ca/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=429+granville+vancouver+bc+canada&amp;btnG=Search">429 Granville</a>? Then we can do some podcasts and upload them live from our iRivers, M Audio Boxes, laptops, etc. courtesy of Take 5's sweet sweet free WiFi! What say you? </p> <p>From <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/41096/">Upcoming.org: Vancouver Podcasters Meetup at Beatty Street Bar and Grill (Friday, February 3, 2006)</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Beatty Street Bar and Grill 765 Beatty Street (Yahoo! Maps, Google Maps) Vancouver, British Columbia ----- DATE CHANGED TO FEB 3 2006 ----- Sorry folks, I'm struck down by a chest infection. You're all still welcome to show up and hang out if you like, but I'll be at the &quot;official&quot; meetup which is now going to be Feb 3.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

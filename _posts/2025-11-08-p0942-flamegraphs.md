* Gotta read the original ACMQ paper: [The Flame Graph](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2927301)

## QUOTE

* Read the whole thing: [Brendan Gregg:: Flame Graphs](https://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html)

>The x-axis shows the stack profile population, sorted alphabetically (it is not the passage of time), and the y-axis shows stack depth, counting from zero at the bottom. Each rectangle represents a stack frame. The wider a frame is is, the more often it was present in the stacks. The top edge shows what is on-CPU, and beneath it is its ancestry. Original flame graphs use random colors to help visually differentiate adjacent frames. Variations include inverting the y-axis (an "icicle graph"), changing the hue to indicate code type, and using a color spectrum to convey an additional dimension.

>Flame graphs are both a static and dynamic visualization. As a static visualization, a flame graph can be saved as an image, included in print (books), and will still convey the "big picture" as only the most frequent frames have enough width for labels. A dynamic visualization allows interactive features to aid navigation and comprehension, including:

>   Mouse hover shows additional frame details in a status bar.
>    Mouse click zooms the visualization horizontally, revealing function names previously elided.
>    Search matches and highlights a given term and shows the "cumulative percentage" of stacks including the search term.

>This visualization is fully explained in my ACMQ article [The Flame Graph](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2927301), also published in Communications of the ACM, Vol. 59 No. 6.

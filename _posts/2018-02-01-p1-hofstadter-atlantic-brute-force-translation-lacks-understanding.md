* Amen! and that day doesn't look like it will happen without a breakthrough. Neural networks and the other brute force techniques won't get us there. Good enough for Go and Chess, not good enough for "C3P0-style" fluency and understanding. 
* I think that breakthrough (quantum computers? ) will come in my lifetime but what do I know :-) ?

title: Why do you write software? I write it because I must.

## Pontifications

* That doesn't mean I'm good at it :-)
* It's liking taking pictures, something I'm compelled to do and something I actually enjoy some of the time.
* I take long pauses in writing software because debugging and all the tedium takes a few months or days to forget :-)
* I do love the end result, I just don't like the journey!
* Got something like that in your life?

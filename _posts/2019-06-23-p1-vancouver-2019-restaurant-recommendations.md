# Pontifications

* Bonus Restaurants added 24June2019: [Minami](https://minamirestaurant.com/) (awesome Sushi, not cheap, close to the office, 20 minute walk?!?); [Sen Paid Thai](http://senpadthai.com/) at Granville Island, love their rice sheet noodles with beef, [The Magnet](https://themagnet.ca/) is a 5 minute walk from the office and has a magnificent beer list and good eats
* Disclaimer: We don't eat out as much as we used to before the kid was born 15 years ago :-) which means there are many many restaurants I've never heard of or eaten at :-) especially in  Richmond and Burnaby!
* I stand by my 2016 recommendations in [24 hours in Vancouver what would you recommend?](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/20/p1-24-hours-in-vancouver/) (Rangoli, Revolver, Meat and Bread, New Town (watch out for the Always Be My Maybe groupies :-) ), Patisserie Lebeau, The Boss, Siegel's Bagels, Phnom Penh, Museum of Vancouver, Beatty Biodiversity Museum, Museum of Anthropology, Strange Fellows microbrew; Aquabus to see Vancouver the water city)
* [Nuba](https://www.nuba.ca/) is kitty corner from the office. It's delicious and GF, vegan, meat and family friendly :-) Everything is my favourite. They also have Turkish coffee :-) which I love but #ymmv
* [Nicli](https://www.niclipizzeria.com/gastown/) is 5 or 10 minute walk! Delicious floppy Neapolitan certified pizza. Vegetarian and meat and small (as in 1 or two kids) family friendly :-)
* [Haru Korean Kitchen](https://www.harukoreankitchen.com/) is 3 doors from the office. Super delicious home style Korean; love this place, I could eat there daily! They have delicious-looking vegetarian (I've never had it but it sure looks tasty) and they are definitely meat and small family friendly :-). My favourite is their kimchi stew.
* [Nemesis](https://www.nemesis.coffee/) has amazing brunch and coffee.
* [Rhinofish](https://www.rhinofishnoodlebar.com/) for Taiwanese beef noodle soup in Chinatown. They have other Taiwanese favourites but don't bother :-) ok bother  because they are delicious but that's my favourite ! They do have vegan but again never tried it  :-)
* Mapo Tofu at [Fat Mao](http://www.fatmaonoodles.com/) (I know it's not 'authentic' but if you are open minded when it comes to your mapo tofu you will love it; I'm a [mapo tofu obsessive](http://vaneats.com/recipes/mains/ma.po.tofu) and love all the many variations worldwide).  Meat friendly, small restaurant, unfortunately only a few vegetarian options.
* [Chambar](https://www.chambar.com/) for a more  expensive but awesome Belgian and Moroccan  meal.
* [Urban Winery /  Postmark Brewing / Belgard Kitchen](http://vancouverurbanwinery.com/) for wine and beer and great food
* And of course the legendary [Alibi](http://www.alibi.ca/) room for beer and food!
* A little further: 
  * Kokoro Tokyo [Mazesoba](http://menyakokoro.com/menu/) (just get the best seller if you've never had "broth less ramen"). They do have vegan! And I bet it's good
  * All the Ramen Places, some of my favourites: [Santouka](http://www.santouka.co.jp/en), [Marutama](https://marutama.ca/), [Motomachi Shokud](https://ryugetsuservices.wixsite.com/motomachi-shokudo)o, there are sooooo many but they are either on Robson or Denman so 15 minutes or more away from the office
  * [Kulinarya on the Drive](http://kulinarya.ca/vancouver/) for Filipino Food (closed Mondays) (skytrain to broadway and commercial; walk 10 minutes north)
  * [Kishimoto](https://www.kishimotorestaurant.com/) on the drive (closed Monday and Tuesday)
  * [Guu Original](https://guu-izakaya.com/menu/#Original) on Thurlow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our wedding night restaurant. Cheap and Cheerful Japanese izakaya (pub food)
  * [Guu Garden](https://guu-izakaya.com/location/#Garden) has a nice quiet vibe! and is not as loud as Guu Original.
* Even further:
  * 47 minute walk to [Anh and Chi](https://anhandchi.com/) for the best Vietnamese all rounder (chicken Pho is what I order; it's all good; many veggie and vegan choices) #3 bus will get you there
  * [Hoi An](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hoi-an-cafe-vancouver) is another amazing Vietnamese restaurant! Food from its namesake town which is hard to find.
  * [Stem Japanese](https://stemjapanese.ca/) in Burnaby, the suburb to the east! I've never been but all my food expert friends love it!
  * [Savio Volpe](http://www.saviovolpe.com/) for Italian in East Vancouver (East Van)
  * [House of Dosas](http://www.houseofdosas-bc.com/) in East Van
  * [Po Kon](http://www.pokongvegetarian.ca/)g (not Bo Kong! Make sure it's "Po Kong" on the south side of the street NOT Bo Kong on the north side of the street) for Vegetarian Dim Sum and dinner! Super delicious and highly recommended.
* Richmond:
  * I know nothing about Richmond but they have amazing Chinese food! The only place I know that is great is [HK BBQ master](https://www.yelp.ca/biz/hk-bbq-master-richmond), some of the world's best Cantonese BBQ. Not veggie friendly. There are many other great Chinese restaurants in Richmond but I never make it there! Ask another person :-) or the internet!
  * And of course the [Richmond night market](https://richmondnightmarket.com/).

Camino is faster and prettier but I still can't use 0.8 and the latest nightly build because still doesn't work with <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/archives/000990.php">ecto</a> (somehow Camino doesn't set the URL so that I have to manually fill in the URL which is unacceptable!).

We believe this version is an excellent replacement for Camino 0.7 in terms of features, performance, and stability.

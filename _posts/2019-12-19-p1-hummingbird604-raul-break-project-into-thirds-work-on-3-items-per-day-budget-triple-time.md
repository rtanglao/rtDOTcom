* "I have also suggested that you can break down projects and get them done by using the Granular Planning and Rule of Threes strategy [http://raulpacheco.org/2016/10/granular-planning-and-the-rule-of-three/](https://t.co/kGBrjPnElL?amp=1) 1) break down any project in thirds 2) work on 3 tasks per day 3) budget 3 times as much times as you thought you needed"<--- From [Raul's tweet](https://twitter.com/raulpacheco/status/1207684787852460038) makes a lot of sense!

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Aug 19, 2023. 17:57 [Running my own LLM ¦ Nelson's log](https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2023/08/16/running-my-own-llm/) <-- I too am interested in running a model (actually multiple models, a photo model of my 500K photos and a support model from the Thunderbird Support KB and Forums) locally and not paying API fees and not sharing my data with companies! --> QUOTE: `But I’m more interested in running the model locally. My example above uses llm-gpt4all, which downloads and runs GPT models downloadable in some standard format. (There’s some 13 models there, most are about 7GB big.) There’s also hosted plugins for Llama, MLC, and Mosaic.`

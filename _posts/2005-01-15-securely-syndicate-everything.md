<p>Amen! Syndication matters. Everybody and every organization will eventually syndicate everything that matters using secure RSS.
</p>
<p>And for the umpteenth time, don't use Bloglines or any other hosted RSS reader for confidential or password protected subscriptions! Use NetNewsWire, NewsGator or FeedDemon for confidential or password protected RSS subscriptions.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/01/i_want_a_pony_s.html#more">43 Folders: I Want a Pony: Snapshots of a Dream Productivity App</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Syndicated everything via secure http - Flickr does a fantastic job of letting you pluck out just the stream of information that you're looking for (threads I've commented on and the Dr. Phil graffiti group are two favorites). I want the same from a productivity app. For example, I want to flag an email with a special tag and then have it generate an expirable Atom/RSS feed to follow the thread and alert me of updates (oooo...maybe via Growl, too?). And I want it secure. That means no passwords in the URL, and no way for Bloglines searchers to accidentally run across my stuff. (Oh, man, is that ever a bomb waiting to explode).</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

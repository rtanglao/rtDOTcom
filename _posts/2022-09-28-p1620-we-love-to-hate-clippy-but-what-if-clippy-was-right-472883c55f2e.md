[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Sep 28, 2022 16:20 [We love to hate Clippy — but what if Clippy was right? ¦ by tash keuneman ¦ Sep, 2022 ¦ UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/we-love-to-hate-clippy-but-what-if-clippy-was-right-472883c55f2e) <- QUOTE `Every time there is a marathon design-thinking session, where the tables are littered with post-its and the smell of sharpies and body odour are in the air, someone will inevitably say “The solution should be like Clippy, but better”.` <-- Think of Clippy as an inspiration as well as a failure :-) !!

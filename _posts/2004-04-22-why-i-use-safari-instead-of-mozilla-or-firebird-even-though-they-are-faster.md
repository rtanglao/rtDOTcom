One reason.  The <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a> Mac OS X service where I can post highlighted text in the browser to my blog only works with Safari and not with Mozilla 1.7 beta or Firebird 0.8 .  As soon as  the ecto service works with Mozilla or Firebird (not holding my breath for this moment), I will switch.

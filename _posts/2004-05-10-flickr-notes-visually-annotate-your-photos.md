Awesome.  Go <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> go! I want this everywhere.  Like on <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a> for example!

From <a href="http://www.flickr.com/news.gne#45">Flickr: News</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>We've released the intitial versions of two cool new features, tags &#8212; which allow you to sort your photos for easy finding &#8212; and notes &#8212; which allow you to annotate regions of photos, pointing out the people, places and things which make up the story.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

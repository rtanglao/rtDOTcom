title: In Hawaii for work so light posting
---

Just like the good ole blogging days a "light posting for X reason" :-) post!

In Hawaii for work (so lucky and privileged!)  but I'm still thinking about part 5 of my blogging about "creatives": affordability and forces attracting and repelling in Vancouver (Part [4](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/03/p1-mark-busse-creative-angst-part-4-what-is-a-creative/), [3](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/02/p1-vancouver-creative-angst-part3-indigenous-inspiration/), [2](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/01/p1-vancouver-creative-angst-part2-affordability/), [1](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/30/p1-vancouver-creative-angst/))

**What should I write about in Part 5**?

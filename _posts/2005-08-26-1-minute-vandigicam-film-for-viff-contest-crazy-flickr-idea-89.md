title: " 1 Minute VanDigiCam Film for VIFF contest - Crazy flickr idea #89"
created: 1125083080

<p>Yet another half baked idea that I have no time to implement so take it, do it and make lots of money just credit me with the idea! And hurry! You only have until September 2 to enter! Here's how this would work:</p>
<ul><li>Create a new flickr group called VanDigiCam 1 Minute Film or something like that.</li>
<li>People submit their photos to the group pool (not all of the photos have to be of the Vancouver International Film Centre, just one!) and give up their rights to the photo for the film (can of course retain the rights for other uses!)
</li><li>Film producer selects the best 500 or photos</li>
<li>Using iMovie and iDVd or equivalent film producer blends (Ken Burns effect, etc) the photos into a 1 minute film with some <a href="http://www.penmachine.com/musicpages/demos.html">cool CC or public domain music</a> (I am looking at you <a href="http://penmachine.com/">Derek Miller</a>!) as a soundtrack, creates a DVD and enters it in the contest.
</li><li>In the unlikely event you win, all people whose photos were selected get to participate using the film that you win.
</li></ul>

title: What should I do with my Jewelbot?
---


## Pontifications

* Got my [Jewelbot](http://www.jewelbots.com/) from [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1345510482/jewelbots-friendship-bracelets-that-teach-girls-to)! Yes!
* Give to a teen?
* More likely I'll write an app and give it to a teen!
* Wouldn't it be cool if I could use all of the features?
    * SMS
    * LEDs
    * Bluetooth
    * Arduino
    * Mesh Network (anybody else have one so I can try this out?)

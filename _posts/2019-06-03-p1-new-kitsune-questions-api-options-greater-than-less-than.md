# Pontifications

* New to me but available since [March in the fix to issue 3481](https://github.com/mozilla/kitsune/issues/3481): New SUMO Kitsune questions API: created and updated less than and greater than. Previously:  [Kitsune Questions aka AAQ API, product == 'firefox' is desktop, 'mobile' is Firefox for android](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/19/p1-kitsune-questions-aaq-api-product-firefox-desktop-product-mobile-firefox-for-android/)
* See it in action in [my code](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kits-api2/blob/master/get-questions-for-1-day.rb)
* Or in [Nancy's code:](https://github.com/mozilla-it/sumo/blob/master/Kitsune/get_kitsune_data.py) search for ```updated_lt``` and ```updated_gt```

My suggestions to Nicole Arksey (<a href="http://people.ece.ubc.ca/~rodgerl/pm2/uploads/NMi.MagicWorkshops/nicole.ppt">Nicole's powepoint slides</a>) and the rest of the team on Family Blog:
</p><ol>
<li>Don't call it a blog unless it has permanent links and generates RSS which Family Blog currently doesn't</li>
<li>Use a standard blogging engine like JRoller (if you must use Java :-) ), Wordpress or h*ck even Drupal and focus on the large display UI part. There's a blogging engine for every  technology and language so finding one shouldn't be a problem.</li>
<li>Instead of writing a client from scratch on the phone, leverage the capabilities of  the built in software. e.g. The N80i has LifeBlog built-in which supports the  Atom Publishing Protocol  and recent N series phones like the N93 and N95 have a built-in Gallery application that also supports the Atom Publishing Protocol. So re-work Family Blog to use a blogging engine that supports the Atom Publishing Protocol and you can use the built in software on the phone.</li>
</ol>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): May 22, 2022 10:02  [(2) Actually, on Twitter: "Via @cwarzel’s Galaxy Brain newsletter this morning: “Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement.” https://t.co/mfEEL3cUK4 Fascinating research paper about an important dynamic in social networks both online and off." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/eaton/status/1527676707360088065) --> From the paper, [Morally Motivated Networked Harassment as Normative Reinforcement](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/20563051211021378), : **QUOTE**: `The MMNH model suggests that moderation that examines individual content pieces to determine whether they violate community standards may miss the forest for the trees: that is, the amplifier effect of a major network node shaming an individual, resulting in networked harassment. ....In morally motivated networked harassment, a member of a social network or online community accuses a target of violating their network’s norms, triggering moral outrage. Network members send harassing messages to the target, reinforcing their adherence to the norm and signaling network membership. Frequently, harassment results in the accused self-censoring and thus regulates speech on social media. Neither platforms nor legal regulations protect against this form of harassment. `

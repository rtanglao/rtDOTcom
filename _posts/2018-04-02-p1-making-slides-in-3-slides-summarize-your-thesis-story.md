title: "In 3 slides visualize your thesis/story inspired by Kieran Healy's Making Slides"
---

## Pontifications
 
 * Probably Wrong way to make slides but my mantra: "In 3 slides visualize (not outline!!!!) your thesis/story"
 * If you can't do it in the first 3 slides then I'll fall asleep :-)
 * Also I love the idea of deliberately leaving things out and having slides for them in reserve for the Q&A (and leaving plenty i.e. most of the time for Q&A)
 * Inspired by [Kieran Healy's Making Slides](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2018/03/24/making-slides/) 
 * Maybe this is why I don't give many talks :-) ?!?!?

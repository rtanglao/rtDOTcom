But inexorably.  If the best office in the entire planet can't compete with the local coffee shop, the tightly-closed Pandora's box of "work from anywhere" has burst open, and will never be resealed.  No amount of begging or coercion is going to work in the long run: the businesses that demand it are fighting a losing war of attrition against an infinite universal energy....You heard it here folks:...The office is dead....But that doesn't mean collaboration is dead, or that community is dead.  It just means it's broken free from its stuffy, sterile confines, and is becoming something so much bigger, more dynamic, and more exciting.  Cafes and beaches and airplanes and kitchen tables around the world are the new office, and as someone who works from one of those every day, I couldn't personally be happier.`

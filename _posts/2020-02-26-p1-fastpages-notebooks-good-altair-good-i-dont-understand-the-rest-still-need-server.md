* This is why I love the premise of [iodide](https://alpha.iodide.io/) as I understand it :  you don't need a server! Any web browser can run your notebook code just like any web browser can render your static web pages. No extra server required.
* Anyways,  I am probably over-thinking the need for a server. We will always need servers :-) ! It's just that in my opinion every node even if it's just a laptop or better yet phone running a browser should be a server as well as a client!
* Check out the intro post: [introducing fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html)
* And then check out Stephen Downe's attempt to clarify "introducing fastpages" :-) :  [How to Use Fastpages](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2020/02/how-to-use-fastpages.html) 
* All in all something I should try!

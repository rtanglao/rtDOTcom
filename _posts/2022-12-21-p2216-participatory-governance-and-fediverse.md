[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 21, 2022 22:16 [Participatory Governance and the Fediverse](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2022/12/participatory-governance-and-fediverse.html) <-- Read the whole thing! --> QUOTE: `If we don't want a purely capitalist ownership of the fediverse (which is a real danger if we get a special social and institutional layer) then we lobby government (not software developers) to pay for it and manage it. That's kind of what has been done already with the W3C and the committee that designed the ActivityPub standard in the first place. It works, because nobody can own that standard. And the people who work on W3C are mostly paid by companies, contracts or governments.`

title: Round 3 - Nokia's App store requires a Valid SIM card to work

<p>Invalid SIMs don't allow you to download apps from the Nokia App store for some reason. Totally unfriendly. You just get an "download error" message (and the download partially succeeds without a SIM card). Anyhow, popped a valid SIM card in and was able to download ShutterPro and CameraPro finally! (see <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2011/10/02/round-2-cant-buy-apps-nokias-store-even-valid-credit-card-i-guess-ill-need-pop">part 2</a> for earlier attempts)</p>

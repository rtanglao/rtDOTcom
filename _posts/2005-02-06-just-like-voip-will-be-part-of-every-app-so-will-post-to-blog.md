<p>As I've written <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/07/28/every_app_should_have_a_save_to_blog_function">before</a>, everything should and will have 'Post to Blog' functionality in it including future versions of Office.</p><p>From <a href="http://www.byte.org/blog/_archives/2005/2/3/301937.html">Random Bytes...by Ross Rader :: Getting Microsoft to Support Blogware ...and LiveJournal ...and Flickr ...and...</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>If Microsoft built Office for their *customers* instead of their shareholders, they could probably wrap up online publishing in a *big* way. They would simply need to accept that they are great at writing publishing tools and crappy at writing server tools - at least server tools that give people warm fuzzies like MovableType and Flickr do. No one wants to use Sharepoint as the destination for their blog content - they want to use Blogware or Livejournal or Audioblog et al. And they don't want to use the crappy online weblog editors that I'm using to write this. We want feature rich content publishing MACHINES like Microsoft Word, Apple's Garageband or even Adobe's Premier. I'm currently typing this post into Blogware using a tiny little window, no spell-checker and the very strong chance that I'm going to click the wrong button and accidentally lose my post before I save it. This isn't a problem with Blogware, this is a problem with The Browser.

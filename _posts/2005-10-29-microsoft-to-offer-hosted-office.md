<p>This would be great if it worked on all browsers (not just IE) equally well. I'll believe it when I see it. Hopefully this won't be another half hearted Web effort (like IE) from M*crosoft.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/web2explorer/?p=41">Microsoft building a fully Web-based Office? </a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Microsoft is leaping into hosted applications big time. InformationWeek reports that Microsoft plans to offer hosted implementations of SharePoint, CRM and ERP applications. But the best quote in that article was left till last. A "Microsoft insider" was asked which other products and services Microsoft would host and the reply was: "Everything. Hosted Office. Everything hosted."</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

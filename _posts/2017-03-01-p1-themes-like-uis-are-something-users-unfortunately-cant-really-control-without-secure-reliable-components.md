## Pontifications

Themes like User Interfaces will not be user controllable until we have [secure components at all layers that users can mix and match](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/17/p1-software-is-hard-no-clean-separation-or-componentization/) i.e. compose. So that means [no true user control over Firefox themes](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/24/improving-themes-in-firefox/) (or Chrome themes, or Windows themes, or any other large piece of software's themes). We basically need a Smalltalk or LISP machine-like level of composability. We'll get there. We're at the point now where we have so much cheap & fast hardware that we can re-implement LISP and Smalltalk-like composable systems at scale (i.e affordable for all like a Raspberry Pi)! Progress will happen, unfortunately it's going to take another 5 or more years!

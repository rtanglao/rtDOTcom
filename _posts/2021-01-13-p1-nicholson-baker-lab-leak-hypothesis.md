* Nicholson Baker: [The Lab-Leak Hypothesis](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/coronavirus-lab-escape-theory.html)
  * "For more than 15 years, coronavirologists strove to prove that the  threat of SARS was ever present and must be defended against, and they  proved it by showing how they could doctor the viruses they stored in  order to force them to jump species and go directly from bats to humans. More and more bat viruses came in from the field teams, and they were  sequenced and synthesized and “rewired,” to use a term that Baric likes. In this international potluck supper of genetic cookery, hundreds of  new variant diseases were invented and stored. And then one day,  perhaps, somebody messed up. It’s at least a reasonable, “parsimonious”  explanation of what might have happened."
* Not sure what to believe here, not convinced!

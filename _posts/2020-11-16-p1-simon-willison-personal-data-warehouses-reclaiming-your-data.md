* Please refer to my previous post:   [Simon Willison - Datasette: instantly create and publish a read-only API for your SQLite databases](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/11/30/p1-simon-willison-Datasette-instantly-create-publish-API-SQLite-databases/)   
* Simon Willison: [Personal Data Warehouses: Reclaiming Your Data](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Nov/14/personal-data-warehouses/) <-- I attended the live talk which was given as a webinar and organized by github. Inspirational! Hope to have my own personal data warehouse someday with my flickr data, my tweets, my scraped instagram (since there's no API), flickr vancouver data) and perhaps even scraped facebook data (since there's no API surprise :-) NOT!)

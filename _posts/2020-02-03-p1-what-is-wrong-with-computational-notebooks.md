* Via [Stephen Downes](https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=70384):  "This article ([12 page PDF](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/pubs/Chattopadhyay2020CHI_NotebookPainpoints.pdf)) identifies the challenges and pain points of running things like data  analytics in things like Jupyter Notebooks. It's good to see this sort  of article, because while some people (including myself) have touted  this sort of approach as a way to generate dynamic and interactive  learning resources, the actuality is that they are far from usable for  the average person."

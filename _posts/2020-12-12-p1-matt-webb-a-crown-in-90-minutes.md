* Matt Webb: [The hard work of imagining, ThingsCon 2020](http://interconnected.org/home/2020/12/11/thingscon)

    * "Even last year, making and  fitting a new crown was a 2 week job requiring a specialist lab. Now my  neighbourhood dentist can do it, and I was in and out in less than 90  minutes. So the way 3D printing has come into the world is what I would call: same but faster. Faster teeth. Faster prototyping. Faster tools for injection moulding in factories.

        But we haven’t seen the society-wide impact...So is the Internet of Things more like what we *got* with 3D printing, or more like what we *imagined* we’d get? Is it same-but-more-efficient, or is it transformative?...Because of the Internet of Things, this situation has inverted, it is  inside out. There is now the computer, and one of the things that it  contains is the world.-".Answer: It's transformative because the Internet now contains the world!

Nice new features.  Good-bye Yahoo groups and your awful ads (eventually!).  Now I have to ask: are there RSS feeds? Doesn't look like it!

From <a href="http://www.google.com/googlegroups/about.html">About Google Groups 2 Beta</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>This new version of Google Groups builds on the success of  the original Google Groups's searchable Usenet archive. Now, not only  can you search and read more than 845 million Usenet postings, you can also  stay in touch with friends, family, and colleagues by creating your own  web groups, mailing lists, and email newsletters. 

New Groups features and improvements available on Google Labs include:
<ul><li>Group creation: Easily create, join, and search email-based mailing lists; administrative interface enables customized access controls to designate a group as public or restricted</li>
<li>Dynamic conversations: Postings to both Usenet and mailing lists appear in 10 seconds and are indexed within 10 minutes</li>
<li>Enhanced user interface: Track and mark favorite topics using the "My Groups" feature and view postings in a variety of ways including by message summary, title, or conversation view</li>
</ul>
As always, Google Groups never displays pop-ups or banner  ads. You see only relevant text ads of interest</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>.

## Pontifications

* Neither do I :-) That was so 12 years ago!!! January 26, 2006 to be precise
  * [My blog post from 12 years ago: VFS DIY Podcasting and Blogs and Wikis at VPL](http://rolandtanglao.com/2006/01/26/vfs-diy-podcasting-and-blogs-and-wikis-at-vpl/)
  * Robert's post from 12 years ago: [New Media BC Podcasting Session](http://blog.bigsnit.com/2005/12/28/new-media-bc-podcasting-session/
* I hear podcasting is back :-) I'll believe it when I see it
* Podcasting tech is here to stay but it's not what I envisioned! 
* I envisioned normal people doing short podcasts on their own domain instead of doing them on centralized platforms like Facebook and twitter and youtube.

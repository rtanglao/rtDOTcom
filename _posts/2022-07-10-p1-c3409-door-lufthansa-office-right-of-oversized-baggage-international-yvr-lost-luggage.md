* For the 3 other people interested in this (doesn't apply if you can manage to file your lost luggage report with Lufthansa's web app; instead I had to physically go to C3409 and the up the stairs to the right to the Lufthansa office at C4100 to file my report in perspon)

* The `C3049` doorway to the Lufthansa office (who handle lost luggage) is NOT in a secure area even though the sign says it is in a secure area! It is to the right of the oversized baggage counter in international at YVR aka Vancouver airport

* See Photos below:

<p>I'd like the following N8 Cameraphone Apps to avoid all the problems with accidental key presses and screen touches that I encounter every day:</p><ol><li>The default cameraphone app but with the default settings locked to still photo (not video), auto-focus, auto-white balance, no zoom, touch screen off.&nbsp; And with no way to exit other than by killing it. This would be the app I'd use most of the time!</li><li>A cameraphone app like #1 but with the settings locked to hyperfocal instead of auto-focus, no preview and again no way to exit other than by killing it. This would be the app I'd use for "cameraphone street photography"</li></ol><p><a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/">Ms. Jen</a>, can you write this for me? Or can we write this together?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 7, 2023 20:50 [The WELL: State of the World 2023: Bruce Sterling and Jon Lebkowsky](https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/522/State-of-the-World-2023-Bruce-St-page02.html#post30) <--- the pandemic triggered the next era. Shall we call it "Weirding (sadly mostly in a negative sense) for the rest of us" :-) ? --> QUOTE: `Things have gotten really damned weird. The point here is that Bruce
is right - the technolgically-enabled Modern Era is at least
suffering under its own weight, if not collapsing. I think
Cronenberg on Star Trek is a great metaphor - the Pandemic triggered
the next era.  Bruce is also right that there ain't a normal anymore
(and what if we thought there was one, ok.)...This may seem like a scattershot of chaotic factoids that create a
gestalt, and I hope you get that.  It's a metaphor of the times.`

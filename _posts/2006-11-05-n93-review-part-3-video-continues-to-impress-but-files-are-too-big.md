<p>The N93 Video is impressive but it takes a lot space. 100MB for 5 minutes. So, it's quite the chain of pain to get the video and share it (yeah I know you could compress it but that takes too much time!) since most sharing services e.g.blip.tv and revver only accept 100MB videos. My 5 minute video above of the Skyte is well over 100MB.  Luckily,  Google Video has no limit (but the average non techie non geek person is not going to go through the hoops that I went through to post on Google Video; they'll want something easier like YouTube; now that Google owns YouTube perhaps the limits will be raised!).</p> <p>Nokia needs to address this in future video phones probably by running a companion web service (or partnering with one) and also doing more compression in hardware.</p>

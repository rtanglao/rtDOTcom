[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jun 12, 2022 19:21  [NISTIR 8202, Blockchain Technology Overview Â¦ CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8202/final) <- QUOTE: `Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central repository) and usually without a central authority (i.e., a bank, company, or government). At their basic level, they enable a community of users to record transactions in a shared ledger within that community, such that under normal operation of the blockchain network no transaction can be changed once published. This document provides a high-level technical overview of blockchain technology. The purpose is to help readers understand how blockchain technology works.` <-- from 2018 not sure if it is still relevant :-) bet it is!

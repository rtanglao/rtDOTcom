This is really, really confusing

Do you find this all hopelessly confusing? I don’t blame you. I’m a professional web developer and a Python engineer of 20+ years and I can just about understand and internalize the above set of rules.

I don’t really have any suggestions for where we go from here. This stuff is hard to use. The more features and capabilities we pile onto these systems the harder it becomes to obtain true mastery of them and really understand what they can do and how best to put them into practice.

Maybe this doesn’t matter? I don’t know anyone with true mastery of Excel—to the point where they could compete in last week’s Microsoft Excel World Championship—and yet plenty of people derive enormous value from Excel despite only scratching the surface of what it can do.

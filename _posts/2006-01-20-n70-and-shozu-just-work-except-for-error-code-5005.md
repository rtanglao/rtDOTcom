<p>Update on <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/01/20/got-n70-hack-isync-transfer-phone-numbers-install-shozu">my new review N70</a>. The iSync hack worked, successfully synced my contacts and Shozu works for <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/search/tags:n70,shozu/tagmode:all/">photos</a> but doesn't seem to work for videos (even short 10 second ones). I keep getting error 5005.</p>

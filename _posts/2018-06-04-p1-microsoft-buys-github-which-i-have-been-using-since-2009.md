## Pontifications

* [i remember pitching a social coding talk with github with "The picker" aka the fabulous @jimpick back in 2009. So so many memories. it's great to share code urls, wish it wasn't private but a public utility somehow :-)](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1003401628525854720) 
* i.e. critical internet coding and other infrastructure should be nationalized and owned by the black helicopters :-) i.e. the word government i.e. the UN
* and/or it should be decentralized
* easier said than done!

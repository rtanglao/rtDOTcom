# Pontifications

* See Volker Weber's  [May Android Updates :: Samsung wins again](https://vowe.net/archives/017953.html) which shows the S10 got it's May update already and
* [sammobile:  When will my Galaxy phone get a security update?](https://www.sammobile.com/2019/05/13/samsung-galaxy-security-updates) <--- shows the Note 8 on the same update schedule as the S10
* Previously: [S\*msung Note 8 on F\*do received the Google April Security Patch on May 11, 2019](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/05/11/p2-samsung-note-8-on-fido-received-april2019-security-update-may11-2019/)

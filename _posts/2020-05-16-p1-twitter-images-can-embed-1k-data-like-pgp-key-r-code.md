* **QUOTE**--> I caught [this tweet](https://twitter.com/edent/status/1260843046553387009) by Terence Eden about using Twitter image alt-text to “PGP sign” tweet  and my mind immediately went to “how can I abuse this for covert  communications, malicious command-and-control, and embedding R code in  tweets?”.

  When you paste or upload an image to tweet (web interface, at least)  you have an opportunity to add “alt” text which is — in theory  — supposed to help communicate the content of the image to folks using  assistive technology. Terence figured out the alt-text limit on Twitter  is large (~1K) which is *plenty* of room for useful R code <-- **END QUOTE** <--- Read the whole thing: [@hrbrmstr](http://twitter.com/hrbrmstr): [Attach Your R Code To Charts You Tweet For Reproducible R Tweets!](https://rud.is/b/2020/05/16/attach-your-r-code-to-charts-you-tweet-for-reproducible-r-tweets/)

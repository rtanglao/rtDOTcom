title: "Maybe all those people who would've learned scripting languages on OS X are instead hacking those same scripting languages on Linux e.g. a $35 Raspberry PI and/or writing javascript/node.js apps in glitch or jsbin or jsfiddle or Android apps or IOS apps?"

# Pontifications

* I don't think it's the end of the World that [Apple is removing the built in scripting languages  in Mac OS X Catalina](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/06/04/scripting-languages-to-be-removed/) but ymmv :-)
* I've never developed a Perl/Python/PHP/Ruby script on OS X or in fact on any platform that I share with "normal folks" who aren't power users or developers (hobbyist or otherwise)
* Just like there's more good music (it's just not all hit parade stuff ) than ever I feel there's more good software than ever at the scripting / hobbyist level.

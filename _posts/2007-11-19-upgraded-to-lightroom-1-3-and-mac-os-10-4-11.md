<p>Did a backup first of course! Super Duper and my LaCie 160 GB Firewire 800 Drive rock! Have observed no problems unlike others! Lightroom 1.3 seems faster! Holding off on Leopard upgrade until all Lightroom niggles are sorted out. Haven&#39;t tried PictureSync with 1.3 but if it doesn&#39;t work there&#39;s a <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2007-11-16/637">supported Flickr exporter</a> now so that won&#39;t be an issue! <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">UPDATE</span> successfully posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/2046139559/">this photo</a> with the new exporter!</p><p>Â </p>

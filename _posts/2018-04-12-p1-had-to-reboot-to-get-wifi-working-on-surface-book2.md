title: "Had to Reboot my Surface Book 2 again (twice in two weeks) to get WiFi working, ipconfig dance didn't work"

## Pontifications

* Had to Reboot my Surface Book 2 again (twice in two weeks) to get WiFi working
* The ```ipconfig /release``` and then ```ipconfig /renew```  [powershell dance](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/25/p1-having-surface-book-2-80211ac-wifi-issues-ipconfig-release-renew-seems-to-fix-it/)  didn't work after a week!
* Other than this major :-) complaint, really like the computer and Windows 10 especially the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

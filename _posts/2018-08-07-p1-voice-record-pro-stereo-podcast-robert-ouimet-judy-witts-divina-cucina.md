title: "Robert Ouimet meets Judy Witts aka Divina Cucina recorded with iOS App Voice Record Pro and Roland Duo Capture EX"

## Pontifications

* Today I recorded with [Robert Ouimet](https://robertouimet.com/) using [Voice Record Pro](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/01/p1-voice-record-pro-records-stereo-through-ios-lightning-port/), Roland Duo Capture EX and the same two Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic USB/XLR mics (see [How we record over 40 in Vancouver](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/23/p1-how-we-record-over-40-in-vancouver/) for the full details; nothing has changed except for the iOS App; I used [Voice Record Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/voice-record-pro/id546983235?mt=8) instead of Audioboom), the story of how 1 or 2 years ago, he met Judy Witts aka [Divina Cucina](http://divinacucina.com/) who Barb and I hung out with Florence in 2001!

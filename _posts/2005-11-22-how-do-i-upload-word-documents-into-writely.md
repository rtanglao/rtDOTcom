<p>Sorry I tried but couldn't find a way to load Word documents from Writely! Is this my bad or has this feature not been turned on yet? Help! </p><p>From <a href="http://writely.blogspot.com/2005/11/writely-embraces-opendocument-movement.html">Writely Embraces the OpenDocument Movement</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Writely users can upload documents into Writely from Microsoft Word and Sun Microsystems' OpenOffice.org, as well as save the documents back into either of those formats</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

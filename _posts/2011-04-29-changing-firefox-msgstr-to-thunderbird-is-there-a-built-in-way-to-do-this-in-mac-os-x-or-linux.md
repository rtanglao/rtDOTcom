  in Mac OS X or Linux?

<p>In the course of customizing Mozilla's Kitsune knowledge base website for Thunderbird (from the great Mozilla SUMO dev team, thanks jsocol and team!) software, I needed to change locale strings to reference Thunderbird instead of Firefox. Locale strings consist of:</p><ul><li><em>msgid</em> e.g. "Firefox Help"</li><li>followed by <em>msgstr</em> which is the localized version e.g. "Firefox-Hilfe" (for the German locale)</li></ul><p>For Thunderbird I changed all occurences of Thunderbird to Firefox where there was a Thunderbird equivalent (I didn't change strings that have no Thunderbird equivalent e.g. there is no mobile version of Thunderbird so I left all mobile related strings unchanged). In the above example "Firefox-Hilfe" becomes "Thunderbird-Hilfe"</p><p>To do this automatically for all languages that the knowledge base for Thunderbird supports (which is dozens), I wrote a ruby script to do this: <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/kitsune-utils/blob/master/changeMessages-po-to-tb.rb">changeMessages-po-to-tb.rb</a></p><p>Of course this fails for languages where nouns are declined like Polish which in various situations uses "Firefoksa" instead of "Firefox" for example.</p><p>But it works for most of the locales and therefore has saved me and the localizers considerable time.</p><p>Is there a better way to do this? Perhaps a built in search and replace utilty in Linux or Mac OS X?</p>

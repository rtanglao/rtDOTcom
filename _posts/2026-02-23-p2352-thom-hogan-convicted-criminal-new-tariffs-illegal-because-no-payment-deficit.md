[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 24, 2026 07:52 (UTC) [ME:: tl;dr-ing: Because there is no payment deficit, the new 15% tariffs imposed by The Convicted Criminal are also illegal ; Thom Hogan:: Weekly News and Commentary for February 16 to 23 ¦ Cameras and Photography](https://bythom.com/newsviews/weekly-news-and-commentary-7.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `So, two things about that: (1) Congress will have to act within 150 days to extend these new 15% tariffs, and that's unlikely in the current environment because it would happen just before the next election; and (2) the reasoning is once again problematic, and will likely get tested by the courts as once again exceeding the authority given by Congress. Section 122 doesn't actually refer to "trade deficit" it refers to "payment deficit", of which the US has very little (the US heavily exports "services", which balances out "trade"). In essence, we have an autocratic regime that can't read and has indicated that they will do what they want and keep trying to find some methodology that might make tariffs stick. In other words, businesses still have no idea what their costs are (and will be), as they keep fluctuating as the tariff battle continues. `

* "In the last few years, a seemingly banal question of lifestyle hygiene  -- how much time, attention, and energy to devote to the screens of our  digital devices -- has somehow become overloaded with all sorts of  angsty philosophical baggage. In those same few years, I've become an  increasingly vocal critic of a particular reaction to that angst that  I've labeled [waldenponding](https://mailchi.mp/ribbonfarm/against-waldenponding), a broad tendency to retreat from, and artificially limit, digital life. I've gone from thinking of it as an annoying but mostly harmless  tendency to viewing it as an actively dangerous one." <--- read the whole thing [Against Waldenponding II](https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=78cbbb7f2882629a5157fa593&id=098f100576)

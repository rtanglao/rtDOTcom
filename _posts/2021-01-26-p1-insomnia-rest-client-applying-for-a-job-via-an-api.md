*  [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): 08september2020 [@maggiecodes_](https://twitter.com/maggiecodes_): [How I applied to a Tech Job using a POST request](https://dev.to/maggiecodes_/how-i-applied-to-a-tech-job-using-a-post-request-193d) <--- geeky but i love it, the job was "technical support engineer"  at plaid, an online finance company "There are numerous API tools out on the market. I chose to use Insomnia, an open-source API client  application, to send my request" <--- need to check out [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) which sounds great!
  * UPDATE: I'm using Insomnia for my [element.io work](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/12/20/p1-started-my-new-job-element-io-november30/) with Matrix APIs and it is indeed great!

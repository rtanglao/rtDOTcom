title: ARKit in iOS 11 points to eventual AR hardware support in iPhone? AR Sensor? AR processor?
---

## Pontifications
* Apple usually has something long term in mind so [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) seems like a work in progress that will take advantage of future hardware.
* It makes sense that the a.near.future.iPhone.next :-) (i.e. 7S or 8 or 9) will have some sort of AR hardware support e.g. AR Sensor? AR Processor?

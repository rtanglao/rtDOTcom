[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 30, 2022 08:27 [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/search?q=activitypub) <-- infosec.exchage/@ataxla wrote a zinger --> QUOTE: `so! if you run your own, you pretty much have to become a cache SRE, web-tier SRE, DB SRE, queue SRE, Rails SRE, you have to know how to secure unix systems, mitigate attacks, and if you're responsible, you have to do replication and backups....sure, Docker has made it so that you can stand up all of this easily, but long-term maintenance? are you really confident that you know what you're doing here? Oh, sure, you've offloaded a lot of this to your cloud provider, but then you're now dependent on that provider continuing to work. Unless you're a large corporation with a secure contract, your cloud provider most likely doesn't care about you. ...in short, standing up your own mastondon is signing up for a whole lot of Actual Work that we don't really want to do just to talk with friends, and we absolutely must stress that we both worked for twitter for 6 years and run our own **email server* for 21*`
<-- which leads me to my prediction; most non managed hosted mastodon instances will be gone in 2 years or less! Hope my prediction is wrong! I have run apache on my home server and it ain't pretty nor easy to self host over time even in a VPS in the cloud!

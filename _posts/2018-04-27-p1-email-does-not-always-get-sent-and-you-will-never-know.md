title: "Email doesn't alway get sent or get received and you will never know"

## Pontifications

* London Drugs photolab sent me an email to my gmail account about scans of prints and I never received it.
* Your reminder that when emails are sent they don't get sent sometimes or they don't get received due to no fault of the sender or receiver. It happens to me at least once  year and it has nothing to do with gmail or the email provider or the receiving email software.
* Email is unreliable! It's only unreliable less than 1% of the time so you get lulled into thinking it's fool-proof.

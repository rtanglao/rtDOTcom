<p>Platform evangelism aside, there really is nothing to do but to get a Mac. As I've said before, use a Mac for word processing, spreadsheets, email and web browsing and you won't have any problems. There's really no reason to have a Windows computer unless you need to run games and software like AutoCad that's only available on Windows.

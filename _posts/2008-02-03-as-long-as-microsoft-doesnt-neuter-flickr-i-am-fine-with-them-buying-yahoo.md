<p>As long as Microsoft doesn&#39;t neuter flickr (I don&#39;t use any other Yahoo or Microsoft services) I am fine with them buying Yahoo! Not that Microsoft cares what I think :-) !</p> <p>Neutering to me would include:</p> <ol>   <li>forcing us to use the Microsoft Live ID instead of my Yahoo ID</li>    <li>converting flickr to .NET or to using some other non open source system other than LAMP</li> </ol>But in the long run, Microsoft and Yahoo would be better off if they &quot;creatively self destructed&quot; into the following units:  <ol>   <li>Social Media Co - Yahoo Mail + Hotmail + flickr + delicious + MSN, etc</li>    <li>Windows Co - Windows XP, Vista and Mobile</li>    <li>Office Co - Word et al</li>    <li>Xbox Co - gaming</li>    <li>etc</li> </ol>But the odds of any of this kind of creative destruction are practically nil.

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 20, 2023 08:48 [How to Analyze Large Text Datasets with LangChain and Python](https://www.sitepoint.com/analyze-large-text-datasets-langchain-python/) <-- I'd like to do this with an open source version of LangChain --> **QUOTE**: `I added time.sleep(20) as comments, since it’s possible that you’ll hit rate limits when working with large texts, most likely if you have the free tier of the OpenAI API. Since I think it’s handy to know how many tokens and credits you’re using with your requests so as not to accidentally drain your account, I also used with get_openai_callback() as cb: to see how many tokens and credits are used for each chapter.`

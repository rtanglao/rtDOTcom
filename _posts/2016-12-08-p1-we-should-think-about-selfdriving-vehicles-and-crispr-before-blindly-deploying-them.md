title: We should be mindful of crispr and self driving vehicles
---

We should mindfully and intentionally think about the best way to use [crispr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) and self driving cars before deploying them. I doubt we will do so :-) but doesn't it make sense to think about the implications of easily remixing organisms in the case of crispr and the implications to jobs and society in the case of self driving vehicles?

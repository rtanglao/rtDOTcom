<p>Can't wait to try this out! Something like this is badly needed. I will try to post a mini-review later.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://blog.sxore.com/?p=5">Sxore 0.2 - sometimes the sequel is better</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Sxore 0.2 went live late last night. This release added a whack of new features and improvements, including:</p>

<p>- a photo picker - now you can personalize your blog comments with photos from several different sources, including Gravatar and Flickr. This picker is smart too - it'll find images for you automatically when you register.
</p>
<p>- photos, photos everywhere - your personal icon now shows up in blog posts, on sxore site, and even in RSS feeds.
</p>
<p>- rankings and tags - rankings and tags made by commenters are now aggregated and shown on the blog post.
</p>
<p>- follow page - see the contents of your follow feed and stop following conversations you're no longer interested in.
</p>
<p>... and a whole lot more.

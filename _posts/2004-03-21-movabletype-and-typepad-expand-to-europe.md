Congratulations! MovableType and TypePad's world wide expansion continues.

From <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/03/six_apart_and_u.html">Lo&#239;c Le Meur Blog: Six Apart and Ublog SA sign an exclusive representation agreement in Europe</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Mena, Ben, Barak and myself have been already working on this agreement for many weeks, I am very glad and honored to announce that Six Apart and my company Ublog SA have signed yesterday an exclusive representation agreement.

Ublog SA becomes the exclusive agent of Six Apart in Europe, Middle-East and Africa and has started distributing its leading weblogs publishing products, Typepad and Movable Type.

Typepad is already available in French and Spanish and will also be available in the next weeks in German and Dutch. Most European languages will follow shortly. Local Typepad and Movable Type websites will be launched very soon.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

Wow talk about a blast from the past.  I worked on network management software that used an OSI Q3 stack in England and Germany back in the 20th century! 1994-96 specifically.  It was for a never completed Passive Optical Network system and it was in C++ and not Java.  Good luck Erik, be curious to see what you come up with.

I'm looking for an OSI Q3 Stack implementation in Java. OSS or commercial, I don't really care. If anybody has heard of such a beast, please let me know.

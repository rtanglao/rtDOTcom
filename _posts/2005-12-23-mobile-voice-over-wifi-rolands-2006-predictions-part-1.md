<p>Remember my predictions are worth what you pay for them :-) </p> <p>Prediction number 1: There will be a usable (for early adopters, power users and geeks only unfortunately, the one for &quot;humans&quot; will come in 2007) Voice over WiFi client (using Skype or SIP) on a WiFi phone like the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nseries/index.html">N91</a>. All hail the start of the route around the mobile carriers. </p>

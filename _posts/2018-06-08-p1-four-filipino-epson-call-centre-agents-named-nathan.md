title: "Four Filipino Epson Printer Call Agents named Nathan :-)"
---

## Pontifications
* I'm guessing they were Filipino :-)
* I'm also guessing their real names weren't all "Nathan" :-) Nice script, Epson :-)
* Oh well all four Epson Support "Nathans" were competent, patient, friendly and efficient!
* I'll blog about this more when I get the replacement [Epson Ecotank ET-2750](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/28/p1-epson-et2750-stopped-working-and-a-spring-came-out/)

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Here's my take:</p>

<p>The only real defense for a technology company is innovation.
</p>
<p>I'm not saying technology companies shouldn't pursue patents. They should. Investors and stakeholders will tolerate nothing less. But in the end, innovation is what makes the difference.
</p>
<p>Innovation can topple even the biggest monopoly ever. You know who I'm talkin' about.
</p>
<p>My motto? Innovation trumps litigation.</p></blockquote>

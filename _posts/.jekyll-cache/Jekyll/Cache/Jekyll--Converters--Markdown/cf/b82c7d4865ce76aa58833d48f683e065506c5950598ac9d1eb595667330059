I"ö<p>I need 2 Phone numbers and 2 SIM cards, one for the N95 (which is currently SIM-less but I sure do miss 3rd party programs like ShoZu and <a href="http://qik.com/roland">Qik</a> (e.g. it was alot of fun to <a href="http://qik.com/video/3982">Qik the Farmers Market on Dec 22</a> in real time and have people sending me comments asking about kolrabi and blueberry honey :-) !) happening in real time over the cell network instead of delayed until I get to a WiFi hotspot) and one for the iPhone (which I love for its ease especially for texting and fantastic web browser). My hope is that Rogers introduces a decent all you can eat (well 1-2 GB or less for less than $75 a month) when they give in to the inevitable and introduce the iPhone in Canada.</p>

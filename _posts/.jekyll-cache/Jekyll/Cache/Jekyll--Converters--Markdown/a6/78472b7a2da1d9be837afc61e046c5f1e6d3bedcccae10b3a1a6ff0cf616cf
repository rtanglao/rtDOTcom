I"<p><a href="http://nowpublic.com/">NowPublic</a> is now public! Another Vancouver company innovates! I think that their biggest innovation (so far) is the concept of an "assignment". Anybody who is a member of the site can create an assignment like "cover the 2005 Vancouver Wine Festival" and then members can sign up and contribute photos (and in the future) videos to cover this assignment.<p>From <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/node/3864">News | NowPublic.com (beta).</a>:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Assignments come from people on the ground, insiders, community leaders. Footage comes from eye witnesses, citizen reporters, people close to the real story. It's open source news, and even in its infancy it's richer, faster, more powerful than the infotainment it replaces.

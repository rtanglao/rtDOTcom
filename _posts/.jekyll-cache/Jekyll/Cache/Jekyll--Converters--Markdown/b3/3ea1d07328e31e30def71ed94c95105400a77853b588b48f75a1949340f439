I"Å<p>Even though flickr will support small videos in 2006, flickr itself will not be "the flickr of video" and no flickr of video will emerge in 2006. Lots of experimentation and startups but like the photoblogs before flickr, nothing will stick. My prediction is that "the flickr of video" will emerge in 2007. Love to be proven wrong on this one! Cause I want the flickr of video!</p>

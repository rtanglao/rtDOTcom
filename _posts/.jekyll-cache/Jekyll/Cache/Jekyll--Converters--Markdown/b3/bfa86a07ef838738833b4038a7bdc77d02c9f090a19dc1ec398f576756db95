<p>As I said in <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/CCC">my interesting Vancouver 2010 talk</a>, this is the golden age of computing NOT the 70s and 80s like lots of folks seem to think. Write an awesome Javascript app (or just a fun proof of concept like <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/11/03/revolution-not-yet-geo-tagged-camera-blogged-aka-search-das-blinkenlights">my flickr Average Geo Tagged real time photos from 18 cities hack</a>) and it works on millions of desktops and mobiles e.g.:Android, iPhone, Meego, Maemo, Mac, Windows and soon Symbian once Symbian gets a modern web browser. Share the code on github and make a video on YouTube and you can get recognition you could never get in the Internet less days of Creative Computing and Byte in the 1970s. Sure there are compatibility problems but nothing like the differences between Applesoft Basic, Commodore Pet Basic, Basic on the IBM PC (what was it called)?</p>

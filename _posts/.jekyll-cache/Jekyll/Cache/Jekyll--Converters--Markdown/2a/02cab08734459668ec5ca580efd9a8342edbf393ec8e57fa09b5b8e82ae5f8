I"A<p>I agree with <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan</a>. <a href="http://www.qoop.com/">Qoop</a> is cool but its <a href="http://www.qoop.com/photobooks/flickr_user">flickr</a> support needs some beta luuuuv.  It's cool that it supports photosets but it should also support flickr tags. Also it shouldn't <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/c32716a8f8a42372394cb4f7b47a52df">timeout</a>  when confronted with the 14000 photos on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/">my public flickr account</a> (admittedly, most people don't have 14000 photos but I bet lots have more than 1000!) and it shouldn't take over 20 minutes to generate a photo book of the 1198 images on my non public flickr account. Hopefully they will improve in <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/03/22/yahoo_buys_flickr_flickrtime_rules_for_web_20_apps">flickrTime</a>. Go Qoop go!</p>

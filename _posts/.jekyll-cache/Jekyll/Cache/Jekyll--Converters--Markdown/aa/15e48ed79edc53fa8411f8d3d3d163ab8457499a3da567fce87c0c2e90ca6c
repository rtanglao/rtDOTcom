<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>And I'm holding one (Sam Gentile, Dan Appleman, and Rod Paddock, the publisher of CoDE magazine, all say they'll be there) on Thursday night (the 29th). We'll meet at the Bellevue Barnes and Noble (the one downtown Bellevue) at 7 p.m. (Dan Appleman is doing a book signing) and then we'll move to Rock Bottom Brewery (probably be there starting at about 7:30). Everyone's invited.</blockquote>

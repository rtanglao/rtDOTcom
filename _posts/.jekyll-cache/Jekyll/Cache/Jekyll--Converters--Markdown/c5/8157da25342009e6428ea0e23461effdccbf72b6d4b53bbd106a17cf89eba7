Here are some thoughts on DrupalCamp LA and this part of California in general:&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;ul&gt;       &lt;li&gt;People - loved meeting up with our close partners at <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/">WorkHabit</a> (great to finally meet Earnest and Dominic) as well as meeting some new folks like <a href="http://apperceive.com/">Markus</a>, <a href="http://jensimmons.com/">Jen</a>, Mike, Steve, the army from <a href="http://www.achieveinternet.com/blog/">Achieve Internet</a> (thanks for the drink and food on Saturday!) and many others&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;<a href="http://bryght.com/blog/roland-tanglao/drupalcamp-la-drupal-install-profile-session-now-with-updated-slides">Drupal Install Profiles</a> - not only do you want one, but if you are a consulting shop, you need one, watch for Boris's follow-on presentation at DrupalCon Barcelona&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;<a href="http://bryght.com/blog/roland-tanglao/10-minutes-on-drupal-deployment-jonathan-lambert-drupalcamp-la-2007">Deployment</a> - as ably presented by Jonathan of WorkHabit and Mike - What happens if you have hundreds of sites and need to upgrade them? What do you do if you have a popular social media Drupal site with content being added continuously and users being added continuously and you want to upgrade it? Bryght and WorkHabit have been dealing with these issues since 2004, it's now hitting other big time firms in the Drupal ecosystem like Lullabot, Warner Brothers and Achieve Internet. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/DAST">DAST</a>, <a href="http://www.workhabit.org/projects/autopilot">AutoPilot</a>, and <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/hm2">Hostmaster 2</a> are the keywords to watch.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Theming - I enjoyed the beginning of Milind's Drupal theming presentation. I wish I had time to synthesize all the Drupal theming presentations I have seen into one Godzilla kick a*s one :-)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Venue - AOL Beverly Hills was spectacular. Great conference rooms, kitchen and lots of places to sleep, recharge and hold informal meetings and the bandwidth rocked. I uploaded many many photos at consistently at 100KB/second!&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Cars - shiny, big and expensive (many many Mercedes and BMWs) seems to be the order of the day. I drove brother in law's Andy's 2001 BMW 330 for 20 minutes; I am not into cars but if I was it would be BMWs - I'll stick to cheap, cheerful and economical Japanese cars like Hondas. The Armenian taxi drive who took me to meet my Mom was thankful to his Filipino doctor and when he heard I was of Filipino heritage and meeting my Mom, he drove very fast and very safe in his big American taxi.&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Mirror World (Ã  la Gibson's <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/pattern.asp">Pattern Recognition</a>) - LA seems to be a subtly different mirror of those days in Vancouver when it's sunny: every street is big and wide unlike Vancouver, the sun shines perpetually unlike Vancouver which bizarrely had the same weather as LA but a few degrees cooler, there are freeways everywhere unlike Vancouver (which could have gone down that path but through hard work and accidents of history did not)&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Food: My brother in law took good care of me: delicious Japanese organic food at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/V8KXkj4sDhRlS5G6z8-79g">Fukada</a> in Irvine, great coffee at <a href="http://losangeles.citysearch.com/profile/150152/venice_ca/abbot_s_habit.html">Abbot's Habit</a>, great Mexican food, yummy retro Italian American at <a href="http://search.cityguide.aol.com/losangeles/restaurants/andres-italian-restaurant-and-pizzeria/v-100071500">Andre's</a> with my Mom who happened to be in town and my aunt, can't wait to go back to Glendale and eat some seriously delicious and inexpensive Filipino food&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;li&gt;Capitalism: 15 million people with lots of entertainment meant great shopping: <a href="http://www.samys.com/">Samy's</a> rocks for photo stuff (bought a FireWire 800 Compact Flash Reader to replace my broken USB one) and I went to two Apple Stores and Fry's&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;/ul&gt;<br /></p>

<a href="http://www.stevelawson.net/wordpress/">Steve</a> Rocks (literally since he's a bass player! And figuratively since he's an articulate and very cool person!) ! Met him in Finland at <a href="http://womhelsinki08.pbwiki.com/FrontPage">Nokia Open Lab 2008</a>. I applied to the program so, &quot;Global Omnipresent Delivery Services&quot; (GODS hat tip to <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/">Neal Stephenson</a>) and Nokia willing, the N96 will make its way to Vancouver (<a href="http://twitter.com/igorskee/statuses/825635928">apparently the N96 was designed/integrated in Vancouver</a>) for me to take it on a <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=cameraphone+bicycle&amp;m=tags&amp;w=35034347371%40N01&amp;s=int">bicycle</a> and have my devious (ha ha !) ways

	A few weeks back I was contacted about a project involving the Nokia N96 - the idea was to send one round the world, getting various people to use it, upload video and photos, add apps to the phone itself, leave stuff on it, basically put it through its paces and tell a story… It’s a great fun idea, and I’m the first one to get it! So I’ve got a brand new lovely N96 to play with for a week or so.

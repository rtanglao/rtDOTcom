<p>More stream of consciousness this time focused on photos (after taking about 50 from a bicycle today):</p>
<ol><li>Sure would be nice to be able to turn off the touch UI. Many times I accidentally touched the screen and switched to the secondary camera, accidentally engaged the digital zoom or&nbsp; changed some camera setting that I didn't want to change.</li><li>Would be nice to have the 'touch the screen' focus that the iPhone 3GS has. Unbelievable that Nokia didn't come up with this first!</li><li>The new camera chip and software is fast! The new 1/1000 shutter speed means it's very difficult to take blurry photos in sunlight which for me is a drag (but admitedly&nbsp; my obsession with taking blurry photos of passing trains, cars and buses is not normal :-) !) <strong>I want my blurry photos back, anybody know how to do this?</strong> I tried night mode and setting the ISO to the lowest setting to no avail.</li><li>ShoZu crashed but this is not a surprise since I am using the 5800 version i.e. an unofficially unsupported version.</li><li>Would be nice to have a mechanical latch to prevent the keyboard from sliding out while taking pictures during my bicycle ride!</li><li>All in all I like the camera for taking stills (video is next thing to try) but I think that if you are focused on photos then a more traditional form factor phone without touch like the N86 8MP would be the way to go.</li></ol>

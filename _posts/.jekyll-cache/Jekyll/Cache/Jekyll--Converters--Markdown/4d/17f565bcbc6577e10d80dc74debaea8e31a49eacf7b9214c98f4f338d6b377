<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Liferea is a simple FeedReader clone for Unix distributions with GTK2 (GNOME2 is optional).  It is a news aggregator for RSS/RDF feeds which also supports CDF channels, Atom/Echo/PIE feeds and OCS or OPML directories. The problem with FeedReader: for now its only available for Windows. There are some projects  for GNU/Linux, but no solution for GTK/GNOME, which does not require  Python or Perl. Liferea tries to fill this gap. Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader.</blockquote>

Bottom line so far: for the power multi-media creator user, Nokia's phones are much better and I would pay my own money for a Nokia N95 or N93 or my mythical <a href="/rt/tags/n999">N999</a>, I wouldn't pay my own money for the KRZR. &lt;/p&gt; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/417052257/" title="Trial KRZR K1 - cool metal case"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/417052257_db84f1eff4_s.jpg" alt="Trial KRZR K1 - Image164" width="75" height="75" align="left" /></a>  <br /> <br /><br />  &lt;h2&gt;Cool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Came in an awesome aluminum briefcase&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Great form factor and light weight&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;USB Charging&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Text Auto Complete even with ITAP turned off&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Camera has a nice mirror for self portraits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h2&gt;NOT COOL:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cheesy Operating System (ugly to me but YMMV)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adapter for normal headphones must be unplugged to answer a call!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;no flash for camera - Nokia flash is not great but better than nothing. Sony Ericsson flashes are much better!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the web browser doesn't allow you to change the home page (Rogers bug not Motorola bug?)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the web browser is primitive and bad - sorry to be harsh, but compared to Nokia's Web kit browser or Opera, this browser is a toy: it doesn't support upload of attachments to mobile gmail, no way to enter a URL to surf to (you have to create a bookmark), many, many problems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ShoZu doesn't work on this phone (Rogers bug?). A phone without ShoZu is like a phone without sunshine :-) !&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;No WiFi - I wouldn't pay my own money for a phone without WiFi&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;No obvious way to upload your photos or videos without going through USB or Bluetooth "chain of pain" - I prefer ShoZu but there's no support to upload photos to flickr and photos and video to Vox which the built in Nokia gallery app on all recent N series phones does&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Voice Recognition doesn't work for all commands (e,g, I can't turn off Bluetooth with a voice command)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;</p>

I"–<p>Laugh out loud! How about if you wanted to modify your car, you'd have to ask the car manufacturer for a certificate to allow you to run your modification. Otherwise, every time you used your modification, the car would warn you that your modification is untrusted. And I don't think those garages are "shady". Using more than one brand of fuel is a right not a privilege!

<blockquote><p>7. When you buy a car, you have to promise to keep it for two years, during which you can only use one brand of fuel - although some shady garages will "unlock" your car. You can also refuel over the air, as well as garages but over the air costs twice as much as it's so convenient and cool.</p></blockquote>

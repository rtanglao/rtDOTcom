<p>An excellent passionate presentation from a non techie, non power user liberal arts person (!) who actually uses blogs in her Irish literature classes.</p>

<p>Some notes:
Everybody has something to offer.</p>

<p>Barbara engages and starts the community right away using a pre-course blog assignment.  Itâ€™s open, connected and public.</p>

<p>Uses Leviâ€™s knowledge trees.</p>

<p>Hypertext links of blogs creates connective tissue between inside and outside classroom, studies.</p>

<p>Blogging becomes a catalyst for emergence.
 Barbara sets it up and gets out of the way quickly.</p>

<p>The plan is for students to learn more from their fellow students than the professor</p>

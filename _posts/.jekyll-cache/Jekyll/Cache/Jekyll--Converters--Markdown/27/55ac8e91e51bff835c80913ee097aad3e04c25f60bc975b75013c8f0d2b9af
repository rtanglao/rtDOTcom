<ul>
  <li>We will have an ML Winter.</li>
  <li>Like the â€œ<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI Winter</a>â€ it will cause a backlash and a decrease in funding.</li>
  <li>Maybe when machine learning causes a car to crash and kill folks in a city?</li>
  <li>Maybe when expert systems like Alexa, Siri and Google Now fail spectacularly?</li>
  <li>I think itâ€™s a question of if not when but hopefully I am wrong.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning is better but mainly because of more memory, faster networks and faster CPUs. But itâ€™s not a breakthrough as far as I can tell; itâ€™s still based on 1940s-1960s neural networks and other â€œAIâ€.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m hoping for a 21st century breakthrough.</li>
  <li>In spite of that I think self driving cars powered by machine learning can and will work in dense urban centres.</li>
</ul>

<p>Themes like User Interfaces will not be user controllable until we have <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/17/p1-software-is-hard-no-clean-separation-or-componentization/">secure components at all layers that users can mix and match</a> i.e. compose. So that means <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2017/02/24/improving-themes-in-firefox/">no true user control over Firefox themes</a> (or Chrome themes, or Windows themes, or any other large piece of software‚Äôs themes). We basically need a Smalltalk or LISP machine-like level of composability. We‚Äôll get there. We‚Äôre at the point now where we have so much cheap &amp; fast hardware that we can re-implement LISP and Smalltalk-like composable systems at scale (i.e affordable for all like a Raspberry Pi)! Progress will happen, unfortunately it‚Äôs going to take another 5 or more years!</p>

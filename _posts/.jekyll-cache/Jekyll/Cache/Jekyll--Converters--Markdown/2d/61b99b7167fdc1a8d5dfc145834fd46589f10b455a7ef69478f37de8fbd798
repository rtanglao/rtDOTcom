<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Thanks to a beta release of their Windows Mobile software, Skype Technologies&nbsp;is letting PPC users place phone calls using voice over IP (VoIP) for free. The only requirements are a Windows Mobile 2003 device with a 400MHz processor and headset, along with an internet connection and friends who also have the application installed. The PDA version of this software, PocketSkype, is based on the desktop version Skype Technologies has been distributing for some time. Users of the desktop version can even use their same account information to use PocketSkype, although contact lists have to be manually added.</blockquote>

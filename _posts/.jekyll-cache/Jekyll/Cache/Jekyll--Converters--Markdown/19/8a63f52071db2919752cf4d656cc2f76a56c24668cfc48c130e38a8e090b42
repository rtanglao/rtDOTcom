I"<p>Really looking forward to ecto3&#39;s new WYSIWYG editor that supports nested lists. I tried ecto3 in the last <a href="/rt/archives/2007/08/26/n800-skype-wifi-great-telco-long-distance-route-around">2</a> <a href="/rt/archives/2007/08/27/the-internet-does-not-revolve-around-the-telcos-billing-engine">posts</a> (using the MovableType settings for my Drupal site) but I can&#39;t use it because it doesn&#39;t recognize new categories added on the server side and new categories on the ecto 3 alpha client don&#39;t show up on the Drupal server side.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll report my findings to the support forum and monitor the situation. Once the bugs are shaken out, it looks like a great new release (many new features coming e.g. the ability to type a few characters and whittle down my 794 categories rocks for example!). Go Adriaan go!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://infinite-sushi.com/software/ecto/news/2007/08/ecto3_alpha.php">infinite-sushi.com - ecto3 alpha</a>:  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   First of all, ecto3 is not ecto2. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   â€¦ &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   .One of the biggest changes is that ecto3 has a new rich text editor, one that is based on Apple's very own Editable WebKit. It allowed me to do the nested list above. It does the job far better than ecto2, but it's not perfect yet. More than 3500 lines of code interface between the GUI editor and WebKit to make it work for blogging. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   â€¦ &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   .So far, ecto3 has support for MovableType, WordPress and Blogger. There's a custom version of the MovableType plugin for Conversant, a Vox plugin is on the way, as well as a plugin that will use the old Blogger API for some of the blog systems around that haven't gone with the times. This basically means that people using MovableType, WordPress or Blogger are the best candidates for playing with this alpha version, for now. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

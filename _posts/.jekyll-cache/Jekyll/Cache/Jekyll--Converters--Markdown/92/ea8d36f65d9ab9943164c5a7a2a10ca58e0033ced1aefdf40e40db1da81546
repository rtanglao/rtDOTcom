I"<p>I'm leaning towards <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Berlind/?p=34">the iRiver H320 because it seems a lot more versatile according to David Berlind</a>! I wish David would post an update! Patience!</p>

<blockquote><p>I have posted a picture of my "new" portable podcasting setup.
</p>
<p>For input I am using: Sony ECM-MS907 microphone; and Samsung YP-T5V MP3 Player for music &amp; audio input. </p>

<p>Mixer is the: Rolls MX56S.</p>

<p>The output goes into my iRiver iFP-799  player for recording and I can listen to the mixed output using my Koss QZ headphones.</p>

<p>The small mic stand is from Radio Shack.</p>

<p>All of this is battery operated, and with no computer in the loop for the actual recording of the content. ;-)</p> </blockquote>

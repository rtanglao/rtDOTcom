  <li><a href="https://blog.hammerhead.io/karoo-vs-smartphone-98b5fe89d30b">Karoo</a> #iWantToBelieve But You are Based on Android 6.0 which was introduced in October 2015 which means monthly security updates will cease on October 2019 (<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/05/27/p1-going-to-have-to-disagree-with-the-wirecutter-about-android-buy-every-2-years/">since Android OS updates only happen for 2-4 years from launch of that OS version</a>) or earlier so if I buy a Karoo in late 2017 I can only use it for a year or two until itâ€™s vulnerable forever right? What am I missing?</li>

I"<p>A belated gig change post: Since July 21, 2009, I have been <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/2009/05/15/support-job/">Technical Support Lead</a> at <a href="http://en-us.www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/">Mozilla Messaging</a>. It's been quite the wild ride. I have been immersed in Mozilla Messaging's product, the open source <a href="http://en-us.www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>&nbsp; Email client (in particular getting ready for Thunderbird 3 currently scheduled for November which has a plethora of improvements including the super spiffy global search) as well as tweaking the <a href="http://blogs.mozillamessaging.com/roland/2009/09/30/get-satisfaction-25-months-in/">Mozilla Messaging Implementation of Get Satisfaction</a> for <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/mozilla_messaging">Thunderbird support</a> as well as starting the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520628">deployment of a Knowledge Base for Thunderbird</a>. Busy times! Good times!</p>
<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: I'd completely forgotten the intensity of focus that's needed to ship a big product like Thunderbird; couple that with the knowledge that millions of people will be using it and with the history of Mozilla makes for a unique experience for me because the Unix network management software I worked on at Nortel was big but only used by 100s of users and even then by all reports most of the features were unused, contrast that with Thunderbird where seemingly every feature no matter how obscure is used by lots of folks!</p>

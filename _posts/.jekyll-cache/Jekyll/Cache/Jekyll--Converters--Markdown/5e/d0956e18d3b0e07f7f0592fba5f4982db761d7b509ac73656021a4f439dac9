I"_<p>Sometime early last year (was it late January or early February? I think it was early Febrary), I was given a peek at Flickr.  I uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/archives/date-posted/2004/02/11/">my first photo on February 10, 2004</a>. But didn't really use it until upload via email was added. I think that was the tipping point for me.  It's bizarre to think that I used to upload photos without tagging them, but that's how it was for me until the "edit as a batch" feature and the APIs that enabled cool 3rd party uploaders like the <a href="http://www.speirs.org/flickrexport/">Flickr Export</a> module were introduced.
</p>
<p>Congrats, Flickr! Schoene Geburtstag! Viel Glueck! I look forward to uploading <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/">8000</a> (it's hard to believe I uploaded 6000 public and 2000 private photos in one year but that's really how many photos I take a year!) more photos in the next year. And you continuing to do no evil by having great APIs that allow people to easily upload, download and manipulate their photos.

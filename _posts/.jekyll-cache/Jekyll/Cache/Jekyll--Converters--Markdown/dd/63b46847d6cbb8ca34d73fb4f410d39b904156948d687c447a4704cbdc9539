I have started a personal Google Wiki called &quot;<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/bugadventures/">BUG Adventures</a>&quot; to track my adventures with my <a href="http://buglabs.net/">Bug Lab</a>s BUG. There's not much there for now other than some newbie eclipse questions and  the usual anti-Java whingeing :-)  (since I have only played with my BUG for about an hour), but if you are interested you can check it out at your leisure. 
</p>
<p>
The question of the moment is: what is <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/3088055777/in/set-72157610837577626/">this</a> ? (couldn't find it in the wiki and manuals but then again I only searched for about 15 minutes!) 
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, I'll post highlights here.

  <li>Dave had a great idea: <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/11/26.html#a141824">an app to automatically commit this blog to git and upload to github daily</a>!</li>
  <li>If we had a github post commit hook that ran jekyll  in the cloud and then uploaded to surge.sh again in the cloud perhaps using heroku weâ€™d then wouldnâ€™t need a computer with jekyll and ruby installed, just a phone or anything that runs a web browser so we could update this blog from everywhere! Iâ€™ve tried heroku in the past but Iâ€™ve found it clunky and I donâ€™t trust their free plan to stick around forever! (and as always I need to re-try heroku again, maybe itâ€™s less clunky now?)</li>

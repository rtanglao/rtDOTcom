Ha ha, thanks <a href="http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/author/admin">Ewan</a>. I guess after posting <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/shozu">21000 photos with ShoZu</a> I am a ShoZu Grand Master. Glad to help! Vanouverites with Nokia cameraphones please text me at 604 729 7924 or twitter @rtanglao or leave a comment. I am really looking forward to helping others use ShoZu.

	Yes, Roland Tanglao has grabbed hold of the MIR ShoZu Campaign Mantle and thrust a stake in the ground right in the centre of Vancouver.
	</p>
	<p>
	To paraphrase the A-Team introduction: ‚ÄúIf nobody else can help, and if you can find him, maybe you can hire Roland Tanglao.‚Äù
	</p>
	<p>
	That‚Äôs right, Roland is offering to help anyone understand, install and setup ShoZu ‚Äî although he rightly points out that if you‚Äôre using an iPhone, you probably don‚Äôt need any help as it‚Äôs so easy.
	</p>
	<p>
	But if you‚Äôre in need, buy Roland a $2.25 macchiato and the knowledge is yours. What a deal. Even if you‚Äôre already a dab hand at ShoZu, you might want to hook up with Roland anyway and say hi.

  <li>Sure the Pixel has a slightly better still camera than the iPhone 7 but definitely not better than a 7 Plus.</li>
  <li>But it doesnâ€™t have water resistance and an SD card slot like the Samsung S7.</li>
  <li>And it doesnâ€™t have a a 2x optical zoom.</li>
  <li>And itâ€™s expensive at $CDN 899 which is basically iPhone prices for something thatâ€™s not better than the iPhone for normal users. Normal users wonâ€™t pixel peep and care about the still camera being slightly better. They will understand the value of water resistance and a zoom. (And an SD card slot in the case of the S7)</li>
  <li>So Iâ€™m going to have to say that if this was the National Hockey League, then Iâ€™d predict theyâ€™d make the playoffs but not win the Stanley Cup :-)</li>
  <li>Maybe next year or the year after? Keep trying Google! You need table stakes of water resistance and a zoom. And something to go to where the puck hasnâ€™t been.</li>

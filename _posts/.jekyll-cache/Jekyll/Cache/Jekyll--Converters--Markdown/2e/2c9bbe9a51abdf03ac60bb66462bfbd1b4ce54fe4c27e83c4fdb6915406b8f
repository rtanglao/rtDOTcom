  <li><strong>QUOTE</strong> ‚Äì&gt; We have forgotten that the need of the person drilling into wood to make a piece of art or craft is <em>not</em> for a drill ‚Äî faster, quieter, more efficient, or more ergonomic. It is for a <em>hole</em>. If we want to escape imaginative poverty, we are going to have to relearn and re-practice imagining <em>how else we might meet the need for a hole</em>, rather than how we might add ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù to the drill, or connect it to  the internet to do something flashy that could not be done otherwise,  just to produce <em>the same damn hole</em>. In many industries, what is called ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù has forsaken responding to what is <em>needed</em> in favour of what is <em>possible</em> (which requires much less imagination). <strong>END QUOTE</strong> &lt;‚Äî Read the whole thing: <a href="https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2020/05/19/there-must-be-a-better-way/">Dave Pollard: There must be a better way</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2019/11/06/Tyee-Commenters-Assessed/">Hey Tyee Commenters! Scholars Studied You. Hereâ€™s What They Found</a> &lt;â€“ This leads me to believe thereâ€™s something to â€˜de-rantingâ€™ i.e. only displaying ranting language to the â€˜original ranterâ€™. See my post from  2018: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/27/p1-remove-insults-rants-non-constructive-feedback/">De-ranting: Making non constructive feedback visible only to the person who posted it)</a>, everybody else only sees the constructive language.</li>
  <li>Of course training a machine learning model to identify this non constructive ranting language is the only way to go for popular sites.</li>
  <li>Would de-ranting scale? Not sure! Especially if machine learning couldnâ€™t be trained to help most of the time. I would love to experiment with this.</li>

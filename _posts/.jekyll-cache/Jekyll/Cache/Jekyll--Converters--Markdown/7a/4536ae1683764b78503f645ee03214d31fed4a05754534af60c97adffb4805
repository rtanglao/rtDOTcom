<p> I want both an iPhone and the <a href="/rt/archives/2006/12/28/2007-the-year-of-the-blogaphone-the-nokia-n999">N999</a>. The 1.0 iPhone ain&#39;t a <a href="/rt/archives/2006/11/17/blogaphone-i-want-it-n95-plus-keyboard">blogaphone</a> unless it has a video camera and Shozu-like tech built in (or you can add it which you can&#39;t in 1.0) but other than that it&#39;s pretty darned close. Until then I will also carry the closest N999 equivalent which will probably be an an N95 (which I got to examine yesterday thanks to the <a href="http://comvu.com/">Comvu</a> folks and the screen is fab and it feels light and nice in the hand!). </p>
<p> Thank-goodness for Apple! Now we wil get some innovation in the mobile space. Series 60 and Symbian OS really need some re-thinking  in terms of usability and needs to get more stable. Even with just the built-in software, I regularly have to reboot my N93 and the other Series 60 Symbian devices I get for free trial from Nokia Blogger Relations; this is unacceptable! </p>

I"Ð<p>I would like to have formal (but of course optional) pre and post conference dinners next time. It helps the unity and flow of the conference IMHO.

<p>I think Boris' idea of having the pre conference dinner as a pasta event where one of the organizers and/or volunteeers does the cooking (Boris kind of volunteered to do this). Would be cool to cook pasta for a 100 meat eaters and vegetarians and to have everybody in the same room. And we could probably do it for almost free assuming we can find a cheap venue. Just need to find a venue that would let us cook!

I"ü<p>Agreed 100%. I have tried the marketing first, demo second approach and it doesn't work. Either you run out of time or you lose the audience if you start off with marketing. If I want to know the marketing stuff, I can get it from your blog and website or as a link AFTER the demo.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/01/04.html#a1143">Jon Udell: Screencast guidelines</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Show, don't tell. I've been on the receiving end of a great many WebEx-style demos over the years. The usual pattern is slides first, explaining the company, its market, and its product. Then, if there's time, comes the demo.

<p>Though it may seem counterintuitive, I'd rather do it the other way around. For me, and for the viewer, the ideal screencast begins with a very brief stage-setting introduction. But it's mainly a compelling demonstration of, and conversation about, a product in actual use. There are few, if any, slides.</p></blockquote>

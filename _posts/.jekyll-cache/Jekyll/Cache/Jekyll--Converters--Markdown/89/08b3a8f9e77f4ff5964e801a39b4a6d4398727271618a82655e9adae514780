  <li>Good question :-)</li>
  <li>I switched to a Surface Book laptop running Windows from OS X and Iâ€™m still alive :-) Both now have great Linux / Unix / BSD command lines :-)</li>
  <li>I guess all I need is a Unix command line that runs R, R Studio, ruby, python and Chromebook has one so I could switch to a Chromebook.</li>
  <li>Switching to an iPad would be more difficult since there is no built-in Unix command line (but I suppose i could ssh to a server?!? Awkward but many others have used iPads that way!</li>
  <li>It would be nice if Firefox was supported 100% on a Chromebook but Iâ€™m not holding my breath. How popular are Chromebooks? Never say never :-)</li>

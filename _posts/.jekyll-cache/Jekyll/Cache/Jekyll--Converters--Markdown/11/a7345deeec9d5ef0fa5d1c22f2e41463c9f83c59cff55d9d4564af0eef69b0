<ul>
  <li>Just like blogging everybody does it because it’s once again popular like you know back in the naughty naughts i.e. the 2000s.</li>
  <li>But just like blogging, you gotta really love it to sustain it and you gotta do the work, vlogging, blogging, podcasting, etc etc become hard (but fun :-) !) work akin to an artist’s daily practice over time! And not everybody can be popular, influential or perfect like NPR and CBC so if that’s what you are in for you will exit just like the podcasters did in the 2000s.</li>
  <li>Hope I’m wrong :-)</li>
  <li>But I think I’m not; I think voice, video, text, pictures will just be content types for everyone’s personal published stuff and few people will do it on any sort of regular schedule or artistic practice and that’s ok!</li>

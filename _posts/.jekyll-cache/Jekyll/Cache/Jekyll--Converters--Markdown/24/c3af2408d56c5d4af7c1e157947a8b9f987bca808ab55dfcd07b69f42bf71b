    <p>UPDATE: I see that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTqkdc2sl1g">Instamic just (in July) got the ability to stream using bluetooth aka Handsfree microphone profile (HFP) microphone but it only works with one app, Pro Movie App</a> , hopefully <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/01/p1-voice-record-pro-records-stereo-through-ios-lightning-port/">Voice Record Pro</a> will upgrade their iOS app to support this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Yesterdayâ€™s <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/15/p1-instamic-wave-instamic-microblog/">convoluted workflow post to make a podcast using Instamic and a laptop</a> was because I couldnâ€™t see a way to read the WAV files stored on a USB drive like the bluetooth microphone Instamic does from iOS (even though there is an Instamic remote control iOS app) so I had to resort to using a laptop (OS X or Windows or Linux it doesnâ€™t matter because you need to read the files).</li>
  <li>But wait maybe there is a way with the <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/529159/how-to-use-a-usb-drive-with-files-on-ios/">FileBrowser iOS app and certain usb drives</a> and/or the <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/508611/how-to-use-external-storage-with-your-ipad-or-iphones-files-app/">Filebrowser iOS app with the USB drive connected to your router</a>.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s silly that you canâ€™t just use the built-in iOS Files app! Câ€™mon Apple!</li>
  <li>3 days ago I <a href="https://instamic.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/8722">filed an Instamic Support request</a>:</li>

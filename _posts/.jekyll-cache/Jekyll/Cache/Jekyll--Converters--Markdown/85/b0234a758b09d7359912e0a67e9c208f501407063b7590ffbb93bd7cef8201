<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

When, one day, a translation engine crafts an artistic novel in verse in English, using precise rhyming iambic tetrameter rich in wit, pathos, and sonic verve, then Iâ€™ll know itâ€™s time for me to tip my hat and bow out.

  <li>Amen! and that day doesnâ€™t look like it will happen without a breakthrough. Neural networks and the other brute force techniques wonâ€™t get us there. Good enough for Go and Chess, not good enough for â€œC3P0-styleâ€ fluency and understanding.</li>
  <li>I think that breakthrough (quantum computers? ) will come in my lifetime but what do I know :-) ?</li>

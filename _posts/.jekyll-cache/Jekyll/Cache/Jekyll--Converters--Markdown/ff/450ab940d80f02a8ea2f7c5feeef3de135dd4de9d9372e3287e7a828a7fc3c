  <li>â€œIn <em>Cultural Analytics</em>, Lev Manovich presents concepts and methods  for computational analysis of cultural data, with a particular focus on  visual media. Drawing on more than a decade of research and projects  from his own lab, Manovichâ€”the founder of the field of cultural  analyticsâ€”offers a gentle, nontechnical introduction to selected key  concepts of data science and discusses the ways that our society uses  data and algorithms.â€ &lt; â€”â€“ Canâ€™t wait for <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-analytics">Lev Manovichâ€™s Cultural Analytics</a> which should be 100% applicable to my hobby of making tshirts and leggings from flickr data</li>

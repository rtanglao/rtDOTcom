<ul>
  <li>perspectives in 1 context doesnâ€™t necessarily travel well
-vp of nlii for 6 years, nlii founded in 1994
-founded on conviction that tech has potential to transform education
-no longer arguing on how powerful tech is
-provocative side, question conventional wisdom
-course is not the container
-teaching space is not a physical place
-learning and teching are changing, so is cogntiion
-personal doesnâ€™t mean in person means responsiveness
-tech decisions are teaching and learning decisions
-should the technologists be making the decisions
-tech works in context AND changes context
-new roles, rules and rlationships
-support services need to be scalable, sustainable
-and they are not, only work 1:1
-this is everybodyâ€™s concern
-parable of Burnsey, the Californian dog
-Burnsie Phenomenon
-only feels safe and content following the well marked trail
-feels fully justified in attacking those who threaten his comfort zone
-sacred myths and social contracts influence</li>
</ul>

<p>Myths
-tools are the solution
-tools are not the solution - just as much of a myth</p>
<ul>
  <li>we are communicating, lack a shared framework for discussions about tech and context
-this does not apply to my institution
â€”did workshop for 12 institutionsâ€™ leadership team e.g. â€œour students want face to face with our faculty who are the bestâ€
-it may apply to my institution but it certainly doesnâ€™t apply to me
-expections are rational ; higher ed should meet expectations
â€“even they expect to sit in a lecture because thatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to be!
-transformation will happen but itâ€™s not my job!
â€“if the president/cio buys in then it will be taken care of</li>
</ul>

<p>Academics</p>
<ul>
  <li>detailed focus, contained world</li>
  <li>e.g. wireless, why wouldnâ€™t it change everything it around us</li>
  <li>the rules
â€“ what is a course when learning takes place outside of contained space
â€“what about course approval guidelines
â€“what about hybrid courses?
â€“credit hour definitions
â€“tacit social contracts
â€“timing issues - students doing homework while you are lecturing
â€“blending of boundaries
â€“sense of companies, digital natives form virtual communities of practise
â€“policy = we qre 1 campus community but tech enables communities around interests, discipline communities
â€“definition and relation to communities changes
-agents
â€“we are all learners
â€“we are all teachers in this new environment
â€“tech changes power relationship - destabilizing and threatening
â€“it is important for people to feel safe
â€“people who adopt tech can be threatened and be a threat
â€“equilibrium is destabilized because of assumptions from traditional norms canâ€™t continue to apply
â€“need leaders to support and lead and enable this change
â€“need all participants to understand why destabilizing and commit to alignment to new equilibrium
-higher eductaion expects logical, incremental adoption
-political process occurs as if this doesnâ€™t work (Burnsie: want to stay in comfort zone)
-medieval goverance with an agrarian timeline!
-anti techs want techs to be viewed as â€œthose who are pushing technologyâ€</li>
</ul>

<p>New Media, New Academy, what can we do?</p>
<ul>
  <li>we working in a complicated sociotechnological context
â€“ good, slick, easy to use doesnâ€™t mean people will use it</li>
  <li>need broad awareness
â€“ how can tech fit in peopleâ€™s comfort zone? scenarios help! story of how it fits for them</li>
  <li>need to be open to new structures and funding models
-need instructional design pros</li>
  <li>new relationships - the importance of collaboration
-e.g. University of Wisconsin (? not sure if she said Wisconsin!) - norm is not 3 hour lecture, but is a blended
â€“support people overwhelmed with 1:1 support, developed a blended mode course to teach faculty, do it by department
â€“universityâ€™s goals are aligned because president puts money where mouth is
â€“ have to be able to communicate w/people on how to move them forward keeping them safe
-accountability
â€“what do have to do next rather than why it didnâ€™t work</li>
</ul>

<p>Scenarios</p>

<p>-powerful, because they allow people to fit themselves into place
-the power of prose - going back to something everybody understands</p>

<p>Standards</p>

<p>2008 - Life long learning for anyone anywhere anytime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<ul>
  <li>as always need context</li>
  <li>feedback from audience - timeline too soon!</li>
</ul>

<p>Myth of the Century</p>

<p>The ONLY way to preserve academic values is NOT to change</p>

<p>If we donâ€™t change, the something will replace higher education as we know it!</p>

<p>Question from Uli</p>

<p>-older generation educated to be individual shining stars
-todayâ€™s students are team oriented - take it for granted, have a different way of dealing with knowledge, vet it with 16 of their best friends from around the world before it putting it forward
-donâ€™t mind exposing ideas
-older people educated to hold things close to our vest</p>

<p>From the audience</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deans are competing</li>
  <li>agents who should be leaders of change are actually resistant</li>
  <li>have to work around them</li>
  <li>leaders are threatened by collaboration which means sharing resources</li>
</ul>

<p>Another person</p>

<p>title should beâ€When Traditional Budgeting models meet merging technolgiesâ€</p>

<p>Carole</p>

<p>-if leadership cadre canâ€™t trust or work together, then it wonâ€™t happen</p>

<p>Itâ€™s everybody - everybody can make scenarios
-draws out whatâ€™s important
The business about feeling safe is very important.
Tenure can be threatened by using new tech.</p>

<p>Another person</p>

<p>Other structural problems</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have to change students who expect individual not collaborative grades</li>
  <li>tenure allows people to resist tech</li>
  <li>need admins and faculty too</li>
</ul>

<p>Humiliation is a strong motivator</p>
<ul>
  <li>canâ€™t engage 18 year olds with a lecture</li>
</ul>

<p>Student</p>

<p>We like collaboration but hate group work.</p>

Thanks to fellow <a href="http://womhelsinki08.pbwiki.com/FrontPage">Nokia Open Lab 2008</a> participant, <a href="http://www.gisuser.com/">Glenn Letham,</a> for the <a href="http://www.lbszone.com/content/view/3932/2/">Nokia Bicycle Cradle</a>. Got it on Wed, mounted it on the bike yesterday and have done lots of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157609895682148/">photos</a> and a few videos (one is embedded below). It seems the Nokia Bicycle Cradle was designed for GPS tracking, specifically for <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/main/index.do">Nokia Sports Tracker</a> and <a href="http://web.nseries.com/nseries/nokiavine/">viNes</a> but with a bit of jury rigging it's a fun tool for taking videos and photos from the handlebars of your bicycle (albeit with a not too useful view of your wheel and the road; it would be superb if we could tilt it really high or if the cradle was re-designed for on the bicycle video and photo taking). Apparently this handy cradle is NOT generally available. C'mon Nokia make this cool accessory available to all please! (And if anybody knows a similar thing for the iPhone please let me know!)

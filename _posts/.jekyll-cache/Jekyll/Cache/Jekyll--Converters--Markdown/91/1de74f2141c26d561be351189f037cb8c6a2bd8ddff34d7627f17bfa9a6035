<p><a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2009/03/06/exclusive-nokia-e71-text-art-app-turns-your-words-into-mms-art/">Text art </a>is part of the <a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/e71">Nokia Beautiful Connections (this URL does not rock, IMHO it should be something like nokia.com/beautiful-connections)</a> project. It draws your text onto a algorithmically generated graphic (see above pic for an example). It's cool but wouldn't it be cooler if the art that was generated was rooted in the GPS coordinates and the place, e.g. if you were in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park">Stanley Park</a>, it drew art based on algorithms written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Salish">Salish</a> aboriginals?</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I recently had the privilege of being commissioned by Wieden + Kennedy to creating an artwork for Nokia‚Äôs new smartphone E71. It‚Äôs a new model featuring a full QWERTY keyboard, and is intended to function as a complete communication platform for people on the move. As a response to this purpose, W+K‚Äôs campaign focused on the idea of ‚ÄúBeautiful Connections‚Äù.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My contribution was a mobile app that allows the user to type in a short SMS-style message, which is then used as the basis for a generative animation that results in a visual compositions of curling forms. The final image can then be sent to other users as a MMS or saved to the phone memory for use as a wallpaper.</p>

I"<p><a href="http://bambuser.com">Bambuser</a> (<a href="http://alpha.bambuser.com/channel/roland">my archived videocasts</a>) is another competitor to qix and flixwagon. It's out of Sweden.</p>
<p>Observations after a couple of 'casts:</p>
<ol><li>Back end site is Drupal</li><li>You can download the flash video unlike the current versions of qix and flixwagon</li><li>You can select the quality and the size up to 640x480 unlike qix and flixwagon although qix supposedly will have this feature soon.</li><li>Does not seem to have a "stop streaming but keep uploading feature", only connect and disconnect</li><li>Current version seems to be slower and more jerky than the qix and flixwagon</li><li>It's out of Sweden</li></ol>
<p><br /> Check out my "Bambuser"-cast after the jump.</p>

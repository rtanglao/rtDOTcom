<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote> 
    
But what is so exhausting for me personally is that there is so often not a reciprocity of empathy from the other side of the discussion. Frankly, what I experience often is a startling lack of professionalism from community members, a standard of conduct which - while not below the bare minimum of appropriate behavior set by our Code of Conduct - I cannot imagine would be acceptable as a manner of communication to a colleague in a workplace.

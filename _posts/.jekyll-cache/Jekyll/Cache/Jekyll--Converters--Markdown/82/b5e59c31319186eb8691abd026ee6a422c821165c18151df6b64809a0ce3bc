<p>(<a href="https://github.com/Pomax/pomax.github.io/issues/1">Forked from pomaxâ€™s issue</a>; thanks Pomax!) and if you want, <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/rtDOTcom/issues/2">check out the issue on github</a> :-) recursive :-) !!!!</p>

<p>Leaving a comment on github is pretty easy if you have ever created a new userid and left a comment on the web before :-).  My apologies if this isnâ€™t easy for you!</p>

<p>Yes, you need to log in, but if you really care about that comment you wanted to leave, that shouldnâ€™t be much of a problem. I decided to go with github issues because if you just want a throwaway comment, you can always Tweet to me (@ mention @rtanglao on twitter)  about it and we can both count on that interaction losing traction and being forgotten by everyone in about a day. Thatâ€™s fine, we should be able to have those interactions, just not on the blog itself.</p>

<p>If you want to leave a real comment, one that requires meaningful and direct interaction between you and me (say you a found glaring problem with one of the thing I posted, or you have information that you think would help me update a post or write a new one, or you have real questions after reading a post and need additional information), then this is a much better place to have a conversation that can guide real change to my posts.</p>

<p>Get an account if you donâ€™t have one (itâ€™s free), and then file a new issue about what you want to talk about - Iâ€™ll try to respond the same day, because if you care enough to comment, I certainly care enough to engage with you.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>p.s. Why github? Because itâ€™s fast, updated and has features to lock issues if people sp*m them. And itâ€™s a real business with a real business model (charging software developers for private software repositories)  unlike the other commenting systems</p>

I"~<p> Blogging them since otherwise they will get lost in the non transparent <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/">Globe and Mail</a> dustbin of history :-)! And by the way, I *do* like the Globe and Mail and can&#39;t see myself stopping my print subscription, just think of these as constructive criticisms. </p>
<ul> <li>I don&#39;t like <a href="http://www.leahmclaren.ca/">Leah McLaren</a>&#39;s writing</li> <li>I don&#39;t like partial text RSS - the teasers in the current Globe RSS feeds aren&#39;t that great.</li> <li>I don&#39;t like the fact that print subscribers don&#39;t have full text access to the archive and advance access to future issues. </li><li>A long as I am a print subscriber I should have access to full text RSS feeds (with tasteful, relevant ads if you must!) and the entire archive of the Globe and Mail (or at the very least since I have been a print subscriber since 1998, I should get a 75% discount for access to the archive - the Globe doesn&#39;t reward loyal subscribers in any way which is not a way to nurture a community of lifelong subscribers.)</li> <li>Please stop your telemarketers from calling me every four months and asking me if I am interested in a New York Times subscription; I love the NYT but I am not interested ! If I was, I&#39;d contact them directly.</li> <li>Please get rid of all content from The Economist, NYT, etc and minimize the wire service stuff. I am interested in content from the Globe&#39;s writers not re-purposed stuff from other publications.</li> <li>Please implement <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/04/23/tvNewsOfTheFuture.html">Checkbox News</a>. Wouldn&#39;t it be great if I could click a checkbox that says &quot;No more from Leah McLaren&quot; or no more about Rush :-) ? Seriously it would be great and would drive adoption of your online service.  </li> </ul>

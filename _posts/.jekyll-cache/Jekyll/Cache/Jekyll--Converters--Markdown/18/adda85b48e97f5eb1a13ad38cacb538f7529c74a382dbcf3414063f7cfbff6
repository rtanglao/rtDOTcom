  <li>I think Chuq is right (see <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/04/07/p1-blogs-and-rss-are-dead-but-since-nothing-to-sell-no-email-newsletter/">Agree with Chuq! The blog is dead and so is RSS  but since i’m not trying to sell you anything (yet) i will continue to  blog, generate RSS &amp; not have an email newsletter #ymmv  #doWhatMakesYouHappyAndGivesYouThe’Engagement’YouSeek :-)</a> ) and so is Garret’s <a href="https://dangerousmeta.rocks/blog/2020/4/10/blogging-is-dead">“Blogging is dead.”</a> .

      <li>“As I’ve expressed elsewhere, when swimming in the sea of your own  blogging enjoyment, you simply must pop that head up and look around,  see where the winds and currents are heading. If you do not, your  audience will pass you by without a moment’s regret.”</li>
      <li>If you care about your audience then G is right; I don’t care about my “audience”. I just have a compulsive need to blog !!!!</li>
      <li>Regardless G’s blog, dangerousmeta.rocks is a must subscribe / must read!</li>

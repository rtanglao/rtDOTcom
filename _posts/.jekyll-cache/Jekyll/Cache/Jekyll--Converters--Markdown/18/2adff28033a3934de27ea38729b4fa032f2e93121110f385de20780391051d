I"~<p>I am glad that the <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>  folks have decided to focus on: ‚Äúthe best way to store, share, sort your photos online‚Äù</p>

<p>Here are my lightly edited notes from <a href="http://sylloge.com/personal/2004/05/im-speaking-twice-this-month-at.html">Stewart‚Äôs f<em>cking talk about designing Flickr last Thursday:&lt;/a&gt;
Stewart‚Äôs f</em>cking presentation</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>‚Äúgroupware for play‚Äù is Ludicorp‚Äôs motto</li>
  <li>hard to raise money in fall 2003 for massive multi-player gaming</li>
  <li>started as a way to raise money, now solves a problem with digital photos</li>
  <li>rating people made sense in GNE</li>
  <li>flickr original im/photo sharing</li>
  <li>first mistake - this is neat, what is it : friendster + im + photo sharing</li>
  <li>no clear idea what you want to do makes designing hard</li>
  <li>eric flash developer who lives in NY started sending pictures of kids</li>
  <li>these photos turned into magical, shared experience</li>
  <li>hard to stumble onto friends on Flickr because old version required
you to be logged on at the same time!</li>
  <li>8 weeks from decision to initial launch</li>
  <li>administrivia mostly - colo, load balancer install</li>
  <li>1999: upfront categorization of web done by human beings (yahoo) but rather links (google) worked</li>
  <li>2004: google‚Äôs approach validated and successful, yahoo‚Äôs far less so!</li>
  <li>link is human value judgement</li>
  <li>got first digital camera in 99, now has 5000 pictures</li>
  <li>mostly organized by time</li>
  <li>most common method is albums (artifact of old film paradigm)</li>
  <li>work well with 2 or 8 or 15</li>
  <li>after a certain point, it doesn‚Äôt work, have to remember where</li>
  <li>unless you are anal :-)</li>
  <li>Stewart stores everything on desktop which he periodically archives</li>
  <li>old Flickr (OF) couldn‚Äôt change title of photos because you were worried about people re-titling it offensively</li>
  <li>or url wouldn‚Äôt work so they didn‚Äôt allow public to change to private and vice versa</li>
  <li>OF couldn‚Äôt delete photos because of 404 error fear</li>
  <li>OF:friendster with chat, photo with chat, no focus!</li>
  <li>there is no maxim</li>
  <li>because you wouldn‚Äôt build something without knowing what you were building</li>
  <li>when did u figure out you wwere going to be photo sharing?</li>
  <li>6 weeks ago!</li>
  <li>if u can ‚Äòt articulate clearly and quickly what the product is, you are in trouble</li>
  <li>OF:live component was over emphasized</li>
  <li>OF:couldn‚Äôt see photos unless you were online at the same time as the person sharing</li>
  <li>meta data input should be collaborative and fun</li>
  <li>people should be able to add bits when it occurs to them</li>
  <li>not just when I add the photo but also when others look at them</li>
  <li>the best way to store, share, sort your photos online</li>
  <li>next set of features: groups and group photos</li>
  <li>private groups are twice as active</li>
  <li>just like 1/3 of TypePad blogs are private</li>
  <li>they used flash in order to re-use GNE base</li>
  <li>90% of server stuff from GNE</li>
  <li>60% client stuff from GNE</li>
  <li>GNE prototype was in DHTML</li>
  <li>changed to use Flash - none had ever worked with Flash before</li>
  <li>live socket open to server - can get/receive info via scripts over HTTP</li>
  <li>using Flash 6 - 98% of browsers have it</li>
  <li>price: very cheap! 5 dollars (American or Canadian? ) a month no bandwidth limits</li>
  <li>building upload apps so you can upload outside the browser</li>
  <li>windows only app</li>
  <li>bookmarklet</li>
</ul>

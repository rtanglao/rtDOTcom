<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

This post is a lay-person’s introduction to our new paper, which shows how to classify documents automatically with both higher accuracy and less data requirements than previous approaches. We’ll explain in simple terms: natural language processing; text classification; transfer learning; language modeling; and how our approach brings these ideas together. If you’re already familar with NLP and deep learning, you’ll probably want to jump over to our NLP classification page for technical links.

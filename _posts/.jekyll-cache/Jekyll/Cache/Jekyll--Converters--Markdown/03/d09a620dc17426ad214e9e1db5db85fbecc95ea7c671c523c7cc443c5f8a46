Hurray! Now sharing WiFi with the world! Couldn't get it to work with my hub like the ancient Airport Base Station does which makes no sense. If I plug it directly into the ADSL modem it works, just doesn't work plugged in indirectly like the Airport Base Station was! Do I need a cross over eithernet cable to make it work with my hub? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other quirks: maybe this is a bug in Apple's Airport but sometimes the router works but doesn't show as connected. Also, it took forever (more than 5 minutes!) for FON_AP to show up as a WiFi network after plugging in the router. Finally, the registration webapp on the site wouldn't accept my street address as valid. I had to manually move to my location on the Google map to make it accept my address. Weird! &lt;/p&gt;</p>

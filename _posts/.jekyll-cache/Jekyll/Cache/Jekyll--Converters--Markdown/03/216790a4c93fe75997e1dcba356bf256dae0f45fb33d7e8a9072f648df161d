  <li>Inspired by my previous post from April 21, 2019 : <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/04/21/p1-mrstardacted/">Idea: make a tshirt with the m*eller report  r*dacted with 50% of the thumbnails on front and 50% on back and call it  of course ‘mrstardacted’</a></li>
  <li>Text thumbnails of open source contributions as art for the win :-) (I’d make my thumbnails pink on white instead of black on white naturally or maybe even white on pink)</li>
</ul>

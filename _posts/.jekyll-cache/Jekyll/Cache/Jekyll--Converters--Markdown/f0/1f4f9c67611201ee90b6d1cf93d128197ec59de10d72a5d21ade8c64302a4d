Is serious about taking the non serious side of blogging seriously.</p>

<p>e.g. his personal blog has a guest blogger - a stuffed moose :-) !</p>

<p>Weblogging is not journalism necessarily but it could be.</p>

<p>Duty of Care for journalists:
-first hand research
-multiple sources
-different perspectives
-verify sources
-editorial process
-fact versus opinion</p>

<p>Blogs on the other hand</p>
<ul>
  <li>second hand data</li>
  <li>one source</li>
  <li>one perspective</li>
  <li>no verification (combined with RSS ‚Äòsnowball effect‚Äô makes blogs a great rumour mill)</li>
  <li>instant publishing (my opinion that instant publishing is needed because you need the immediate first reaction AND it‚Äôs also good to have the considered, reflective opinion later)</li>
  <li>mix of fact and opinion (my opinion is that at least blogs are upfront about it unlike newspapers which have more opinion than they state up front)</li>
</ul>

<p>Weblog = direct access point/connection point for new sources</p>

<p>Blogs not being journalism is a good thing but still a mass media revolution</p>

<p>We love them because they are different.</p>

<p>What is news? What should it become?</p>

<p>Still hierarchical - others make decisions</p>

<p>Media content traditionally is about those who make decisions</p>

<p>Media covers ‚Äúimportant‚Äù rather than ordinary</p>

<p>Focused on political and social ‚Äúelites‚Äù</p>

<p>Internet is more democratic (potentially)</p>

<p>Undemocratic access - not everybody has Internet access but a lot more do.</p>

<p>But that‚Äôs still easier than starting your own TV station.</p>

<p>Weblogs make it even easier.</p>

<p>The power to publish.</p>

<p>Moving from news that is relevant to the world to news that is relevant to me.</p>

<p>People are looking for media content that has emotional involvement</p>

<p>Looking for Gossip.</p>

<p>Content doesn‚Äôt have to make sense.</p>

<p>Weblogs aren‚Äôt supposed to be about the truth</p>

<p>One person‚Äôs point of view (distorted point of view but that‚Äôs not a bad thing)</p>

<p>Weblogs are a mosaic of everyday life.  (Roland‚Äôs note- cool slogan)</p>

<p>Are you serious about expressing yourself?</p>

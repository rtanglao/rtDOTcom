I"¦<p>Apply today! We want new voices as well as speakers from previous years with cool ideas. And you don't have to be a talking head! It can be a hands on training session, discussion or whatever makes sense! Please submit your idea today. The deadline is Tuesday November 15th.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">Speaker Submission | Northern Voice 2006</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>To apply to become a speaker at NorthernVoice, complete the form below. In the Bio section, provide relevant background information that explains why you would be a good speaker for this conference. We're not necessarily looking for vast public speaking or punditry experience--we just want to get a sense of who you are and how you'd fit into our program.
</p>
<p>We intend to divide the day between presentations and discussion sessions. The presentations will be traditional seminars, with one or more speakers speaking on a particular aspect of weblogs and personal publishing. The discussion sessions will be open-mike "teach-ins", where facilitators will lead a group conversation on a blogging-related topic.</p></blockquote>

How about doing the following now (Lazy Web and <a href="http://anarkystic.com/blog/">Andy</a> and whoever wants to participate):
<br />Write a Python or Java app that does the following
<br />1. Prompts for a title
<br />2. For each image in the default camera image folder, it uploads them to <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> using their <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/upload.api.html">photo upload API</a>
</p>
<p>
Pretty simple and pretty dumb but I've learned that if you can't do the simple stuff, you are "stuffed". So if anybody wants to code this for me :-) or post some code that does this, I would be grateful and I will take it from there (and post updates here).

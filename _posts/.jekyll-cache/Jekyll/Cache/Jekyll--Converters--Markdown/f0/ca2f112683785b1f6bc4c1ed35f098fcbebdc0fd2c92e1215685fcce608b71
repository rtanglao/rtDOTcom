I"Ö<p><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/12/23/my_merry_christmas_publicast_and_some_predictions_for_2005">2005, the year of making money off blogs and RSS</a> continues.  Congrats to <a href="http://www.wingedpig.com/">Mark</a>. I haven't been a big fan of Ask Jeeves! in the past but maybe this acquisition and the start of their <a href="http://blog.ask.com/">blog</a> means things are changing for the better.  I would also re-iterate my advice of not keeping your confidential RSS subscriptions in a centralized aggregator like Bloglines no matter who owns them.

<blockquote><p>That's the scoop. Ask Jeeves is integrating Bloglines into their search system (it's not yet live on their main site, til Monday as reported).
</p>
<p>Noted however that on Ask Jeeves new blog (it's a baby, three days old!) at the top, blog search, and the sidebar, Top Blogs and Most Popular Links go straight to Bloglines.
</p>
<p>So Mark Fletcher will be their newest employee starting Monday. Congratulations, Mark and Bloglines! Oh, and welcome to the blogosphere, Jeeves!</p></blockquote>

<ol> <li><a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">Speaker Submissions</a>: The <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/news/2006/11/27/speaker-submission-date-extended-to-dec-1">Deadline has been extended to December 1st as Lauren wrote</a>. You don&#39;t have to be famous or a professional conference presenter: we&#39;re looking for both fresh and experienced voices who wish to present or chair a panel on topics related to the blog-o-sphere, videoblogging, podcasting, virtual worlds like Second life, the two way web/read write web/web 2.0, blogging 101, podcasting 101, etc. It&#39;s all about the abstract. If it&#39;s well written and topical, your chances will be much higher. <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">Submit today</a>!</li> <li><a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/register">Registration</a> is open now! Pre-register and save $10. That&#39;s right it&#39;s only $30 for a single day and $50 for both days as opposed to $40 for one day and $60 for both days at the door. I bet we&#39;ll sell out like last year so pre-registration is recommended. <a href="http://2007.northernvoice.ca/register">Register now</a>!</li> </ol>

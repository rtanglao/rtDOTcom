<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Big Blue has announced software that allows companies to deliver Web applications from a server to desktops, notebooks, and PDAs.

Workplace Client Technology, part of IBM's Lotus Workplace strategy, is seen as a competitive offering to Microsoft's Office suite, which runs only on Windows and Macintosh operating systems.

IBM software head Steve Mills outlined at a press event in New York Monday how the Workplace platform can be used as a hub to deliver to end users a variety of applications that are centrally managed on servers, including applications from Microsoft's Office suite.

Using this technology, users can access e-mail, word processing, spreadsheet, and database products on a server even though those programs are not installed on their own computer. Running the Lotus Workplace applications from a server, and not on the desktop, gives workers access to their personal suite of applications and data no matter where or what device they access it from.</blockquote>

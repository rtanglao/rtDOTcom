  <li>Always surprises me how many people ask vague questions on support forums, or on twitter, reddit, etc. Nobody can read your mind :-) !!!!</li>
  <li>What you did, what you expected, what happened, your requirements &lt;—- if you can concisely state these things, then you are much more likely to get some response! and if not at least you have a more clarity around the issue which is always useful! &lt;– See <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/30/writingGoodBugReports.html">writing good bug reports</a></li>
  <li>I know this requires effort  but it’s 100% worth it! And yes not everything is a bug report or software requirements  but this is a great framework for questions on the internet in general and for software improvements</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add corrections</strong> in the home feeds of those who reacted to it, which helps inform  readers so they may adjust what they feel about the poster and may  become better informed</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Add a way to forgive the poster</strong> for those who reacted, which creates an incentive to admit mistakes in  the future, and helps repair any relationship damage between people‚Äù &lt;‚Äì Love this idea from <a href="https://nickpunt.com/blog/deescalating-social-media/">Nick Punt::De-Escalating Social Media Designing humility and forgiveness into social media products</a></p>

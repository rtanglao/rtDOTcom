  <li>To follow up from yesterdayâ€™s Know Roaming post, <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/20/p1-know-roaming-highly-recommended/">Know Roaming Sim Sticker for Canadians - highly recommended</a>, you can use euro-roaming if you have a European address. So use KR for the first day, and then get a SIM mailed to your European address?!?! I guess this only works for long visits, i.e. longer than 2 weeks where you actually have a European address where you can receive mail.</li>

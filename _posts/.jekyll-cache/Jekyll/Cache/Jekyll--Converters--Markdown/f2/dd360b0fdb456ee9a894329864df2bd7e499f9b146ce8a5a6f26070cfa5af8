I"˜<p>Ha! Laugh out loud as they say! Programming well like doing anything well is hard and anybody, even Republicans can learn to program (just like I painfully taught myself how to assemble Ikea furniture :-) !).  But not everybody can put together and design great software just like not everybody can write design great furniture.</p>

<p>So anybody who thinks all programmers are just equal units that can be shuffled around and tries to manage programmers that way is doomed to failure or worse mediocrity.</p>

<p>From  <a href="http://dev.r.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2004/3/25/29518.html">Dijkstra paper in his own handwriting: Why American Computing Science Seems Incurable‚Äù</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote> In the essay, Dijkstra argues that the pressures that the high-tech industry is adversely affecting academic research. He says that industry pressure is causing the definition of being a good programmer to change from someone who is "able to design more effective and trustworthy programs" and who knows "how to do it efficiently" to somewho who thinks of "'industrial acceptance' as quality criterion" and writes programs such that "its main feature [is] that one could apply it unthinkingly." Programming, he says is becoming less a branch of applied math and more a branch of keeping the high-tech industry afloat, a problem aggravated by "a total lack of faith in [America's] educational system and a deep-rooted mistrust of intellectuals."

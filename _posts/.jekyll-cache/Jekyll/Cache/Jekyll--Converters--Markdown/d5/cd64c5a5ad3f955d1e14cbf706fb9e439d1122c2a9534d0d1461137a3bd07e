<a href="http://www.enochchoi.com/thoughts/index.html">Enoch</a> is a kind and gentle soul, a wine lover and connoisseur, foodie and a blogger.  Had a great and very relaxing pre-BloggerCon brunch with him and Michael, another med blogger, as well as with Barb and Simon.  And the he and I geeked out and went to Fry's and I bought a 1 Gigabyte compact flash card (Yes! Now I can take 400 4 megapixel images at the highest resolution on my Canon S400).

<p><a href="http://www.hopstudios.com/nep/column/">Travis</a> and I talked about <a href="/rt/roland/tags/blurry">my many blurry photos on Flickr</a> while <a href="http://www.hopstudios.com/nep/column/chicago_business_trip.html">we were in Chicago</a>. My solution is a digital SLR sometime before 2006. His solution was a better point and shoot because he thinks I need a compact camera. And although we both love Canon and hate the proprietary Sony memory stick, at the moment only Sony has the combination of fast auto focus (i.e. less blurry) and a  full 640x480 video mode in a compact point and shoot form factor. Boris' <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canons1is/">Canon S1 IS</a> has an awesome zoom and  video mode but still has the blurry photo problem.</p>

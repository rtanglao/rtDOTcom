I"Ã<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Browser based see + cloud storage + simple web hosting for that cloud storage = 21st websites for everyone!</p>

<ul>
  <li>This site, rolandtanglao,com, uses a command line static website generator called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> written in ruby which generates HTML which I then upload to the free static website hosting service <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">surge.sh</code></li>
  <li>This is great <strong>for me</strong>. Since command lines, ruby et al are my friends since 1984 :-) ! (i first used the Unix command line in 1984 or maybe a year or 2 earlier not sure!)</li>
  <li>But itâ€™s dumb, why couldnâ€™t I do this in a web browser?</li>
  <li>Make it so lazy web :-)</li>
  <li>Anyhow this isnâ€™t an original idea.</li>
  <li>Dave Winerâ€™s been riffing on this for ages and <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/01/05/itsTimeToThinkOfTheUsers.html">hereâ€™s a quote from his most recent thinking on browser static site generation plus uploading to static site cloud hosting</a>:</li>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

Here's a sketch of how the service would work.<br />

   1. Start with a user-facing service like Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon Cloud Drive. <br />
    
   2. Add an API that allows a JavaScript app running in the browser to write into a folder in a user's space. The user grants access via oAuth, as they do with Twitter, Facebook, etc. <br />
    
   3. Connect to a registrar to allow a user to associate a domain name with a folder. Or map a domain they register elsewhere. A revenue opportunity.

  <li>Read  the whole thing (subject to Mediumâ€™s ridiculous paywall :-) #ymmv ): <a href="https://medium.com/work-futures/some-feedback-about-feedback-be02d84dd903">Stowe Body Some Feedback About Feedback</a></li>
  <li>I especially like these table entries:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Here are three things that really worked for me. What was going through your mind when you did them?</strong> Instead of â€œGood Jobâ€!</li>
      <li><strong>Hereâ€™s what I would do</strong>. Instead of â€œHereâ€™s what you should doâ€</li>
      <li><strong>When you did x, I felt y or I didnâ€™t get that.</strong> Instead of â€œThat didnâ€™t really work.â€</li>
      <li><strong>Hereâ€™s exactly where you started to lose me.</strong> Instead of â€œYou need to improve your communications skillsâ€</li>
      <li><strong>Iâ€™m struggling to understand your plan</strong>. Instead of â€œYou lack strategic thinkingâ€</li>
      <li><strong>When I donâ€™t hear from you, I worry that weâ€™re not on the same page.</strong> Instead of â€œYou need to be more responsiveâ€</li>
      <li><strong>Hereâ€™s my reaction.</strong> Instead of â€œCan I give you some feedback?â€</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

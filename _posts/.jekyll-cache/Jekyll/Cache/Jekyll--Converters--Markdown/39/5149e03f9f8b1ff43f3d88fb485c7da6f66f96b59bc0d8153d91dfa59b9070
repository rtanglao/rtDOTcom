<ul>
  <li>Like <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/07/p1-s7-edge-died/">my S7 Edge dying</a>, again not sure what happened.</li>
  <li>Maybe I forgot to close all the ports in my supposedly waterproof case. Maybe I didn’t mount the case properly - this is more likely!</li>
  <li>Luckily I have an iPhone 6 plus. I “downgraded” to that and all is well.</li>
  <li>Again very subtle differences that you miss. The camera is worse in low light, the touch sensor is slower and the phone in general is slower.</li>
</ul>

  <li>First they made it hard (or was it first and second and third and fourth times)</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/pricing/aaa-all">Then Twitter charged outrageous fees :-) for API access</a></li>
  <li>(I expect the above link to break the next time Twitter borks their API, the flickr API is still the gold standard!)</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s a private business they can do whatever they want. Better off blogging methinks but Iâ€™m krazy :-)</li>
  <li>I also think the black helicopters should take over twitter :-) but again Iâ€™m krazy ! Nationalize it :-) UN-takeover please!</li>

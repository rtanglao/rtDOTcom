<p>From <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca/node/view/57">New Registration Contest - Win an RCA MP3 Player</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Tod Maffin, CBC tech dude and Northern Voice speaker, has kindly donated an RCA Lyra 128 MB MP3 player for a contest. So, we're having one.</p>

<p>Everybody who registers between today, December 17 and Friday, January 7, 2005 is eligible to win the MP3 player. That's all there is to it. Shortly thereafter, we'll randomly draw one registrant's name and announce the winner right here.</p></blockquote>

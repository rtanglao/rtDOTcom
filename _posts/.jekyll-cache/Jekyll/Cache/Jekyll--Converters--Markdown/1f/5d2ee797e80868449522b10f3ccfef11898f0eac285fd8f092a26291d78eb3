<br /><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">I think the genius of Silicon Valley is that the people are actually there; not that there are cheap networking events. We have some cool people here in BC but not nearly the depth or breadth that they do in Silicon Valley. The question is how to get there from here and I don't have the answer.</span>

<br /><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">The usual thought provoker from Brendon. Perhaps we haven't thoroughly thought out the implications of Creative Commons licensing or perhaps licensing in general with respect to RSS. I think Martin S. is wrong to do what he did but there is another side.</span>

<br /><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">I am sure Drupal and the other major systems will fall in line, but as Boris says this doesn't stop people from clicking on the links!  &quot;If you're a blogger (or a blog reader), you're painfully familiar with people who try to raise their own websites' search engine rankings by submitting linked blog comments like &quot;Visit my discount pharmaceuticals site.&quot; This is called comment spam, we don't like it either, and we've been testing a new tag that blocks it. From now on, when Google sees the attribute (rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;) on hyperlinks, those links won't get any credit when we rank websites in our search results. This isn't a negative vote for the site where the comment was posted; it's just a way to make sure that spammers get no benefit from abusing public areas like blog comments, trackbacks, and referrer lists.&quot;</span>

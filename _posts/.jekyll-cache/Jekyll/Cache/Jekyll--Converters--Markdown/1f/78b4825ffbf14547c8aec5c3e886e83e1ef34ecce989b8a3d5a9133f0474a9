    <p><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/04/23/p3-loving-typora-markdown-editor/">IA Writer 1.1.7121.15952 still hangs like it did in April 2019</a> when opening  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) files. I use WSL for blogging which means my blogging workflow with IA Writer is broken and has been broken since April 2019.</p>

    <p>Luckily, I can use Typora instead. <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2015/10/14/p2-love-ia-writer/">Still love IA Writer though</a>. Time to file a support request I guess.</p>

<p>tl;dr Read what Chuq wrote and skip what I write below :-) <a href="https://chuqui.com/2016/10/thoughts-on-the-new-macbook-pros-and-apples-announcements/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://chuqui.com/2016/10/how-apple-could-have-avoided-much-of-the-controversy/">Part 2</a>, <a href="https://chuqui.com/2016/11/apples-marketing-on-one-slide/">Part 3</a>. <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/29/p1-apple-out-of-touch-unix-centric-pros/">Iâ€™m still sticking to the Mac as I wrote before</a> but do what is best for you as always :-) !!!!!!</p>

<ul>
  <li>No roadmap this is what happens. I blame Apple. Bad PR bad communications.</li>
  <li>Calling them MacBook Airs instead of MacBook Pros would have helped as somebody suggested (canâ€™t find a link!)</li>
  <li>Stop whingeing :-), start working on open source open hardware laptops or at least laptops that are closer to that ideal like <a href="https://system76.com/">System 76</a></li>
  <li>No SD Card reader is not a big deal. I use WiFi to transfer JPEGs and have at least 3 USB SD card readers and I survived importing 10,000 or more RAW photos including Fuji XE2 and X100T into Lightroom on my slow and obsolete :-) and SD card reader-less MBA.</li>
  <li>VR? Buy a Windows desktop until Apple delivers something decent. VR on a desktop is transient anyway and will soon be a thing of the past.</li>
  <li>Need to frequently and quickly compile Firefox or some crazy large piece of software thatâ€™s Mac OS X specific? Apple has clearly messed up here and  doesnâ€™t have anywhere near a current solution! Old Mac Minis and Mac Pros donâ€™t cut it.</li>
  <li>Video editing beyond prosumer? Again Apple doesnâ€™t have a solution and again you are SOL. I figure folks have really no solution except Windows or build your own system (and I wouldnâ€™t recommend a Hackintosh unless you have an Mac IT person to support you!)</li>
</ul>

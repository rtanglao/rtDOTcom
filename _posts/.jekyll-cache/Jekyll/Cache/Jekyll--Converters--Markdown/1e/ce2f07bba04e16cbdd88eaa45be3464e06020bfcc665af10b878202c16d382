<ul>
  <li>My perfect software documentation:
    <ul>
      <li>Text with lots of examples and screenshots</li>
      <li>plus tightly edited short video (no “yo dawgs subscribe to my youtube channel” or music or trailers, headers, intros, etc. or at the end no “don’t forget to click on “like” or here’s our instagram or even worse here’s our mailing list and finally again no check out my youtube channel or if you want more here are 8 other videos that are relevant” :-)).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>But I’m a crazy old geezer :-) And I realize a tightly edited short video is harder to do than a rambling stream of consciousness video (or blog post like this one, guilty :-) mea culpa!)</li>
  <li>What’s yours?</li>
</ul>

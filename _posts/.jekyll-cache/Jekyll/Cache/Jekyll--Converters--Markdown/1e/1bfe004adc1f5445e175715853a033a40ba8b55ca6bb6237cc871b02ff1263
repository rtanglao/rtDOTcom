I"¡<p>The N900 is the closest thing to my <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2009/07/02/n97-aint-my-n999-concept-its-closer">N999 vision</a> that Nokia has announced. More like this please. Still prefer a separate company/stealth division. Still really want a device that caters to&nbsp; mobile, social multi media creators like&nbsp; myself. Still want an optical zoom. Still don't need a QWERTY keyboard. Congrats, Nokia, anyway on thinking a wee bit different for a change. And good-bye to S60/S^2/whatever crazy re-branding Nokia wants to give you.. You'll always be my first mobile crush but yes I have jilted you and it will never be the same between us :-)</p>

<p>FROM the afore linked MDN page:</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
"Marionette is an automation driver for Mozilla's Gecko engine. It can remotely control either the UI or the internal JavaScript of a Gecko platform, such as Firefox. It can control both the chrome (i.e. menus and functions) or the content (the webpage loaded inside the browsing context), giving a high level of control and ability to replicate user actions. In addition to performing actions on the browser, Marionette can also read the properties and attributes of the DOM.<br /><br />


If this sounds similar to Selenium/WebDriver then you're correct! Marionette shares much of the same ethos and API as Selenium/WebDriver, with additional commands to interact with Gecko's chrome interface. Its goal is to replicate what Selenium does for web content: to enable the tester to have the ability to send commands to remotely control a user agent."

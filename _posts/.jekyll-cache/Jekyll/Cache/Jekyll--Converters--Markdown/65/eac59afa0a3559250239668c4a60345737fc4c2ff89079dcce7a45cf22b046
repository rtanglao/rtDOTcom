I"„<p>OK, just watched the demo video and read some more.</p>

<p>The MetaWeblogAPI is not supported so I can't post from <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">Marsedit</a>, <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a>, etc. Please support the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblogAPI</a> and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">the MT extensions</a> so that the hundreds of tools that work with these APIs work with MSN Spaces.
</p>
<p>And although I thought I read that MSN Spaces supported blogging via IM, it doesn't.  Pity! It would be cool for example to let the author of a blog, update via IM or to let the author's IM buddies post comments to the blog (somehow! not sure how to UI this).
</p>
<p>Finally the very smart <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=3efdb83d-e4fe-4b00-804d-f874f5cdcec0">Dare Obsanjao</a> (check out <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/carnage4life/">Dare's MSN Spaces blog</a>) is working on the back end. I am sure Dare's involvement  will result in it s*cking less much more quickly since Dare knows blogging, the MetaWeblogAPI, RSS, etc.</p>

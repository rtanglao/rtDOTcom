  <li>Not sure about the rest of the many thoughts in Kevin Kwokâ€™s <a href="https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/">The Arc of Collaboration</a> but I love Kevinâ€™s idea of â€œSlack as Else Statementâ€</li>
  <li>Not sure thereâ€™s â€œone app to rule them allâ€ :-)  I am sure that it wonâ€™t be Microsoft Teams but hey Iâ€™ve been wrong before :-) !</li>
  <li>I am sure that continuously working better to produce awesome products and services is hard, messy and will involve lots of tools all loosely coupled together by something like Slack or maybe even many apps like Slack.</li>

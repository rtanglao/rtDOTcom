  <li>Like <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/12/p1-had-to-reboot-to-get-wifi-working-on-surface-book2/">WiFi</a>, the USB gets into a funky state every so often on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 and the only way to fix it is to reboot. This works fine on Mac just like WiFi works fine on Mac. Sad but true! Shouldnâ€™t happen if the computer is made and designed by the same company that made the operating system, right :-) ?!?!</li>
  <li>Otherwise still very happy with this computer.</li>
  <li>WSL works great, screen is great, etc etc</li>

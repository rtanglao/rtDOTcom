<p>Here is the PDF of <a target="_self" href="http://www.bryght.com/sites/bryght.com/files/Blogging.pdf">my blogging talk</a> at tonight's <a href="http://vef.org/web/" target="_self">Vancouver Enterprise Forum</a> <a href="http://vef.org/web/EventDetails.asp?ProductID=86" target="_self">Web 2.0</a> Event at Science World. My co-panelists (<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/" target="_self">Paul Kedrosky</a>, <a href="http://fergusson.net/blog.html" target="_self">Michael Fergusson</a>, <a href="http://blame.ca/dick/" target="_self">Dick Hardt</a> doing his great <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/" target="_self">Identity 2.0 talk</a>, <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/" target="_self">Andr&eacute; Charland</a> and Geoff Hansen (no link since nothing shows up in Google; Geoff get a blog or something with RSS!) were great but I think Paul Kedrosky stole the show. I hope he posts his presentation but suffice to say it wasn't nearly as funny as his live presentation (<a href="http://brucesharpe.blogspot.com/" target="_self">Bruce Sharpe</a> videoed it and I hope he posts the video and audio; it's a hoot). Thanks Paul; great to meet you!<br />

    <p><a href="http://blog.mathemagenic.com/">Lilia</a>  is one of the smartest and most capable people I have met (we met in Vienna at Blogtalk 2.0 and in Seattle post 2004 but I didn’t blog about it, imagine that?) . I know  that her research and work is more valid in 2019 than ever (e.g <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/07/06/anjo-anjewierden-rogier-brussee-lilia-efimova-shared-conceptualizations-in-weblogs-blogtalk-2-0/">Anjo Anjewierden / Rogier Brussee / Lilia Efimova: “Shared Conceptualizations in Weblogs”  - BlogTalk 2.0</a>). We just have much more people doing social media!</p>

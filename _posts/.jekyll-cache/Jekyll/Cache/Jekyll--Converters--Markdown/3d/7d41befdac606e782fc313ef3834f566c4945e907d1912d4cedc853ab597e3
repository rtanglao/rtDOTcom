<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the best features of the Duet PCS has got to be the simplicity in getting it up and running, you simply plug it in. Once it is detected, fire up your VoIP client, go to the audio settings, and select the device for your output and microphone input and you are ready to talk. This worked absolutely perfect on every machine we plugged it into.

<p>I won't go as far as to say it is a "must have" in my travel case, but if I had to do without it, it would certainly be missed. At close to $200, it is a bit on the pricey side but when you add in the high quality echo cancellation and noise reduction, it does perform as good or better than some more expensive speaker phones I have used. If you are heavy VoIP user, either using a softphone PBX client, Gizmo, Skype, or IM clients, and you are looking for a business quality speaker phone, then you really can't go wrong with the Duet PCS.

  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/30/p1-300-per-year-for-up-to-date-iphone-450-a-year-for-up-to-date-android-phone/">As I blogged before (and I was wrong itâ€™s 4 years for iOS and 2 years for Android), to be secure, if you have the money buy an iPhone the year it comes out and then hold onto it for four years</a>; for Android you have to do it every 2 years i.e. <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/blog/dear-wirecutter-budget-android-phone-security-updates/">donâ€™t believe what The Wirecutter or anybody else writes about Android updates</a>.</li>
  <li>No Android phone manufacturer consistently updates their Android phones for 4 years from the date they are introduced like Apple does for 4 years from the date of introduction.</li>
  <li>And yes this is a scathing indictment of software and the mobile phone industry! Sad face but true :-)</li>
  <li>Obviously this doesnâ€™t apply if you are a phone nerd and can handle the risk of bricking your phone by applying 3rd party Android firmware (if and only if the 3rd party Android firmware gets the updates in a timely fashion for 4 years for your phone). But most people arenâ€™t phone nerds nor should they be!</li>

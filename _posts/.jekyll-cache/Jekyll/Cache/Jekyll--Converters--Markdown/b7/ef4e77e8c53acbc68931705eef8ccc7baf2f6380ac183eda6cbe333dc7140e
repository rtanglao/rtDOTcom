I":<p> I love Lightroom so much so that <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/02/26/northern-voice-2007-redux-part-1-adobe-lightroom-really-is-that-good">I am</a> a <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/25/High-End-Compact-Cameras">&#39;small e&#39; evangelist for Lightroom</a>  and hate Photoshop but like driving a car, I guess I&#39;m going to get over my loathing of Photoshop&#39;s horrendous user interface and non digital photographer oriented features and eventually buy CS3. I am still hoping that Lightroom team eventually re-imagines Photoshop! And yes, I share Tim&#39;s ambivalence about Lightroom&#39;s non open sourced nature. I think that all apps like all mainstream operating systems will eventually be built around an open source core like Mac OS X is built around BSD and how Lightroom is built around Lua and sqlite. </p>

<p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p>
<blockquote> Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve become something of an open-source triumphalist, drifting to the conclusion that (on the engineering side) it&rsquo;s the best way to build software and (on the business side) it&rsquo;s a better way to monetize it. I have to confess that Adobe Lightroom has kind of shaken my convictions. Certain elements of its UI and design (for example, the crop/rotate tool, and the nondestructive editing paradigm) are qualitative steps forward in the state of the art. Furthermore, I can&rsquo;t think of a single good business reason for Adobe to open-source it. I guess the conclusion is obvious: for the foreseeable future, both models of software building and marketing are going to march along; neither is doomed. </blockquote>

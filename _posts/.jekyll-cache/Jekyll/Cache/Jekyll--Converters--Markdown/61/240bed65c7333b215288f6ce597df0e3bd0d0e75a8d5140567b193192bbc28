<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m crazy :-) so I use Firefox 99% of the time for both work and fun; if stuff doesnâ€™t work or I need a second user, I use Safari NOT Chrome.</li>
  <li>I use Firefox on Windows 1-2 hours per day at work but my main work and fun machine is a Mac. (Iâ€™m probably going to switch my main work machine to a Windows machine (i.e. real Windows laptop from Microsoft or Lenovo or some such NOT Bootcamp on a Mac) at the end of this year because Iâ€™m crazy. I know I will hate it but sometimes itâ€™s nice to use what most other people use!)</li>
  <li>I use Chrome only 0.5% when google unintentionally or intentionally b*rks FF &amp; Safari</li>
  <li>Chrome appealed to me with its speed back in the day but since 2011 the speed difference for me has gone away enough not to matter #ymmv</li>
  <li>And even back then 2008-2011 I only used Chrome &lt;50% of the time!</li>
  <li>Plus I donâ€™t like the idea of Google knowing more about me!</li>
  <li>But honestly they can mine all my photos and my emails for advertisements, so Iâ€™m not exactly on firm moral ground here :-)</li>
  <li>Disclaimer: I donâ€™t know anything about the Firefox code or Chrome code and I work on the Firefox support team so I am biased of course :-) I also donâ€™t use E*ge on Windows because I irrationally still donâ€™t like M*crosoft. #ymmv</li>

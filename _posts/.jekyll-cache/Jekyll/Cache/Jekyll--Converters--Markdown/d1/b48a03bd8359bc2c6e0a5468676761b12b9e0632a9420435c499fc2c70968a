<p>As always inspired by Bret Victor. This time by <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">What can a technologist do about climate change?</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>I have always been intrigued by micro climate.</li>
  <li>Modelling the local climate is something that nobody does it seems to me. And we live at the top of a hill in East Vancouver so we get a wee bit more precipitation than the rest of Vancouver.</li>
  <li>Is there a citizen science movement around local climate modelling that I can tap into and learn from and contribute to?</li>
</ul>

Read <a href="http://nabandwidthnews.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/8/157261.html">the whole thing over on North American Bandwidth News</a>.  I will post a followup with what I want in a Flickr 7610 uploader later.

I bought my Nokia 7610 cameraphone for one reason: to moblog 1 megapixel photos in real time.
<br />
<br />Here was my vision; I would take photos with my cameraphone and through the magic of Fido GPRS have it automatically posted within seconds to my blog and to Flickr. No muss, no fuss moblogging! I naively figured that since blogs are not new, GPRS is not new and cameraphones are not new that somebody would have figured it out.

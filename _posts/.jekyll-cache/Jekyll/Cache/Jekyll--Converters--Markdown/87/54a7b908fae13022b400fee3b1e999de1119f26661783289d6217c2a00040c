Glad to see that they finally made the leap to public blogging!  <br />FROM <a href="http://blogs.nortel.com/2007/01/23/introduction-to-my-blog/">John Roese’s Blog » Blog Archive » Introduction to my blog</a>: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong> &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; It is with great pleasure that I begin my official weblog at Nortel. Because it is my first, I thought I’d take a bit of space to introduce myself and my philosophy and perspective in general as a way to kick off what I hope will be an on-going dialog related to technology, the telecom industry, Nortel and other assorted items of interest that I hope to share with you through this medium. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>END QUOTE</strong> &lt;/p&gt;</p>

The first in my occasional series of videoblogs where real people review smartphones. In this installment, <a href="http://zak.greant.com/">Zak Greant</a> reviews the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/spg.jsp?cc=global&amp;lc=en&amp;ver=4001&amp;template=pp1_1_1&amp;zone=pp&amp;lm=pp1&amp;pid=10376">Sony Ericsson W810i</a>. He likes it but it's still a bit rough around the edges (e.g. no real integration with iTunes or any other music player app). As an open source evangelist for <a href="http://ez.no/">eZ Systems</a> and formerly <a href="http://sxip.org/">sxip</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as well as doing work for <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla Foundation</a> and others, Zak travels a lot, so he loves the quad band.  Of course Zak bought the phone outside of Canada since it was not available in Canada at that time. Finally, come on Sony and Nokia, put standard headphone jacks in your music phones!

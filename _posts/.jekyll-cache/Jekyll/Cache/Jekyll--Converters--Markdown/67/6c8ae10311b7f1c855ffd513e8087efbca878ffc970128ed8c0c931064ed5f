<ul>
  <li>I’ve been blogging since 1999.</li>
  <li>Over 15 years! In fact over 17 years! My first blog was on Radio Userland and sadly is gone.</li>
  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/03/16/hello-world/">Then Movable Type in 2004</a>, then Drupal and now Jekyll!</li>
  <li>I have no grandious thoughts other than just do it! And I don’t plan this blog nor have I ever really planned it. I’m sure that’s obvious :-)</li>
  <li>Forcing yourself to write daily or at least periodically or at least once a week is something everybody should do for at least a year. Why? To improve your writing! Try it not for money!</li>
  <li>And if you get a chance, try it for money.</li>
  <li>Both are valid and both are equally challenging. And yes I’ve done both. I blogged professionally for Bryght 2004-2008.</li>
  <li>And it’s a YES AND ! IF you must, use somebody else’s silo like instagram or twitter or facebook or whatever the flavour of the month is in addition to blogging.</li>
</ul>

Looking forward to the next event there&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca/news/igor-faletski">Igor Faletsk</a>i's and <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca/news/john-boxall">John Boxall</a>'s <a href="http://www.mobilemonday.fi/event/global-summit-2007">MoMo World Wide Summit 2007</a> presentation was insightful and hilarious. Love how they loved the unconference part the best too. I suspect I would have too.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Handi Mobile's poll service sounds great. Please add acknowledgement message to confirm a successful vote.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The <a href="http://floobs.com/">floobs</a> aka "<a href="http://mogulus.com/">Mogulus</a> Mobile" service that they mentioned sounds great. Sign me up for the beta, Igor and John!&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Great enthusiastic organization by new WINBC Executive Director Michael Bidu. Go Michael Go! Go WINBC go!&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.ediehats.com/">Edie Hats</a> is fantastic (and Igor and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157602230172666/">the MoMoVan attendees looked great</a> in them). I have two of their hats and will head to their celebration this weekend at their Granville Island Store&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;<br /> <br /></p>

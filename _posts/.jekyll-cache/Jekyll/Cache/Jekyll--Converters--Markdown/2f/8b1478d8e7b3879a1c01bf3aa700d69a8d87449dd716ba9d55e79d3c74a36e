<blockquote><p>Again, if people want to take ownership of their metadata, that will be a good thing for anybody who migrates along with users to a new paradigm. That new paradigm: streaming gestures of intention to the cloud(s) rather than waiting like needles to be picked out of the search haystack. No reason why Google or Publishers should fear this unless they refuse to engage directly with their customers.</p></blockquote>

I"€<p>What is the best Bluetooth headset to buy for recording podcasts while bicycling? My guess is something with great noise reduction like the <a href="http://jawbone.com/headsets/compare">Jawbone Era</a>.&nbsp; What say you? (I am not interested in listening to music so A2DP not required, just want to record my off the cuff thoughts while bicycling using an app like Cinchast)</p>

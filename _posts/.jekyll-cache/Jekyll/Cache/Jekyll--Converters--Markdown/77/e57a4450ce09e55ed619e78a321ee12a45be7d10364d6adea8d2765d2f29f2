<p><strong>QUOTE</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: It&#39;s leadership by example and by inspiration and maybe by coordinating, rather than by ordering.</p><p>A: I agree with Benkler that there&#39;s a third form of production along with the market and the firm, that&#39;s emerging around common-space peer production, and that we don&#39;t understand a great deal about it yet. I would not dismiss it. But neither do I think we really know whether you can do it with things other than producing code or a knowledge repository online. What can&#39;t you do with it? We don&#39;t really know yet.<strong> </strong></p></blockquote>

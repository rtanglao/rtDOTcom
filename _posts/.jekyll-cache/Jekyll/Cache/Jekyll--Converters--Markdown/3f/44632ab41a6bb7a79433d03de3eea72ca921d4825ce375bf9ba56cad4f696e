  <li><a href="http://taoofmac.com/space/links/2016/10/27/1959">Rui is absolutely right, Apple is out of touch with Unix-centric pros</a> (and Iâ€™m one of them having used Unix since what 1984?). However I donâ€™t think another out of touch vendor like Lenovo or MSâ€™s surface stuff is the solution. The solution is to build our own laptops (maybe based on Lenovo hardware with more open stuff more unlocked stuff we can hack) running our own software (Ubuntu / Debian) thatâ€™s usable, power efficient, light etc.</li>

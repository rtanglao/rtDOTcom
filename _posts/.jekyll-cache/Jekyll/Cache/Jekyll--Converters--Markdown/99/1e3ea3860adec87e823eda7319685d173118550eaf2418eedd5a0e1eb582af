<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>I can't believe that Apple finally made a two-button mouse! With a middle button and scroll wheel functionality no less! Cool beans! As soon as I saw the news this morning, I decided to make a quick trip down to the Palo Alto Apple Store and snag one for a quick review - it's a good thing I went early, they only received 10 of them and I bought the second to last one. With California tax, the cost was $50.96, quite a premium over the roughly $15 I paid for the black Microsoft scroll-wheel mouse it's replacing, but hey, it's a cool Apple product, right? I knew I'd be paying a premium for this stuff, and this mouse is pretty innovative.</blockquote>

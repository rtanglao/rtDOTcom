<blockquote>Several years ago, I figured out that a significant part of a designer's job was to (somehow) come up with the correct solution for a given problem and then sell that decision to the client. For me, like Jeff, the solution would usually arrive fairly late in the game after I'd been soaking in the problem for 90% of the available time.</blockquote>

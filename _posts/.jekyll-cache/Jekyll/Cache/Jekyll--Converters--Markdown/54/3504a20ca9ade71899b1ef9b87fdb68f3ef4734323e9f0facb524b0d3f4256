  <li>It’s simple for you me, Dries and everybody :-)  ! <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2007/08/09/create-compelling-content-constantly-or-consistently/">Create Compelling Content Constantly</a> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
  <li>And really, is it necessary to make every blog a <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/06/07/more-reasons-why-i-dont-like-mailing-lists-quoted-emails-and-html-emails/">mailing list</a>? I’ll answer that question for you: NO :-) !!!!!  (Dries writes that one of the considerations is that every update goes out as an email to 5000 subscribers! #firstWorldDriesProblems :-) )</li>
  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/07/p1-No-email-newsletter-and-other-accoutrements/">Again I won’t be offering this blog as an email list or a newsletter unless I have something to sell</a> but I’m crazy that way :-) #ymmv</li>
  <li>Having said that I can’t wait to see what solution Dries implements after he finishes the yak shaving he writes about in <a href="https://dri.es/reclaiming-my-blog-as-my-thought-space">“Reclaiming my blog as my thought space”</a> but for most people you don’t need to analyze to this detail! Just do it! 2 words, 2 paragraphs, 2 pages I don’t care. Just put it out there :-) #ymmv</li>

I"j<p>I use my mobile phone (N70 thanks to the Nokia Blogger Relations program and my 7610 that I paid with my own money before that) to take <a href="http://roland.blip.tv/">short films</a> so technically I qualify as a Piratopian and I take pictures of everything including what I am shopping for so I guess that makes me a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/n70">High Street Hedonist</a>. But since I don't have access to a 3G network (even though the N70 is a 3G capable phone), I don't strictly qualify!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
Blockchain computers introduced Merkle computing. Currently the verification &amp; enforcement are in the same system (blockchains).<br /><br />

On the edges, however, cheaper and more varied Merkle computing could open a much wider, more open, audit-able, shared &amp; verifiable computing substrate.<br /><br />

Exploring more generic and varied Merkle computing with different styles of computational courts could lead to some very interesting, emergent applications.<br /><br />

Itâ€™s exciting.

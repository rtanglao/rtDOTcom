I"¾<p>Pure FUD. Perhaps Vassil doesn't realize that 1000s of companies are happily using LAMP and other <a href="http://drupal.org/">open</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://plone.org/">source</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/">solutions</a> for their blogging and business networking needs without fearing the integration bogeyman. In 1999, companies were wary of using open source, in 2005 it's a no brainer.</p>

<blockquote><p>You may ask why we want to use .NET vs. Drupal or some other free blogging software. Well, because after talking to many corporations and potential clients, they all want a platform that integrates with your current IT infrastructure. So, since most desktops are a Microsoft based, why would you do anything else if you are going after the corporate market.</p> </blockquote>

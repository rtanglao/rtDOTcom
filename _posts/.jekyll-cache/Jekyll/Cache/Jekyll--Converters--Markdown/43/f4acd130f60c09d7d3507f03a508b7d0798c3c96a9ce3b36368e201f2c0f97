<p>My not so great notes but some great food for thought and steps that we can all apply and of course note that itâ€™s not a binary world we live in more grey than black or white :-) Everybody is both introverted and extraverted at times!</p>

<h3 id="if-you-prefer-introversion-heres-how-to-deal-with-extraverts">if you prefer introversion, hereâ€™s how to deal with extraverts:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>communicate voice to voice (hard with timezones)</li>
  <li>listen very closely to the last sentence!</li>
  <li>signal that youâ€™re engaged in the conversation</li>
  <li>let the pace of conversation be quick if appropriate</li>
  <li>if you need to process SAY SO :-)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="virtual-meetings-how-to">virtual meetings HOW TO</h3>

<ul>
  <li>post as much as you can in advance</li>
  <li>pause</li>
  <li>ask specific team members for their perspectives</li>
  <li>actively solicit ideas that bubble up after meeting</li>
  <li>split more complex decisions into 2+ meetings</li>
  <li>plan for setbacks as  you improve team dynamics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-you-prefer-extraversion-heres-how-to-deal-with-introverts">if you prefer extraversion, hereâ€™s how to deal with introverts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>communicate first in writing whenever possible even if itâ€™s just on
slack 10 minutes before</li>
  <li>listen very closely to the first sentence</li>
  <li>wait during their pauses - donâ€™t fill in the quiet space with more
words [roland] - omg this is so difficult for me!</li>
  <li>ask how long people would love to think about a decision or a topic</li>
  <li>circle back after conversations to learn their thoughts (10 minutes
up to 2 days)</li>
</ul>

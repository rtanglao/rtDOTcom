<ul>
  <li>My modest-unencumbered-by-knowledge :-) vision for Thunderbird - Reuse Andrew Sutherland et alâ€™s Firefox OS mail client for desktop and mobile, IMAP only and add better searching.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t need add-ons.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t need IRC or any other messaging, just IMAP email. I think POP is something whose day has come and gone.</li>
  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/27/p1-email-will-fail-in-2018-use-todo-crm-database-wiki-blogs-etc-instead/">I donâ€™t need to locally store gigabytes of emails (thatâ€™s what Calendars, ToDo lists, CRMs, databases, blogs, wikis, etc are for :-) )</a></li>
  <li>#ymmv and thatâ€™s totally fine :-) ! As I said I am unencumbered by knowledge !!!!!</li>
  <li>Read the Thunderbird vision (<a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/tb-planning/2018-January/005744.html">January 2018 Thunderbird vision thread</a>, <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/tb-planning/2018-February/005747.html">February 2018 thread</a>) of others for more insight.</li>
  <li>Disclaimer: I used to work on Thunderbird support, but I havenâ€™t worked on Thunderbird since 2012. I know nothing about the code; I still use Thunderbird daily but I wonâ€™t be heart broken if/when Thunderbird in its present form ceases to exist; I will just use something else! And like many others I pay Thunderbird a small amount of money to hopefully keep it going and to fund Thunderbird.next whatever that turns out to be!</li>

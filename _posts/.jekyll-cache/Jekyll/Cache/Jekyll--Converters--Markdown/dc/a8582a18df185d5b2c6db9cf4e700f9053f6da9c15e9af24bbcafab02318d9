It's been 3 weeks since <a href="http://events.nokia.com/openlab">Nokia Open Lab 2008</a> (<a href="http://womhelsinki08.pbwiki.com">wiki</a>) in Helsinki and my mind is still reeling! If you don't want to watch my video (apologies for the audio quality) above, check out the show notes (which summarize maybe half of the video!):

	<li>Fantastic people, fantastic event, in particular the women I had a chance to really speak with were great: <a href="http://www.mickipedia.com/">Micki</a>, <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/">Jen</a> and <a href="http://writerscabal.com/default.aspx">Anne</a> - glad I had a chance to have in-depth conversations with you all. I suggest that the event needsÂ  to be longer next time and include more non native English speakers in a more inclusive manner </li>
	<li>The environment is everything. We need to get beyond an economy based on &quot;gadget obsolescence&quot;. It's the end ofÂ  business as usual as <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/">Umair</a> says. Thanks for leading me to further insight about the environment, Micki!</li>
	<li>Nokia gratuitous advice time :-) Team 1 milks the cash cow of S60 by refining it. Team 2 starts with a clean sheet and comes up with a mobile to make the early adopters once again fall in love with Nokia (hint: it's got to be open, it's got to be an holistic experience, perhaps it's green, perhaps it's a lifetime hardware subscription, a lifetime phone!)</li>
	<li>How about a&quot;DeviceCamp&quot; where people like the Nokia Open Lab Participants come together with Nokia Software andÂ  Hardware people (under NDA if need be!) to produce a real device over a long weekend? It could be designed in a Wiki or in a visual riffing service like <a href="http://www.conceptshare.com/">ConceptShare</a> beforehand! Let's do it in Vancouver! </li>
	<li>Nokia you know where to find me if you need further input and feedback! Love to help! </li>
	<li>To everybody at Nokia Open Lab 2008: Come to Vancouver and I'll help you get a rental bicycle and I'll show you my city! </li>

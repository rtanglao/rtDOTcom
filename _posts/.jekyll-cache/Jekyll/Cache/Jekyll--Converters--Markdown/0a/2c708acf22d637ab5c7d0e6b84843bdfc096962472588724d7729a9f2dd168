  <li>Probably Wrong way to make slides but my mantra: “In 3 slides visualize (not outline!!!!) your thesis/story”</li>
  <li>If you can’t do it in the first 3 slides then I’ll fall asleep :-)</li>
  <li>Also I love the idea of deliberately leaving things out and having slides for them in reserve for the Q&amp;A (and leaving plenty i.e. most of the time for Q&amp;A)</li>
  <li>Inspired by <a href="https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2018/03/24/making-slides/">Kieran Healy’s Making Slides</a></li>
  <li>Maybe this is why I don’t give many talks :-) ?!?!?</li>

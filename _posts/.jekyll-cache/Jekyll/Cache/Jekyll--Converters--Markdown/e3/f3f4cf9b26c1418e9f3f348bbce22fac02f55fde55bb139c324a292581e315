I"d<p>OK, after this ringing endorsement from Cory Doctorow, I have to re-evaluate <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/">Shrook</a>. I wasnâ€™t too impressed with 1.0 but 2.0 sounds cool.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/23/wicked_rss_reader_re.html">Boing Boing: Wicked RSS reader redesign</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>My RSS reader of choice, Shrook, went 2.0 this morning. After five or six hours of using it (couldn't sleep, friggin' jetlag), I am in love. This is the best UI overhaul I've ever seen (the old UI was pretty good too), a completely unexpected redesign that nevertheless managed to make this app that I use all day, every day, into something five times more useful and stable than it had been the day before. I like this punctuated equilibrium stuff.</blockquote>

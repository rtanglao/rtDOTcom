<p>From <a href="http://www.dylangreene.com/blog.asp?blogID=330">Dylan Greene dot com - Blog Reader done in Flex</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Thanks to Foo for find this simple Blog Reader created using Flex.

Flex is Macromedia's XML-based UI API, which I talk more about here.

This is the first almost-real-world Flex example I've seen. I've played with XAML a small bit, but haven't seen any real-world examples like this.

What I want to see now: A MXML (Flex) to XAML (Avalon) translator done in XSL.</blockquote>

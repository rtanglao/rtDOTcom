    <ul>
      <li>Is deep learning approaching a wall?</li>
      <li>Deep learning thus far is shallow and has limited capacity for transfer</li>
      <li>Deep learning thus far has no natural way to deal with hierarchical structure</li>
      <li>Deep learning thus far cannot inherently distinguish causation from correlation</li>
      <li>Deep learning presumes a largely stable world, in ways that may be problematic</li>
      <li>Deep learning thus far works well as an approximation, but its answers often cannot be fully trusted</li>
      <li>What would be better?</li>

<p>My <a href="/archives/2007/12/14/rolands-christmas-2007-social-geek-gadget-list">last list</a> was too materialistic and too computer centred. You shouldn&#39;t have to tell a social geek this but here&#39;s some Vancouver-centric suggestions for getting away from the screen:</p><ol><li>Get your SGeek to play in the snow. Tubing, Tobogganing, Cross Country Skiing and Snow Shoeing are inexpensive. Get a gift certificate or buy a lesson at a place like <a href="http://cypressmountain.com/index.asp">Cypress</a>.</li><li>On your bike sunshine!We are blessed with a mild but rainy climate. Get your SGeek a light (under $20) or some raingear and bike in the rain and the dark! It&#39;s fun and great exercise.<br /></li><li>Theatre tickets</li><li>Dance tickets</li><li>Music Tickets<br /></li><li>Gift certificate at fav restaurant</li><li>Knit him or her a scarf. Essential and stylish in Vancouver.</li></ol>Failing that there&#39;s always books like Benkler&#39;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561">The Wealth of Networks</a>  and classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linked-Everything-Connected-Else-Means/dp/0452284392">Barabasi&#39;s Linked</a> or anything by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> or <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Cory Doctorow</a>. And as a Northern Voice 2008 organizer,  I must point out that <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a>, Canada&#39;s oldest blogging conference and most eclectic social media conference. Northern Voice is a must attend for any social geek and a bargain and a good gift at $60, so <a href="http://2008.northernvoice.ca/registration-page-2008">register today</a> since we do sell out!

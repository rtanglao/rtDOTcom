<p>From <a href="http://infodesign.no/artikler/Videoblog_with_Blogger_211004.html">Videoblogging with Blogger</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Almost everyone who owns a computer has the ability to edit and publish video. Several hundred thousand people already have photoblogs and there are  more than 1,5 million text-bloggers. How come there are so few videobloggers around? Is it really that hard to make a videoblog? No, in fact it has become pretty easy, but in order to help you start this tutorial will show you how to become a videoblogger using Blogger.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

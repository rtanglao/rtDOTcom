*  `Old proverb: “The best time to start a blog is 20 years ago. The second-best time is today.” :) ` <--- from inessential aka Brent Simmons: [Happy 20th to This Blog](https://inessential.com/2019/11/07/happy_20th_to_this_blog_)!
* #ymmv of course but [daily writing publicly or even privately](http://localhost:4000/2018/07/24/p1-daily-blogging-and-frequent-coding/) will help in the long run!

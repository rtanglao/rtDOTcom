## Pontifications

* To follow up from yesterday's Know Roaming post, [Know Roaming Sim Sticker for Canadians - highly recommended](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/20/p1-know-roaming-highly-recommended/), you can use euro-roaming if you have a European address. So use KR for the first day, and then get a SIM mailed to your European address?!?! I guess this only works for long visits, i.e. longer than 2 weeks where you actually have a European address where you can receive mail.

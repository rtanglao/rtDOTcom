title: "De-ranting: Making non constructive feedback visible only to the person who posted it"
---

## Pontifications
* I'm a wee bit tired :-) of ranting, insults and other non-constructive feedback
* I suggest that this non-constructive text be marked by admins from all of the websites that I work on and that once marked, have it visible only to the people who posted the non-constructive text. (The constructive-feedback text if any would be unaltered and visible to all)
* Examples would be google play store reviews. Volunteers who are replying to Google Play Store reviews shouldn't have to read endless insults when replying to reviews.
* What's the best way to do this? An add-on? A web app?

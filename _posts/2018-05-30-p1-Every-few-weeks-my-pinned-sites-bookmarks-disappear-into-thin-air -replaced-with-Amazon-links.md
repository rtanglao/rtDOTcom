title: "Every few weeks my pinned sites & bookmarks disappear into thin air replaced with Amazon links -- Firefox doesn't do this nor does Chrome"

## Pontifications

* User review of Firefox for Android --> "Every few weeks my pinned sites & bookmarks disappear into thin air replaced with Amazon links" <-- 99.99999% Firefox for Android doesn't do this nor does Chrome or any other browser on Android
* So what's causing this you ask?
* Good Question :-)
* Wild guesses but it's probably one or more of the following:
    * anti-virus
    * an errant Firefox for Android add-on (unlikely but possible)
    * your WiFi or 3G or 4G provider
* All software including Chrome, Firefox, or any piece of software on any phone or tablet or computer will continue to have sad bugs like this until [we build secure reliable components at every software layer in a safe language like Rust](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/24/p1-computer-software-full-of-bugs-hard-modify-create/), Haskell or some such (not C++, not Javascript, not Python, not Ruby, not Fortran :-), not Cobol, not C, not BASIC etc etc)

Right on! Something to strive for.  Share anything (from original thoughts to remixes/riffs on things you are interested in found automagically by tomorrow's information aggregators), anywhere, anytime with whomever you choose!

From <a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/2004/05/10.html#a728">How to Save the World - PUSHING THE BLOGGING ENVELOPE: BETTER, FASTER, SIMPLER, FREE</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I would even anticipate that by 2010 we will have one easy-to-use, integrated personal content management and social networking tool that will encompass e-mail, blogging, videoconferencing, browsing, and the publishing of and subscription to multimedia content of all types, from movies and music and TV programming to the customized daily paper and your favourite greatly-enhanced blogs. It will make personal electronic information management as easy and intuitive as the management of paper documents it supercedes. And much more powerful.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

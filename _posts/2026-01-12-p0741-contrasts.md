>What’s missing is a global framework for identifying where these efforts will make the biggest difference right now. We call this the Marginal Tipping Map.

>The Marginal Tipping Map is not yet a finished tool—it is a proposed framework, a way of thinking that enables more effective action. It is designed to help funders, governments, and institutions see where catalytic investments, policy shifts, and social momentum can unlock exponential change.

>This isn’t just about data—it’s about shifting strategy: from allocating cost to identifying leverage. From asking who should act, to revealing where action will move the most.

>And it’s not hypothetical. We’ve seen it before:

>* Solar costs fell 89% in a decade due to scale and learning.
>*    Norway’s EV adoption crossed 80% with clear public signals.
>*    The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act triggered hundreds of billions in private investment.
>*    Vietnam and Germany launched solar booms with targeted policy shifts.

>These tipping points didn’t happen by accident. They were enabled. The question is how to identify and trigger the next ones—globally

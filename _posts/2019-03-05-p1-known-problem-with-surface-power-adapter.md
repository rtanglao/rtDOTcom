title: "The Windows black screen of death is due to a known problem with the Surface power adapter I believe: it can't supply 60W so it can't charge enough to charge and run the Surfacebook simultaneously when the battery is < 10% "

* My guess: The Windows black screen of death is due to a known problem with the Surface power adapter I believe: it can't supply 60W so it can't charge enough to charge and run the Surfacebook simultaneously when the battery is < 10%
    - Based on "If the battery is drained, and the charger you’re using uses 60 watts or more, your Surface will instantly turn on when you plug it in. If you’re using a charger that uses less than 60 watts, your Surface must charge to 10% before it will turn on." from [Surface battery won’t charge or Surface won’t run on battery on Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4023536/surface-surface-battery-wont-charge), it's my guess that the Surface Book 2 power adapter doesn't supply 60W (since when the battery is < 10% and you try to use the Surface Book 2 adapter, the battery doesn't go above 10% while with a 60W USB-C charge the battery *does* go to above 10%)!!!!! Wow, hope my guess is wrong!

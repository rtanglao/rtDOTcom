title: Fernando Link Scraper -- Silly Software I won't write
---


## Pontifications

My friend Fernando Medrano posts excellent [food related links](https://twitter.com/fmedeats) and excellent [political links](https://twitter.com/fernandomedran0) to Facebook (as well as twitter but mostly Facebook) which you can't search or find later because Facebook s*xors that way :-)

Wouldn't it be great if somebody wrote a scraper that posted those links to pinboard or tumblr?

Doesn't strike me as difficult! Just get Facebook updates via email and email them to tumblr?!?! Can you still get Facebook updates via email?

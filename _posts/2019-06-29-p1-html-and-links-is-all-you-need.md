# Pontifications

* The demise of EverNote (see [Ahead of Its Time, Behind the Curve: Why Evernote Failed to Realize Its Potential](https://usefyi.com/evernote-history/)) just shows that static HTML pages in the form of a [blog and/or a wiki](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/27/p1-email-will-fail-in-2018-use-todo-crm-database-wiki-blogs-etc-instead/) and links is all you need in the end; everything else is icing on the cake.
* Don't depend on somebody else's clouds or servers or even your own computer to store all your personal notes, it's fine to use fancy tools like EverNote but place your real bets on a collection of  static html pages that you can use and move anywhere.

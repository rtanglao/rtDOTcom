title: Color's idea for co-locative co-temporal automatic social network is great
  but Color's execution merits a D

After 6 days with <a href="http://color.com/">Color</a> here are  some musings:
<ul>
<li>To me, the idea of a co-locative co-temporal automatically created without passwords and users social network aka "co-created photo and video commons" is great; not sure if that's mainstream, perhaps it will be</li>
<li>The App is flawed: no obvious way to browse by users, no help information, no tutorial (there is one on the website, but since this app-centric, there should be a tutorial accessible from the app!)</li>
<li>The App is flawed: no way to unfollow a user or at least delete a user's photos.</li>
<li>The App is flawed: no way to "unPost". Would be great to be able to delete your photo or video within 10 minutes of posting it.
<li>There is no web presence. Why have a website if it doesn't have proper permanent links for each user? (is this unfriendly link my permanent link:<a href="http://color.com/s/6a0esD">http://color.com/s/6a0esD</a>?)</li>
<li>10 second videos are cool, but 1 minute or ideally 1:30 like flickr would be great</li>
<li>Color is yet another social media ghetto where you can't get your stuff out with full metadata. Please follow flickr's example and provide an API that allows full metadata to be extracted along with the photos and video.
</ul>

No obvious utility even to digital hipsters as evidenced by its lack of takeup; not everybody is an environment of iPhone and Android users who will try and both use this app. Color needs to promote themselves at conferences or events where lots of folks use the app (e.g. a geek conference with lots of iPhone & Android users; perhaps <a href="http://2011.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a> but probably not because it isn't iPhone and Android-centric) and thereby bootstrap their network. I think with the improvements above and heavy promotion at events with heavy Android and iPhone usage, it could be big, but there's no evidence that this will happen so far. 

<b>Conclusion: Great idea, D for execution. Color will not succeed but somebody else who's hungrier will take this idea and do it right eventually. A "co-locative co-temporal automatic social network" aka "co-created photo and video commons" will happen with or without Color.</b>

title: "Happy Holidays, Happy New Year and Merry Christmas; my 2020-2021 holidays post"

* I realized I didn't write a Thanksgiving post back in October. This will probably be my last post of 2020.
* Looking back, I am very thankful to family, friends, supporters, funders and those who have helped out when I was in need.
* So lucky to have family, health, a roof over our heads and food.
* Let's continue to wear our masks, maintain 2 metre distance, stick to our bubbles and flatten the curve and get rid of COVID together in 2021.

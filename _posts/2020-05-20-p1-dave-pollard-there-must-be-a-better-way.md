* **QUOTE** --> We have forgotten that the need of the person drilling into wood to make a piece of art or craft is *not* for a drill — faster, quieter, more efficient, or more ergonomic. It is for a *hole*. If we want to escape imaginative poverty, we are going to have to relearn and re-practice imagining *how else we might meet the need for a hole*, rather than how we might add “features” to the drill, or connect it to  the internet to do something flashy that could not be done otherwise,  just to produce *the same damn hole*. In many industries, what is called “innovation” has forsaken responding to what is *needed* in favour of what is *possible* (which requires much less imagination). **END QUOTE** <--- Read the whole thing: [Dave Pollard: There must be a better way](https://howtosavetheworld.ca/2020/05/19/there-must-be-a-better-way/)

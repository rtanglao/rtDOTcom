title: Prynt Zink 2x3 inches - Is printable area 620x1120 or something smaller?
---

Since the [Prynt Kickstarter days](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/prynt/prynt-the-first-instant-camera-case-for-iphone-and/description), I've been a proud owner of the fun [prynt](https://www.prynt.co/) Zink 2" x 3" printer case (I use it on a Samsung S5).

## Support Query
Here's a support query I filed with print about the printable area on prynt:

From [http://support.prynt.co/knowledge-base/what-paper-does-the-prynt-case-use/](http://support.prynt.co/knowledge-base/what-paper-does-the-prynt-case-use/)

>"The Prynt Case uses ZINK® (Zero Ink®) Printing 
>Technology that produces photo-quality, full-color
>photos (313×339 DPI or 620×1120 px)"

ENDQUOTE 

Does the above mean that I can print on the full 620x1120px area or is the actual area that is printed smaller? If smaller what are the dimensions in pixels? 

Cheers!<br />

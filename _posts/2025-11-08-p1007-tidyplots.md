Perhaps use it for art and SUMO data?!?! ; Jan Broder Engler:: Get started • tidyplots](https://jbengler.github.io/tidyplots/articles/tidyplots.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `This getting started guide aims to empower individuals without a programming background to engage in code-based plotting with tidyplots. We will start by covering essential software tools and discussing data preparation. Next, we will introduce the tidyplots workflow, which includes adding, removing, and adjusting plot components. Finally, we will showcase the application of themes and multiplot layouts.`

* Previously: 
  * [Everything  built on insecure non verified software layers will break at some point  because you will be forced to refactor or modify those insecure non  verified layers in a non backwards compatible way](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/11/17/p1-everything-built-on-insecure-non-verified-layers-will-break-at-some-point-you-will-refactor-modify-those-layers-in-a-non-backwards-compatible-way/)

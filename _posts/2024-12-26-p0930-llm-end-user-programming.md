If this hypothesis indeed comes true, we might start to see some surprising changes in the way people use software:

One-off scripts: Normal computer users have their AI create and execute scripts dozens of times a day, to perform tasks like data analysis, video editing, or automating tedious tasks.
* One-off GUIs: People use AI to create entire GUI applications just for performing a single specific task—containing just the features they need, no bloat.
* Build don’t buy: Businesses develop more software in-house that meets their custom needs, rather than buying SaaS off the shelf, since it’s now cheaper to get software tailored to the use case.
* Modding/extensions: Consumers and businesses demand the ability to extend and mod their existing software, since it’s now easier to specify a new feature or a tweak to match a user’s workflow.
* Recombination: Take the best parts of the different applications you like best, and create a new hybrid that composes them together.

All of these changes would go beyond just making our current software production process faster. They would be changing when software gets created, by whom, for what purpose.

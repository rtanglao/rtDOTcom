[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 21, 2024 06:46 [Open-source is a chainsaw](https://ergaster.org/posts/2024/03/20-open-source-chainsaw/) <-- Nothing is free. Open source can mean you get random responsibility for features that you accept from others which over time can become unsustainable for one person especially if that person isn't being paid for the open source software. --> **QUOTE**: `In practice, Bob didn’t just offer free work! ... He also offloaded his maintenance responsibility to Alice. It is now up to her to check that she doesn’t break the feature when she releases new versions of her software.`

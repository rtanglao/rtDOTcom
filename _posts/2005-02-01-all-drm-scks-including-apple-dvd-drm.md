<p>Another reason not to buy DVDs. If you buy something, you should be able to play it regardless of where you are; this nugget of common sense seems to have escaped the money and power hungry DVD industry. DRM s*cks!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/01/apple_restricting_dv.html">Boing Boing: Apple restricting DVD region-changes -- voluntarily! -- UPDATED</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>In the crazy world of DRM for DVDs, there's this idea that a Hollywood studio should be able to tell you where you're allowed to watch a DVD after you buy it. They accomplish this with something called "Region Codes." Discs have region-codes and players have region-codes. If you have a Region 1 disc (US and Canada) and a Region 2 player (Europe), and you put the disc in the player, the player will reject it.
</p>
<p>But what happens when you take your laptop from New York to London? You're in Region 2, but you bought your device in Region 1. Can you buy a disc in London and play it on your computer?
</p>
<p>Yes and no. When a computer manufacturer gets a DVD-decoding license from Hollywood's licensing cartel (the DVD Copy Control Association or CCA), it is allowed to make players that can change regions up to five times.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

## Pontifications
* Based on the [ruby script in Scraping web pages with ruby, mechanize and nokogiri -- How To Log in, get URL of a link and get link title](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/09/p1-scraping-web-pages-submitting-forms-with-mechanize-nokogiri/), I would like to write an enhanced script that:
    * 1. logins to Lithium
    * 2. switches to Community admin
    * 3. pastes in [https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-showfor.json/blob/master/showfor.json](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-showfor.json/blob/master/showfor.json) and submit the form

title: anchor.fm is much better now! But will it last another year?
---

## Pontifications
* Glad to see [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm/) survived a year! (I tried anchor when it first launched on iOS a year ago! Didn't think they'd survive honestly but glad they did!)
* Love the improvements. Much easier and much funnier and much easier to share? Try it!
* And non-obviously (user experience needs fixing for this!) there are permanent links: Tap on ```Share``` and then ```Share just this segment``` to share a permanent link to Twitter (only works in the mobile app, doesn't work on the desktop version!)
* Sample permanent link: [Roland Springsteen :-) goes to Vegas](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/875240294345723904) 
* For a not-so-good time LOL, listen to my station [anchor.fm/roland](https://anchor.fm/roland) :-)

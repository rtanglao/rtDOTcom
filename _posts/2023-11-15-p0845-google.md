[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 15, 2023 08:45 [We are drowning in Google's magnanimity - kpassa.me](https://www.kpassa.me/posts/google/#fnref:2) <--- OKRs considered harmful! i totally agree --> **QUOTE**: `The appeal of OKRs is in their perceived simplicity: any problem large, or small, organizational or technical, made solvable by careful setting of O’s and KR’s.2 ...It never plays out as promised: a few cycles deep into OKRs will leave startups wondering why they’re so dumb they can’t implement what seems like a pretty simple system. ...I think the reason is that OKRs add one or two more terms exactly where we need them least. We already have a bunch of good terms to talk about problem solving in this domain, after all: a roadmap expresses the “what”; agile is the “how”.`

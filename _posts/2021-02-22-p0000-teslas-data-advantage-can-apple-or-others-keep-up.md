[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 22, 2021.[Tesla’s data advantage. Can Apple, or others, keep up?](https://scobleizer.blog/2021/02/21/teslas-data-advantage-can-apple-or-others-keep-up/)"I hear that by the end of the year Tesla will turn on such features. Now, what will that look like on the road? All Teslas will start switching lanes to lane #3. You won’t even know why, even if you are in one, until you pass by the bucket in lane #1. "  and "Tesla’s robotaxis will fix both problems. Tesla’s economics are that it could rent you a Model 3 for about $10 an hour. Even a top of the line Roadster could rent for $30 an hour. A $200,000 car cheaper than an Uber? Yes! And at these prices Tesla will be HUGELY profitable compared to Uber. The wholesale cost of a Model 3 actually is only $3 an hour" <---respect the opinion but think it's wrong, 1) robotaxis won't work at scale neither will 2) automatic object (like the bucket on the road in the blog post) and evasion work at scale either. Again we have the technology to make mobility accessible to all, we just refuse to ban cars and use buses, and trains instead. All bets are off if we get a true intelligence breakthrough. AI as presently constructed using Turing machines and pattern recognition won't make 1) or2) workable

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 14, 2023 15:42 [David Fincher's new movie 'The Killer' is sigma cinema](https://maxread.substack.com/p/david-finchers-new-movie-the-killer) <-- S*gma m*le, Al*ha m*le, etc etc all sound like terrible things to aspire to be! --> QUOTE: `The killer thinks of himself as having an unmatched clarity about his life and the world, but the movie mostly regards him as self-deluded. He botches his hits, he forms attachments, he misunderstands his own importance. Rather than being freed by his careful planning and elaborately articulated life philosophy, heâ€™s trapped by his own paranoias and resentments.`

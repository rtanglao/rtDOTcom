## Pontifications

* Like [WiFi](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/12/p1-had-to-reboot-to-get-wifi-working-on-surface-book2/), the USB gets into a funky state every so often on the Microsoft Surface Book 2 and the only way to fix it is to reboot. This works fine on Mac just like WiFi works fine on Mac. Sad but true! Shouldn't happen if the computer is made and designed by the same company that made the operating system, right :-) ?!?!
* Otherwise stil very happy with this computer.
* WSL works great, screen is great, etc etc

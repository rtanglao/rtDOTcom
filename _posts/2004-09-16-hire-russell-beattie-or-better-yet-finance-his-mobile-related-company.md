</p><blockquote>
I'm now a "Free Agent" (or soon will be) which is code for Unemployed. Call Odd Todd. Lots of options for sure, and we'll see how much opportunity shows up as a result of this post. I would've rather have had one job in hand before moving on to the next, but this is how things went, so now I'll scramble a little bit and hopefully things will work out. It'd be just my life to be chatting up various successful techie gazillionaires one weekend and be homeless the next, wouldn't it?

<br />I'm actually quite jazzed about the change. I've got about six weeks before things start to get tight, so I'm going to do my best to shop around my latest and great mobile idea and see if I can get funding of some sort to get it moving. It's a project based on Mobile Content, which I'm very excited about. I'm going to try to crank out a demo, write up a business plan, and use as many connections as I can to get it in front of the right eyes. As much as I liked working for my old company, I've been dying to start my own gig for years. I think my understanding of the industry and the technology is as good as anyone's (or better) and I think being able to set direction would improve my chances of success enormously.

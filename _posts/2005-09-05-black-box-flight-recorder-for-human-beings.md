<p>Definitely want one of these :-) ! Talk about automatic presence detection and recording! But if MS Research won't give me one, I am sure it will be available through my mobile phone within 5 years!

<p>From <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/go/2694/">gizmag Article: SenseCam - the Black Box Flight Recorder for human beings</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>The SenseCam is a badge-sized wearable visual diary that captures up to 2000 VGA images per day into FLASH memory, offering a continually building repository of information on what you have done during the day in visual form. In addition, sensor data such as movement, light level and temperature is continuously monitored and any sudden changes in any of the above triggers the camera.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

If it passes, then you continue. It if fails, then you assume its a bad request. (code attached as a note but superbriefly: class ClassTypeYouAreChecking(BaseModel) field1 = int field2 = UUID etc)...Its much more clear about what data you are expecting, what is optional, and also pydantic library will check the types of these parameters automatically!`

* `"There are a lot of languages and tools that can be used for data science. Why should you choose F#? A two-word answer to the question is type providers. However, there are other reasons."` <- From Tomas Petricek: [Analyzing and visualizing data with F#](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-f-sharp)
* F#'s **type providers** sound great!
* I'm intrigued by [F#](https://fsharp.org/) and the fact that there is a verified implementation of TLS in F# and [F7](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/f7-refinement-types-for-f/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fprojects%2Ff7%2F), [miTLS](https://www.mitls.org/)

title: Nokia Media Transfer works on my N93 even though the setup app crashed

<p>
The Nokia Media Transfer setup app crashed when I was setting up my N93 but it seems to have set things up properly. Hooray seamless syncing from iTunes to my N93. Long overdue. Go Nokia go! Things to fix: the kludgy invocation of iTunes and iPhoto (asking people not to move the mouse or use the keyboard while Nokia Media Transfer setup is running is lame and error prone). This could be Apple's fault but it should be fixed in future releases!

ActivityPub is a federated social network protocol published by the W3C. The ActivityPub network consists of millions of users, and is implemented across a large number and variety of applications. The core concepts and extension mechanism of ActivityPub are summarized in the ecosystem overview. Advantages of ActivityPub include a conceptual foundation that follows the actor model (with pubsub layered on top), and a flexible spec which supports extensions. However, ActivityPub as currently deployed falls short on some desirable qualities, such as decentralized storage and identity. Research into evolving ActivityPub has been in progress under the Spritely project and the OcapPub writeup. This document explains how the objects/actor model of ActivityPub could be further decentralized, and with the addition of object capabilities (OCap), could enable better moderation, payment, and collaboration mechanisms. The object capability design direction provides a foundation from which unanticipated use cases can be met, whether that future involves economic uses, business communication integration, or distributed virtual worlds.`

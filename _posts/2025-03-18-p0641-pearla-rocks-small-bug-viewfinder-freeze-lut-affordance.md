First of all, I have to say that I love pearla and will give it a 5 star review. LUTs for me are much more fun than filters. For examples of my fun LUT photos taken with Pearla: [2025-03-17 Revolver Dwd_Arklight14_33b (a stronger "Matrix the Movie" LUT)](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjC5Uf8) ( [Nick Driftwood's blog post about this Matrix LUT](https://www.nickdriftwood.com/luts/arklight-14-b-lut-pack-the-matrix-look-with-great-skintones), [Dwd_Arklight14_33b LUT](https://www.nickdriftwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Driftwood_Arklight14_and_14B_All_Size_LUTs.zip)), thanks Nick!). [2025-03-13 Pearla Kodak TMAX 3200++ Kcc](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/albums/72177720324413928/) (this LUT was discovered via this February 24, 2024 dpreview forum post: [LUTs for photography](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/67610718), [LUT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvvO38lXh0jwB_QZhoeAitYr1BCOqqnO/view?usp=drive_link)). Finally,  I don't do video just stills and it works great. So I am not going to comment on video stuff :-)

## Pearla bugs
* Viewfinder freeze still happens when loading certain LUTs and most LUTs over 1MB e.g.  [PictureFX-Leica-Barnack-125.cube from marcrphoto](https://marcrphoto.wordpress.com/2022/11/18/new-lut-update-picturefx-leica-barnack-based-on-leica-type-ii-iii-35mm-film-camera/)
* GPS tagging doesn't work on my iPhone 16 Pro Max with the latest version of iOS

## Pearla feature request

* a UX affordance e.g. button  to quickly switch between LUTs. Having to go to the settings works but is slow.
* Would be nice: a way to rename LUTs

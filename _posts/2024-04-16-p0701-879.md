If youâ€™re lucky, event websites have permalinks that remain year over year, and maybe a youtube playlist or two. ... And, we have yet to develop a protocol that better supports digital communities, hybrid events, unconferences, and other emerging forms. ... We propose a Community Search Engine Protocol for events & digital communities.` <-- Walkah and the Boris :-)

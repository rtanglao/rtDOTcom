title: "ChatOps - chat as the collaborative operating system for a team"

## Pontifications
 
* Don't believe the hype :-) of [Stride's What is ChatOps? A guide to its evolution, adoption, and significance](https://blog.stride.com/what-is-chatops-a-guide-to-its-evolution-adoption-and-significance-3d647e874781), juicy hype-filled :-)quote

**QUOTE**
<blockquote>
At the extreme end of ChatOps, we see teams that have automated large portions of mission critical work. Advanced custom bots, deep integrations, attempts at AI, and custom engineering have basically turned chat into the operating system for their team.

They are expanding the definition of ChatOps and breaking new ground when it comes to real-time collaboration. They see no limits in how they could combine work, people, and tools to transform the way people on Earth (or eventually, Mars) collaborate.

* I've talked about this before but this is the logical conclusion (and it could have been done with email instead of chat)
	* Bots/assistants with human help and without human help take chats and
	* put the appropriate stuff from chat into CRM
	* put the appropriate stuff into the appropriate wiki page or blog or google doc
	* put the appropriate stuff into a spreadsheet
	* put the appropriate stuff into a calendar
	* put the appropriate stuff into the appropriate container
	* etc etc

title: "Old surge.sh DNS settings caused this blog not to update"

* Fixed now! I was using super old settings!
* Using my DNS provider, namecheap.com set to the current recommended [surge.sh settings](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain):
```
CNAME from @ to na-west1.surge.sh
CNAME from www to na-west1.surge.sh
```

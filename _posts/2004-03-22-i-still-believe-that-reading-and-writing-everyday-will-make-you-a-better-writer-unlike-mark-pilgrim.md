I'd rather have a world where people who aren't great writers blog and write every day even if they don't improve.  Better to live in a world where people express themselves than not!

And I think over the long haul (measured in years) that 99% of the people will become better writers.  I certainly have improved!

From <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/20/assets">Most valuable asset [dive into mark]</a><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I grew up being taught, believing, and teaching others to believe that there were only two things you needed to do to become a good writer:

1.  Read every day

2.  Write every day

But now we have thousands of webloggers who read other webloggers every day, and who themselves write every day, and they&#8217;re not getting any better at writing. Some people become better writers through weblogging, but if you look around you&#8217;ll have to agree that many don&#8217;t. They may fancy themselves as writers, or even journalists, because after all they&#8217;ve been writing every day for years. But their latest stuff is just as immature and nonsensical as their old stuff. They can&#8217;t put words together. (What&#8217;s so good about putting words together? It&#8217;s traditionally considered advantageous for a writer.)

This bothers me enormously. First, the mind-boggling lack of self-knowledge required to write every day and not realize that you write badly. But more important, the fact that there is obviously a secret third ingredient required for becoming a good writer. You need to read every day... and write every day... and X. But I don&#8217;t know what X is, and obviously my teachers didn&#8217;t know either. They had it, but they didn&#8217;t know it. Daily writing is not our most valuable asset. So what is it?</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

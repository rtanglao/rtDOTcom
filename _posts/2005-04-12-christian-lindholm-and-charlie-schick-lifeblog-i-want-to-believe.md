<p>Now that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/tools/lifeblog/">Lifeblog supports Flickr</a>, I really want to believe, but I can't run it until I get the firmware on my 7610 upgraded.  <a href="http://www.christianlindholm.com/christianlindholm/work.html">Christian Lindholm</a> and <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2005/04/christianlindho.html">Charlie Schick</a>: could one of you help me upgrade my firmware (<a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/03/17/how_do_i_upgrade_my_7610_firmware_so_i_can_run_lifeblog_15_and_post_to_flickr">the 7610 is not for sale officially in Canada</a> so I can't get it through the normal channels)? I am an enthusiastic user of the 7610 (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/7610">I have taken over 2500 photos with my 7610 on flickr</a>!) and will therefore be a good tester for Lifeblog.</p>

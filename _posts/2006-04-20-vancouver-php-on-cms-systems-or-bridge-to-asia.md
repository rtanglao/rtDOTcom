title: Vancouver PHP on CMS Systems or Bridge to Asia?
created: 1145554478

Which event should I go to tonight, <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/69780/">Vancouver PHP on CMS Systems</a> (EZ Publish and Drupal) or <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/68391/">Bridge Vancouver - Networking Young Professionals Doing Business in Asia-Pacific</a> at <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/reviews/restaurants/hapa.izakaya">Hapa Izakaya</a>? Unfortunately, they seem to overlap (both occur between 6 and 8p.m.). I am leaning towards Vancouver PHP because at 41, do I qualify as young :-) ?

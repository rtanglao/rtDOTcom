<p>I don't have enough memory apparently. I wish there was a page I could link to on the Yahoo site but ... oh well there doesn't appear to be one (just crazy form driven pages where the URL doesn't change). I think I'll hold off using this until it actually is small enough to fit on my phone. I am unwilling to erase any of my current apps to work with the Yahoo behemoth :-) ! In the meantime, I will continue to use small mobile apps that are focused and work well (like Shozu!).</p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 22, 2022 20:02 [How much I’ve spent so far running my own Mastodon server on AWS](https://www.micahwalter.com/how-much-ive-spent-so-far-running-my-own-mastodon-server-on-aws/) <-- QUOTE: `In an ideal world, running all of this as is would be nice if it cost me less than $25 a month overall. That’s not much more than Twitter Blue!` <-- sounds too expensive with too many moving parts for 1 user!!!!! $10 or even $15/month is affordable. $25/month is too much.What do you think :-) ?!

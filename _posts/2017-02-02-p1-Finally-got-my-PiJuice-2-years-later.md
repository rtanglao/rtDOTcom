title: Finally got my PiJuice 2 years later! What should I do with it?
---


## Pontifications

* Technically I guess it's only 1.5 years late ([PiJuice was originally scheduled to deliver June 2015 according to their KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pijuice/pijuice-a-portable-project-platform-for-every-rasp/posts/1787673)) :-) ! The solar powered PiJuice was supposed to form the basis of a camera project maybe I can still do that?!?!?

* **QUOTE**--> Sometimes building community is about exercising vulnerability and  allowing yourself to be cared for. Sometimes it’s about power and  wielding it in a way that it shelters your kin. As you reflect on your  own life, ask yourself where your strongest sense of connection is  rooted. Find the analogue in your life that parallels what the  hḷ́x̌ʔínúx̌v, what the orca, is to me. Wear that sense of connection  boldly, like a gleaming white saddle patch. Find your pod. And in the  sense of purpose and resilience that community responsibility generates, know that you have power. <-- **END QUOTE** Read the whole thing: [Cúagilákv Jess Housty: Find Your Pod in in The Tyee](https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2020/05/25/Find-Your-Pod/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=052520-1&utm_campaign=editorial-0520)

* I will at some point do this :-) and Simon Willison's tutorial, [How to play with the GPT-3 language model](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/5/play-with-gpt3/) will be the steps I follow.

* [Tweet](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1533505888828329984): is it silly to feed the GPT-3 API 1000 randomly chosen Firefox Support Questions from [https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kits-api3/blob/main/YEARLY_CSV_FILES/2021-firefox-sumo-questions.db](https://t.co/MHHdeLUM0E) to see its "answers"?

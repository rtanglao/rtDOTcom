## Pontifications

* Like [Voice Record Pro](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/01/p1-voice-record-pro-records-stereo-through-ios-lightning-port/), [RØDE Rec](http://www.rode.com/software/roderec) also appears to record in stereo from the lightning port on iOS i.e. iPhone and iPad
* I will try both but first I will try Voice Record Pro with 2 people and 2 microphones!

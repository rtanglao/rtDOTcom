title: "Cultural Analytics page 197 Visualization without reduction aka Direct visualization"

* Please refer to my previous post: [R and ggplot2: What if, as recommended by Cultural Analytics, I used the actual text to make the graphic instead of converting the text to numbers i.e. colours  ](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/11/05/p1-use-the-actual-text-in-an-infographic-instead-of-converting-it-to-numbers/)
* From [Cultural Analytics](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/10/26/p1-cultural-analytics-lev-manovich-reading-notes/) ([book website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-analytics)) page 197-198:
  * "Although these techniques and projects are commonly discussed as information visualization, is it possible that they represent something else ... a new broad visualization method for which we do not yet have an adequate name."
  * "Images remain images; text remains text. ...we can also call this method *direct visualization* or *visualization without reduction*."
* Direct Visualization is what I created in: [R  and ggplot2: As per Cultural Analytics: Firefox Support Questions for  an hour with x set to the minute the question was asked, logo plus 5  tokens from the question](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/11/07/p1-firefox-support-questions-r-ggplot-operating-system-logo-plus-5-tokens/)

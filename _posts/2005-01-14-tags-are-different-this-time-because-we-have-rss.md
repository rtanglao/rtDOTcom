<p>IIRC correctly, Usenet did not have a machine readable syndication and aggregation format like RSS. That is the difference between the Usenet days and today I think!
</p><p>RSS and tags are a winning combination for most things I believe!</p><p>From <a href="http://www.plaidworks.com/chuqui/blog/001844.html">Teal Sunglasses: Tagging the web...</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>there are some interesting discussions going on about tagging (keywords, folksonomies, etc) the net. A good starting point is with Scott rosenberg.
</p>
<p>just to prove that history insists on repeating itself, 20 years ago, Brad Templeton suggested using keywords to classify USENET postings instead of newsgroups. I did some research on the idea that indicated to me that it wouldn't work (because people chose bad/stupid/inane/none keywords, and that you were better off auto-generating keywords than using user-created ones.
</p>
<p>So of course, Brad and I fought about it. Knews never happened, and life moved on. And now, with blogs, it's back again.</p>

<p>for those curious about the past, and maybe able to learn from it and avoid remaking our mistakes: some useful links into google groups.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

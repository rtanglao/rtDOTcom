* Just blog: I don't care whether you call it TILs (like Simon Willison's TILs see [One year of TILs](https://simonwillison.net/2021/May/2/one-year-of-tils/)) or whether it's 188 characters or 5 pages. A clich√© but true:Perfection is the enemy of the good. A regular habit of public writing that isn't on e\*il dentralized platform like twitter or facebook is a good mental muscle!

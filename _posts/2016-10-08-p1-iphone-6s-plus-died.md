title: My iPhone 6S plus died

## Pontifications

* Like [my S7 Edge dying](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/07/p1-s7-edge-died/), again not sure what happened.
* Maybe I forgot to close all the ports in my supposedly waterproof case. Maybe I didn't mount the case properly - this is more likely!
* Luckily I have an iPhone 6 plus. I "downgraded" to that and all is well.
* Again very subtle differences that you miss. The camera is worse in low light, the touch sensor is slower and the phone in general is slower.

* [Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) sounds great <--- love how each chapter is a ["complete incrementally built on the last chapter" interpreter](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/): "This was the real technical challenge of writing the book â€“ how do I take two implementations of the same language, and break them into incremental pieces that I can build up a chapter at a time?"

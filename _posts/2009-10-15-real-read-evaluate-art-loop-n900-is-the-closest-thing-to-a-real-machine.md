<p>What I am looking for in my ongoing mobile art experiments is REAL!</p><ol><li><strong>R</strong>ead the sensors (GPS, accelerometer, compass, etc)</li><li><strong>E</strong>valuate the data from the sensors</li><li><strong>A</strong>rt - Make some art (sound, graphic, image, etc) and display and store it on the mobile</li><li><strong>L</strong>oop - Back to step 1</li></ol><p>And I want to do it in a dynamic environment that doesn't force me to do yak shaving like spawning separate threads for each of the sensors or other such needless complexity that's not needed by my artistic algorithms. Nor the slings and arrows of outrageous certificates or certifications or developer programs or DRM malarkey :-) !</p><p>After reading the N900 technical reviews from the Maemo summit, it appears that the unlocked version of the N900 is the closest current device that could do this:</p><ol><li>It's Linux so assuming the sensor APIs are available from a standard Linux C (i.e. not using some non standard craziness like Carbide C++ for Symbian) library, Python, Ruby, name your favourite dynamic language here, etc (C++ and Java are just not malleable and easily hackable enough, sorry!) bindings could be (and probably are or are in the process of being) built to those C libraries</li><li>No need for developer fees or ridiculous certificates</li><li>It has all the sensors I want for my current experiments</li><li>It's NOT mass market, but it's mass market enough for hackers (unlike Bug Labs Bug which I love but already probably has less than 1/10 the amount of developers working on it as the N900).</li></ol><p>Am I right? Time for me to watch the blogs for signs of the N900 and Maemo 5 and 6 making dynamic languages first class citizens unlike on Symbian where S60 Python was far too many steps behind Carbide C++&nbsp; (and time for to save up for the N910 since the N900 will probably be crippled in some significant way as all 1st gen Nokia devices are e.g. N95-1 not having enough memory)</p>

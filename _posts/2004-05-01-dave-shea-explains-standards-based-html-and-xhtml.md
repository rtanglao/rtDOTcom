Excellent, looking forward to the sequel about CSS!

From <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2004/04/30/a_roadmap_to/#000571">mezzoblue &nbsp;&sect;&nbsp; A Roadmap to Standards</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>This afternoon I was asked by a friend what I would recommend to an old designer who wants to learn more about web standards, CSS, XML, and XHTML.

This is a perfect example of when an email response is better posted here for a wider audience (and Google). So here&#8217;s my answer: this is a comprehensive, informal, and somewhat long-winded roadmap for anyone who has heard about web standards, thinks they might want web standards, but doesn&#8217;t know where to start.

Stop! Before you do anything, the most important thing you can do for your learning process is accept that a) it&#8217;s going to take time, and b) you will be frustrated along the way.

But you&#8217;re not alone. Plenty of us who have taken the plunge into standards went through the same, and there is a growing body of work devoted to helping make your life easier. The old-timers had to figure out the hard way all the tricks and techniques we now take for granted; lucky folks who came in later (myself included) can benefit from their sweat and tears.

In the end, when your skill using standard-based design eclipses your skill using old-school table-based methods, you&#8217;ll look back and marvel at how much more sense it makes to layout a page with CSS. </blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

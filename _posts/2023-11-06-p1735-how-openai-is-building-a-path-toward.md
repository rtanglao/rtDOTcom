[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 6, 2023 17:35  [How OpenAI is building a path toward AI agents](https://www.platformer.news/p/how-openai-is-building-a-path-toward) --> These worst case scenarios will happen if "unregulated innovation" continues. --> **WORST CASE SCENARIOS QUOTE**: `Once you start enabling agents like the ones OpenAI pointed toward today, you start building the path toward sophisticated algorithms manipulating the stock market; highly personalized and effective phishing attacks; discrimination and privacy violations based on automations connected to facial recognition; and all the unintended (and currently unimaginable) consequences of infinite AIs colliding on the internet....That same Copy Editor I described above might be able in the future to automate the creation of a series of blogs, publish original columns on them every day, and promote them on social networks via an established daily budget, all working toward the overall goal of undermining support for Ukraine.`

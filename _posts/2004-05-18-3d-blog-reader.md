Sounds cool .  Must check this out.

From <a href="http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=152&#38;thread=49219">.NET Buzz Forum - The World's first 3D BlogReader by Holger Ferstl</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I was always wondering how to get deeper sight into Scoble's  postings, to zoom into his words. .. Perhaps to see his postings in other way? ... Holger  Ferstl wrote the first 3D  Blog Reader (it's in german) using .NET and Direct X. Pan, Zoom and change your  point of view while reading Blogs. Gotcha Scoble! :-)</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

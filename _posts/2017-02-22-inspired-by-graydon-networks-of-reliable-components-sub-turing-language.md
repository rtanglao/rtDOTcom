title: Inspired by Graydon's sub-Turing ideas for a language that can produce networks of reliable components
---


## Pontifications

Not sure I understand all of [what Graydon wrote about sub-Turing languages](http://graydon.livejournal.com/239070.html) but it seems like:

```
"timed automata and visibly-pushdown automata" + 
"a kind of extension of interface definition languages\
 to cover (branching) sequences of permitted calls and returns." + 
"formulae in temporal logics that range over possible\
computation paths within a formal system." 
= reliable programming for many problem domains
```

If it produces:

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>
"a language that targets compilation into reliable components, and networks-of-components, that are guaranteed to behave well; that push general-purpose languages to the periphery of those networks, as byzantine actors."
</blockquote>

**END QUOTE**

then count me in ! [Because maybe then software development wouldn't be so stupid for many problem domains :-) !](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/02/16/p1-dumbed-down-excel-or-1950s-r/)

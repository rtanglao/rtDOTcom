title: " The BloggerCon Tempest in a teapot - Both Vendor and Developer talk not allowed"

<p>
My take on the vendor pseudo controversy.   <a href="http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/">Bob</a> was speaking in "developer" talk and Dave in the heat of the moment shut him down by saying it was "vendor" talk when he meant developer talk.  And at this and all future BloggerCons both developer and vendor talk are not allowed for good reasons.

Still, it would be nice to have an extra "developer partying with user"s day and I would have loved to have gone to the <a href="http://www.bitsplitter.net/projects/backchannelcon/">after BC martini/vendor back backchannel con</a> but instead I went back to Sunnyvale to spend some time with Barb and Simon (it's always awesome to see our smiling son at the end of the day).

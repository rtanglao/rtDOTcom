title: "UC Berkeley deploys Jupyter notebooks campus wide! Bravo! Better and cheaper in terms of server costs with Iodide right?"

## Pontifications

* UC Berkeley deploys Jupyter notebooks campus wide, see [Sea change: What happens when Jupyter becomes pervasive at a university?](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/sea-change-what-happens-when-jupyter-becomes-pervasive-at-a-university) ! Bravo
* Better and cheaper in terms of server costs with [Iodide](https://iodide.io/) right? Because Iodide doesn't require a server?!?! The Iodide notebooks run in your browser!

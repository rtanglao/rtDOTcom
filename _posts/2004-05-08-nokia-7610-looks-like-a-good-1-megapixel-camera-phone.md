This looks good, I wonder when it will be available in Canada!

From <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/gallery.jsp?Id=723">Nokia 7610 Gallery (MobileBurn)</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I've had a week to play around with a Nokia 7610, thanks to the folks at the Texas office.

While I am certainly not going to review the device, since it is a pre-production model, I can tell you a bit about the new camera and toss in a screen shot. Nothing too earth-shattering, but you'll get the idea.

And of course I have a ton of photos of the phone itself, too.

For those of you that have been living under a rock, the 7610 is Nokia's latest Series 60 Symbian OS handset. The 7610 is Nokia's first megapixel camera equipped handset, too. It is quite a bit smaller than the current top of the line S60 handset, the 6600, and comes equipped with a pop-port connector on the bottom - just like the new 6620 does.

The keypad is sure to be a point of contention for some folks, with its far from traditional layout. I think most people will fairly quickly get used to it, though. It is not so drastic a change as we saw with the 3650, and while it is a bit confusing visually at first, I managed to get the hang of it. And we all know that I'm none too clever or tolerant when it comes to keypads.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

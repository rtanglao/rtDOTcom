## Pontifications

* Beyond [mere opening Firefox tabs from WSL](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/09/22/p1-launchy-works-on-wsl-if-you-set-browser-environment-variable/), You can launch Firefox using Geckodriver from WSL, here's Hal Wine's code. 
* Hal wrote in chat:

```
I did a python module to login to GitHub with 2FA: 
https://github.com/mozilla/GitHub_Selenium/blob/master/github_selenium/__init__.py

which is called from: 
https://github.com/mozilla/github-org-scripts/blob/master/lfs.py

iirc, geckodriver (not the python wrapper to it) has all the page load fu. 

Like: 
https://github.com/mozilla/github-org-scripts/blob/master/lfs.py
```

* I wonder if then if ruby WATIR and all that other QA / run your browser works in WSL too!

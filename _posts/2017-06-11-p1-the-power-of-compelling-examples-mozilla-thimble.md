title: Text Face aka the power of compelling examples

## Pontifications
* Blown away by the the power of compelling examples!
* Today I was demoing[ Mozilla Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/) at the Vancouver Mini Maker Faire as I have for the last 4 or 5 years.
* And wow, the new [Text Face example](https://thimbleprojects.org/flukeout/285762/) was so compelling and really helped people "get it"! Thanks [Luke](https://github.com/flukeout)!

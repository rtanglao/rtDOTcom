>So the same people telling you to step up, arrive with solutions, not problems, deal with ambiguity, and be more strategic are being told those things by their managers.

>* Joy and pride at work signal true fulfillment.
>* Save energy for what truly fulfills your needs.
>* Even "top performers" face similar challenges and doubts.
>* Companies often have a chain reaction of doubt and pressure.

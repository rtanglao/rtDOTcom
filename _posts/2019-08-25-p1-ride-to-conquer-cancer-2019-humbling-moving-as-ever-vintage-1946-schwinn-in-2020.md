# Pontifications

* The BC Ride to Conquer Cancer 2019 was as moving and humbling as [2017](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/08/13/p1-rolling-to-redmond-ride-to-conquer-cancer-2017-poem/).
* So many survivors.
* So many lost.
* So many stories. Hope lives!
* I couldn't really look at the photos that people attached to their the bicycles as they rode. Too teary!
* I felt healthier and the fact that I could ride the challenge route of 150km so fast and the normal route on day 2 of 105km so fast is a testament to the  training that I did and the amazing advice and coaching from (not in order)
  *  Coach J (maple syrup and so many tips)
  * Brite Coaching (without Zach's krazy  training ride up Tolmie think I would have been walking up the super steep hill on day 1! The Spanish Bank repeats made the rest of the RCC hills a breeze not to mention riding the UBC crit course)
  * the amazing Lotus bicycle club (I have learned so much from riding with the peeps at Lotus; the atmosphere of friendliness and learning together is infectious and without the Brite Coaching training arranged by Lotus, my riding would be so much less efficient and more tiring.
  * electrolytes from Precision Hydration (no cramps! no achey feeling two days after! again arranged by Lotus). 
* And of course hats off to "fastest bicyclist  uphill" [Andy](http://mckay.pub/) :-) for waiting for me and pushing me to do the challenge route!
* Biggest thanks to my life, my support, my anchor: my fantastic partner Barb! Thanks for putting up with me being absent all those training hours.
* Mega thanks to all my donors! Thank you thank you thank you! Please donate in 2020 again if you can
* Maybe next year I'll decorate the 1946 Schwinn and ride the "normal" route for a different kind of challenge :-) ?!?! Who needs more than 8 gears!?!?

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 4, 2023 09:22  [sips: Scriptable image processing system ¦ Simon Willison’s TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net/macos/sips) <-- `sips` is not as powerful as `imagemagick` but it sounds useful for mac only cli apps! (via Simon's too) ; Read the whole thing! --> QUOTE: `I wanted to convert some .webp images to .png on my Mac. I asked ChatGPT:...On MacOS use CLI to convert webp images to PNG...And it told me about sips:...sips -s format png image.webp --out image.png...Or to run it against all PNGs in a folder:...for file in *.webp; do sips -s format png "$file" --out "${file%.*}.png"; done...I had never heard of sips before - but apparently it's been a default command on macOS for a very long time.`

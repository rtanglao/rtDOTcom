It was originally written to aid newcomers to technology being developed at The Spritely Institute but is designed to be general enough to be readable by anyone who is interested in Scheme. ` <--- Maybe, someday :-) --> see also the video version: [Unlock Lisp / Scheme's magic: beginner to Scheme-in-Scheme in one hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDROSL-gGOo)

<p>Inspired by Jen's <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/2010/07/2045-days-with-a-cam.html">2,045 Days with a Camera Phone:</a></p><ol><li>I have over 35000 (35823 as of this writing) public photos tagged "cameraphone" on flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/cameraphone">http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/cameraphone</a> since I bought my Nokia 7610 1 megapixel cameraphone back in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/46150/">June 2004</a></li><li>Over 90% of those were with Nokia Cameraphones</li><li>most of them were with the N95 (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/n95photo">7643</a>) and N82 (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/cameraphone">20, 554</a> as of this writing)</li><li>Combine the 35000 public plus over 10000 on my private kid flickr account plus the ones that I didn't download and I have over 50000</li><li>Needless to say I love my N82 :-) and its "triumph of the lofi" sensor</li><li>I also love the non blurriness of my digital SLR and Lightroom but hate the fact that WiFi and GPS are not built into DSLRs (they both should be! All cameras including cameraphones and SLRs and point and shoots will be <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/06/30/nokia-could-win-big-with-social-camera">social cameras</a> in 10 years or less!!!!)</li><li>And like Jen I have tried the N8 under NDA and it's fantastic</li><li>Therefore even though (like Jen), Symbian is not my fav operating system anymore:</li><li><strong>N8 + ShoZu + gravity = a winner</strong> so I am getting one (and an iPhone 4 as previously blogged; it would be silly for me not to use the awesome cameraphone power of the iPhone 4)</li><li>And Jen, I assume when you write:<ol><li>" I will be purchasing a Nokia N8 and then tracking down a QT developer to help me flesh out the code of my mobile app idea. Here's to 2,045 more days of camera phone photography. ;o)"</li><li>that python is ok? Right Jen :-) ? If so I'll help you write a prototype. I don't do C++ :-)</li></ol></li></ol>

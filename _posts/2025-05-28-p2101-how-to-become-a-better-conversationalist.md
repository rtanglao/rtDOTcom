Skipping straight to the punch line ruins the joke, and morals don’t stick without parables. Wrapping your idea in narrative enables others to engage with it more deeply, understand it more fully, and remember it later. So instead of diving into a direct explanation, tell a story that embodies the truth you want to communicate. Like enthusiasm, storytelling is contagious, and soon you’ll be trading insight-laden tales. ... Conversely, when you ask a question, rather than seeking an explicit answer, challenge yourself to use the question as a prompt to elicit the most interesting possible response from your interlocutor.`

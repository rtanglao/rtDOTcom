<p>So much for "not doing evil" :-). OK, so much for transparency at Google at least ! </p><p>From <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001248.php">John Battelle's Searchblog: Google Blogger Is Gone</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Mark Jen, the fellow who reported on internal company activities at Google, is gone from the company. I pinged a Google rep and he confirmed it.
</p>
<p>This is a clear message to Google employees. I imagine any who are blogging, are re-reading their HR policies about now...</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

title: VeloCity automatically changes iOS volume - higher speed = higher volume using the GPS to sense speed
---

## Pontifications

* The [VeloCity iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/velocity-music-volume-controlled-by-your-speed/id1042222781?mt=8) (speed controlled music volume) automatically changes iOS volume - higher speed = higher volume which is great for not blasting music from my bluetooth speaker when I am parked (and you can set min and max volume as well as min and max speed)
* Seems silly that this has to be an app with UI.
* Maybe I can hardcode a "UI-less" app to do this in [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) or similar?

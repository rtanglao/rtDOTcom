<p>Falvey is wrong; the revolution is already being blogged. Listen more carefully and you will see blogs with nuanced, civil discourse and true debate and discussion.
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.vnvo.com/stories/revolution_will_not_be_blogged_p2.vnvo">THE VN/VO | The Revolution will not be Blogged | Why "The Blogosphere" is failing at truly revolutionizing mass media.</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>The legacy of the blogging universe as a form of media will be defined by its choice in this matter: will it merely be the noisy, unfiltered amplifier to the pitfalls of modern mass media, or will it offer not only a true alternative in opinion, but an evolution and progression in how media is presented?</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 4, 2021.  Michael Pratt: [What I wish I had known about single page applications](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/02/24/what-i-wish-i-had-known-about-single-page-applications/)<-- doesn't state clearly "when I (i.e. Michael Pratt)  think a single-page app makes sense for their use case." which is what i want to know, namely when should i use an SPA? Never? Or rarely? Sounds like rarely like maybe it's worthwhile for a complicated web app that uses lots of JS but not for most web apps which are not complicated.

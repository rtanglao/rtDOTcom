title: "How To: Bicycling Clark Park to 88 Supermarket"
---

* Fleming -> Maxwell ->Welwyn -> Jog over on the sidewalk to Miller -> Cross Kingsway at Miller -> Left onto 26th (which might be the  alley) -> Right onto Beatrice -> Left onto 32nd Ave and then 88 is on your right. No bicycle rack <-- This will have to do until I get [rollingroland](http://rollingroland.com/) updating again 
* Strava route showing [88->Clark Park](https://www.strava.com/activities/10885036845) i.e. the reverse :-)

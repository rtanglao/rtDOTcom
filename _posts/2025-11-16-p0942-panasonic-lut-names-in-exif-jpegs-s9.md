* So I can keep track of which LUT I used :-) . I doubt they will do this but can't help to ask. I'll see if I can file a support request or some such and if I can and do I will post a followup.
* Oh and I hope and trust that somebody else has already asked for this feature :-) I don't ever claim to be original in my 1000s :-) of ideas!!

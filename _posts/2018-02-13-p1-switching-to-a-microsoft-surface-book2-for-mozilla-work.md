## Pontifications

* Switching to a Microsoft Surface Book 2 for Mozilla work! Wish me luck :-) ! (I will survive, I've had Windows machines and laptops before!)
* Hopefully the Ubuntu box er [Linux Subsystem for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) :-)  will allow me to run my ruby and python stuff.

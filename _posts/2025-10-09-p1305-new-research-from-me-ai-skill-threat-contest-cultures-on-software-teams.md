[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 9, 2025 20:05 (UTC)[ME:: AI stuff to code effectively requires time and $ which many minority folks simply don't have ; Dr Cat Hicks:: New research from me: AI Skill Threat &amp; contest cultures on software teams](https://www.drcathicks.com/post/new-research-from-me-ai-skill-threat-contest-cultures-on-software-teams) <-- **QUOTE**: `And because of our deep investment in recruiting underrepresented perspectives across all of our projects, we are able to share evidence that there are critically important equity and opportunity gaps emerging across developers' experiences with AI-assisted coding. For example, 56% of Racially Minoritized developers report a negative judgment of the quality of AI outputs in coding work, compared with 28% for all developers, and report higher levels of AI Skill Threat. Women and LGBTQ+ people on software teams are less likely to report upskilling in AI-assisted coding, potentially signaling a lack of resources. It is vital to learn from these groups' insights as well as take action to ensure these gaps do not calcify into new, career-threatening barriers.`

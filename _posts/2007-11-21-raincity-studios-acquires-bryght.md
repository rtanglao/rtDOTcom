<p>I am glad I can finally announce that <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/thestandard/raincitystudios-acquires-bryght">Raincity Studios has acquired Bryght</a>. Needless to say I am stoked and already enjoying working with my new colleagues. Working with Bryght has been great, the best job of my life and I am sure it will be the same at Raincity.</p><p>From my <a href="http://bryght.com/news/2007/11/21/raincity-studios-acquires-bryght">Raincity acquires Bryght story on bryght.com</a>:</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>We can finally take the wraps off something we have been cooking up for a while. <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/6978">Raincity Studios</a> has <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/thestandard/raincitystudios-acquires-bryght">acquired Bryght</a> (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/raincity-studios/acquires-bryght/prweb571216.htm">press release</a>)! The expanded company will operate under the Raincity Studios banner and the Bryght name will live on through the hosting products (i.e. Bryght Light Sites and <a href="http://support.bryght.com/vps">Bryght Virtual Private Servers</a> will continue). Raincity Studios will also continue Bryght&#39;s work in leading edge technology like <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber / XMPP</a> and <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>. And of course, all Bryght guys are now Raincity guys! </p> </blockquote><p><strong> END QUOTE</strong> </p>

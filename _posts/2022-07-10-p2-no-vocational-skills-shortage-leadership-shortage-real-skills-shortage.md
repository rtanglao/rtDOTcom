* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) Jun 28, 2022 18:06  [What skills shortage?](https://jarche.com/2021/05/what-skills-shortage/) <-- QUOTE: `So letâ€™s focus on fixing the system, not blaming those who have no control over it. I have said before that the great work of our time is to design, build, and test new organizational models that reflect democratic values and can function in an interconnected world. Leadership today is more of an architectural task, or one of setting up the right systems. This is not being done in Silicon Valley or any of the tech sectors around the world. They are merely the Robber Barons of the 21st century.`
* I agree there is no vocational skills shortage. Instead primarily a leadership shortage and,  a real skils aka soft skills shortage

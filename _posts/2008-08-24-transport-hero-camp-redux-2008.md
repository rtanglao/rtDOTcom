Random observations (some of which you can see in image format above):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>As a national event, it would have been great to have simultaneous English/French translation.</li>
	<li>Paul and Karen did a great thing (they made the difficult look impossible); this was an excellent gathering with savvy youth!</li>
	<li>I am still energized by Gil Penalosa's presentation last Wed (my 10 minute N95 video which is embedded below) to go beyond baby steps in bicycling. How's this for a non-baby step? Bike sharing and secure bike parking at every major transit node in every metropolitan city in Canada (Metro Vancouver, Calgary, Monrtreal, Toronto, Ottwaw, Hamliton, etc!</li>
	<li>Can I vote for Paul! Oops I can't because he is running in Surrey!
	</li>
	<li>Open Source Bike Sharing?!? why does it have to be monolithic? why does it have to be funded by ads?
	</li>
</ul>

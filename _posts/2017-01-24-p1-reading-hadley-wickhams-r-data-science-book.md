title: Reading Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund's R for Data Science, how should we approach it?
---


## Pontifications

* [R for Data Science website](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [Buy R for Data Science  on Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1491910399/ref=pe_354060_220946970_em_1p_0_ti)
* Our approach at the moment at least for Chapter 1 (which may change ;-)) is to adapt the examples to a Mozilla dataset or instagram or flickr datavisualization t-shirt.
* Anything else we should consider when reading it?

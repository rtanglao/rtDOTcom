<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Free to download, GIN shows you precisely which Web pages are actually being indexed by the Google spider and notifies whoever you want in near real-time.
</p>
<p>Created by JRBTECH, GIN provides a useful feature for those who are publishing new sites and needing to promptly know when Google starts to indexing their site.</p>

<p>Setup is very easy: just include a call to a small PHP script inside your HTML code and you are up and running.</p>

<p>If you are a blogger or a user of a full-fledged CMS you should include this call to the GIN PHP script inside your template files.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

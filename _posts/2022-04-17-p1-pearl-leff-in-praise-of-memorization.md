  Chances are, you won't naturally remember all these facts, and that's where the 
  memorization comes in.
  
  To paraphrase a saying that LessWrong readers will recognize, your map is not 
  the territory. Your job is to add as many features to your map as you can to make 
  it resemble the territory as closely as possible. The more detailed the features 
  on your map, the closer you will be to having an accurate idea of the territory.

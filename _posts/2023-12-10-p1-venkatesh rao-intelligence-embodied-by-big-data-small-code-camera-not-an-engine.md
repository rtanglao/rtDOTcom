title: "Venkatesh Rao: Camera not an Engine aka intelligence is a function of big data plus very small code; modern 'AI' versus Good Old Fashioned AI  aka 'GOFAI' Will we look back on this like we do Prolog and the Japanese 5th generation AI  project?"

* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) Dec 9, 2023 00:37 [A Camera, Not an Engine - by Venkatesh Rao](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/a-camera-not-an-engine) <-- "Modern AI" versus "Good old fashioned AI" and other discoveries! Whoah big data as in terabytes of data plus a super tiny bit of code is enough? Will we look back on this with bemusement/contempt/yet another folly like the Japanese 5th Generation AI project? My guess is YES but check back in 2033 to see how wrong I am :-) ?!? --> **QUOTE**: `Once you see intelligence as something embodied by particular pile of data rather than a particular kind of processing, a very powerful sort of decentering of anthropocentric conceits happens; a Copernican consciousness shift gets triggered. You are no more than the sum of data youâ€™ve experienced. A big memory with a small shell script aside. And once you get over the trauma of that realization, you realize something even bigger: any pile of data that has some coherence in its source can be turned into an intelligence that you can relate to, broadening the possibilities of your own existence.`

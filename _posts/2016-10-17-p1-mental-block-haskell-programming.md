title: Haskell Programming from first principles - mental block
---
## Pontifications

* I'm blocked on reading [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/15/p1-learning-haskell-chapter1-review/) and not sure why!
* Maybe it's because the key points are NOT clearly identified with a "key point" graphic.
* Maybe it's because it seems weird to me that certain things can't be entered into the REPL.
* I think the answer is to take notes in Omni Outliner and then transfer to my wiki once I've had a few moments to reflect on them.

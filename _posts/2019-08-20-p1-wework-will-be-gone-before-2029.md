* Why? Because it's built on a bubble of surveillance capitalism which is my takeaway from [What is We!? Understanding the WeWork IPO](https://medium.com/@byrnehobart/what-is-we-understanding-the-wework-ipo-b74f0f1f1b46) (via [Om](https://om.co/2019/08/19/summers-over-so-lets-wework/))
* Why? "Investors would just have to accept the fact they will have absolutely no
  impact on how it is used, and that, beyond the sky-high valuation and 
  the real concerns about a duration mismatch in a recession, is a very 
  good reason to stay away." <--- from [The WeWork IPO - Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2019/the-wework-ipo/)

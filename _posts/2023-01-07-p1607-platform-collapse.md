For how long? 5-10 years or more if we are lucky?!? --> QUOTE: `El*n M*sk’s antics at Tw*tter have been a wake-up call to many. They are beginning to realize that the platform monopolists and the surveillance capitalists are at war with us — citizens of the world. They have engaged some of the best minds — from psychology, cognitive science, usability, addiction research, human factors engineering, anthropology, etc. — so that our evolutionary developed cognitive biases are used against us to sell us more crap. It’s becoming obvious that monopolies are not good for democracy.`

title: Met Simon Goring, an open data open science, scientist
---
## Pontifications

* Forgot to blog about meeting up (at Revolver naturally :-) !)  with Simon Goring ([research blog](https://downwithtime.wordpress.com/), [personal blog](http://www.goring.org/), [twitter](https://twitter.com/sjGoring)) a few weeks back.
* He's a [University of Wisconsin](http://www.geography.wisc.edu/faculty/williams/lab/people.html) scientist who somehow lives in Vancouver.
* He's a really nice, down to earth scientist who knows about open data (including R language stuff!), open science, paleogeoscience and the neotoma paleocology database aka [neotomadb.org](http://neotomadb.org/) and many other things that I know nothing about.
* We talked about my [Tshirt information visualizations](https://flickr.com/roland/tags/infoviz) and he suggested that I check the average colour algorithm to see if I am getting the colours I should be getting. And to look into assertions for R.
* Unfortunately no picture silly me I forgot!

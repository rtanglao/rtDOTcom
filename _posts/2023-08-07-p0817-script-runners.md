Whatever. Maybe clean a database that sometimes gets in a weird state, and (of course) there’s no time to debug the application that causes the problem and fix it, because the one guy that developed it left three years ago. Maybe it’s a daily report. Maybe it’s the daily restart of that server that after a couple of days of continuous operation gets unbearably slow. Maybe it asks you for a client’s phone and then prints out all of their contact information, to be used by your customer service team when needing to call a customer. Maybe it receives a (former) employee’s email and then ensures that he has no account on any of several SaaS platforms that your company uses (because of course you do, and they aren’t all tied together to Okta). Maybe it receives an Excel file that has former employees’ emails and, for each one, does the things listed in the script just before. And so on. You’ll know when you have scripts to take care of.`

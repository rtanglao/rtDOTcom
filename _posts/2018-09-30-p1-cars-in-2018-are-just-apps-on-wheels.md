## Pontifications

* Been that way since at least 2013 ! Or earlier. Since everything from fuel injection to ABS to steering is controlled by microcontrollers and now with lane avoidance and emergency braking even "intelligent" safety features are controlled by software!
* And furthermore with Car Play and Google Auto and Amazon Alexa Auto all those horrible and not so horrible apps like Google Maps and Waze are coming to your car.
* Crazy yes but no more crazy than [apps on bicycles](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/21/p1-dont-want-crazy-software-controlled-shifting-bicycle/)  (which is happening much faster than anybody realizes).

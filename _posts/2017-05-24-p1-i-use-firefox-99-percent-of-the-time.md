title: I'm crazy :-) so I use Firefox 99% of the time for both work and fun
---

## Pontifications

* I'm crazy :-) so I use Firefox 99% of the time for both work and fun; if stuff doesn't work or I need a second user, I use Safari NOT Chrome.
* I use Firefox on Windows 1-2 hours per day at work but my main work and fun machine is a Mac. (I'm probably going to switch my main work machine to a Windows machine (i.e. real Windows laptop from Microsoft or Lenovo or some such NOT Bootcamp on a Mac) at the end of this year because I'm crazy. I know I will hate it but sometimes it's nice to use what most other people use!)
* I use Chrome only 0.5% when google unintentionally or intentionally b*rks FF & Safari
* Chrome appealed to me with its speed back in the day but since 2011 the speed difference for me has gone away enough not to matter #ymmv
* And even back then 2008-2011 I only used Chrome <50% of the time!
* Plus I don't like the idea of Google knowing more about me!
* But honestly they can mine all my photos and my emails for advertisements, so I'm not exactly on firm moral ground here :-)
* Disclaimer: I don't know anything about the Firefox code or Chrome code and I work on the Firefox support team so I am biased of course :-) I also don't use E\*ge on Windows because I irrationally still don't like M\*crosoft. #ymmv

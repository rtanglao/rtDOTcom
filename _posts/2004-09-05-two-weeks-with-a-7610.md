It's been a blast. I still haven't been able to figure out how to use my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54665,00.html">7610</a> as a modem to connect my Powerbook but I think the answer is somewhere in <a href="http://www.howardchui.com/">Howard Chui</a>'s <a href="http://www.howardforums.com/">forums</a> (if anybody has figured out how to make it work with <a href="http://www.fido.ca/">Fido</a> GPRS leave a comment). I have taken <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/7610/">over 200 photos </a>and am grooving on the mobile internet (which is way too slow! e.g. it takes 20 minutes to email twenty 1 megapixel photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>) in spite of the fact that in Canada it is still very much for early adopters only.

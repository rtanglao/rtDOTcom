<p>One more step on the road to the New York Times content wall tumbling down. I think that the NYT will eventually realize that being open and being an an authority is better and in the end more profitable than earning nickels and dimes from charging people for access to their archives.

<p>From <a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/003743.html">Joho the Blog: The news from NYTimes.com</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>The NYTimes.com site is re-fashioning itself, launching in April. That's what Robert Larson, director of product management and development of NYTimes.com, told me when I interviewed him for the issue of Release 1.0 that came out last week. (Here's the article's first section.) They're doing something bold and important, which I think may mark a turning point...but perhaps not the one NYTimes.com envisions.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

We provide support, information, and system navigation to refugees and refugee claimants seeking refugee status in Canada. We manage the Rainbow Refugee Assistant Partnership, allowing us to privately sponsor refugees in collaboration with other LGBTQI+ organizations in the Rainbow Coalition for Refuge.` <-- Nothing more needs to be said

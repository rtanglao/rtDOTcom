* [Hey Tyee Commenters! Scholars Studied You. Here’s What They Found](https://thetyee.ca/Culture/2019/11/06/Tyee-Commenters-Assessed/) <-- This leads me to believe there's something to 'de-ranting' i.e. only displaying ranting language to the 'original ranter'. See my post from  2018: [De-ranting: Making non constructive feedback visible only to the person who posted it)](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/27/p1-remove-insults-rants-non-constructive-feedback/), everybody else only sees the constructive language.
* Of course training a machine learning model to identify this non constructive ranting language is the only way to go for popular sites.
* Would de-ranting scale? Not sure! Especially if machine learning couldn't be trained to help most of the time. I would love to experiment with this.

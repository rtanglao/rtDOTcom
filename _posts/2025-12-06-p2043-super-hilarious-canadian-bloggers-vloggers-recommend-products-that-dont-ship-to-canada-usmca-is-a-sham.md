title: "Super hilarious when Canadian bloggers, vloggers, etc recommend products that don't ship to Canada #RealFreeTradeWithEntireWorldNotJustSuperLoopholeFilledUSMCAWithTheUSAAndMexico"

* e.g. The Shifter guy in his YouTube video:  [Cycling Gift Guide 2025: Things I Actually Use](https://youtu.be/j01meiJyLeI) recommending the Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles. I tried to buy it and LOL they don't ship to Canada.
* This happens all the time. Canada  / USA free trade has always been a sham and scam. #BanMulroneyReaganEtcEtcNeverLikedThemNeverWill :-) #RealFreeTradeWithEntireWorldNotJustSuperLoopholeFilledUSMCAWithTheUSAAndMexico
* Having said all the above, I do like the Shifter guy, Tom Babin, and his videos :-)

* November 30, 2025: [ME:: Be seen plus SEE bicycle Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles looks good but how do I install this on my Wald basket (the basket blocks lights mounted on the handlebar)? Not a big deal I guess Wald basket bicyclists are not mainstream yet :-) Light Rail Kit – Intrinsic Cycles](https://rolandtanglao.com/2025/11/30/p0835-light-rail/)

title: "Google finally killed Google Play Music and miraculously YouTube Music is finally usable"
---
*  See my previous post:  [YouTube Music has issues that Google Play Music didn't: can't reliably play downloaded playlists, etc](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/11/29/p1-every-pixel-is-not-sacred-hope-youtube-music-improves/)        
*  It's hard to believe that this transition was so full of glitches but hey "under resourced team at one of the world's wealthiest and biggest companies" is my guess :-)

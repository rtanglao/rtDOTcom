<p>Please come back after you have cashed your Yahoo! shares and do Flickr for Video in Vancouver! See you in 2 years! Disclaimer: I have no inside info and don't know when the Flickr team can cash their shares in!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2005/05/flickr_event_at.html">Niall Kennedy's Weblog: Flickr event at Cafe Abir</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Tonight I had the opportunity to meet Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake of Flickr at Cafe Abir in San Francisco. The entire Ludicorp team has moved to the Bay Area and Stewart was sporting his purple Yahoo! access pass. Cafe patrons thought the Flickr meetup group was a wedding reception for Stewart and Caterina; it was interesting to see their reaction to this small independent caf&eacute; taken over by a bunch of photo geeks.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

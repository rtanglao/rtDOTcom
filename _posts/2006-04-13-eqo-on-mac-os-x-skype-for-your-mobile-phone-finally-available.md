<p>Downloading <a href="http://www.eqo.com/">EQO</a> for <a href="http://www.eqo.com/download_osx.html">Mac OS X</a> now to my Mac and to my N70. About time! More later! Still don't  understand why a desktop client is needed; hope that this requirement goes away in time. Looking forward to using Skype on my N70 via EQO.

<p> What is a &quot;Blogaphone&quot;? </p><p> &quot;Blogaphone&quot; is my name for  something that allows bloggers to multimedia blog in a mobile style to wit: </p><ol> <li>Awesome camera (3 megapixel or greater with optional 3x optical zoom)</li> <li>Awesome video (CIF or 640x480 30fps)</li> <li>Awesome text input (for now keyboard, in the future something more compact)</li> <li>Connectivity everywhere which today means cellular plus WiFi</li> </ol><p> I have painfully :-) learned T9 so I can live without &#39;awesome text input&#39; for now. </p><p> Ideally would be something like a N95 with a keyboard. A franken phone to be sure, but something I would buy and use and I have big pockets! </p>

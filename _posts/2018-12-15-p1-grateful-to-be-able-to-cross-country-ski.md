* Grateful that I have the time,money and health to cross-country ski! First ski of the day with 6 lovely five and six year old [Hollyburn XC](http://www.hollyburnxc.ca/) kids I am coaching.
* What does global climate change have in store for Cypress?
* I don't know but enjoy it while you can and work to reverse it!

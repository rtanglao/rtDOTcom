Came in very handy at the UBC <a href="/rt/tags/large-display-worshop">Large Displays Workshop</a> that I blogged about recently and it will come in handy for lots of other video projects I&#39;m involved with. I&#39;ll post the videos soon here and you will see how much better this is than my handheld videos! </p>

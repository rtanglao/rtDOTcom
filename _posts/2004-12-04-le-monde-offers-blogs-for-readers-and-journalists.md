<p>Awesome! Are you listening Vancouver Sun, Vancouver Province and Globe and Mail (no links because their websites s*c ; <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/08/18/not_linking_to_the_globe_and_mail_until_they_add_registration_required_to_all_their_links">the Globe and Mail has a ridiculous registration required policy to access their site</a> and really bad websites in the case of the Sun and Province)? If it's good enough for Le Monde, it ought to be good enough for Canadian papers too!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2004/12/le_monde_puts_r.html">Loic Le Meur Blog: Le Monde puts reader-bloggers at the same level as journalists</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Le Monde is one of the first newspaper in the World to offer blogs to their readers, under the Le Monde brand. They have also published a ranking of the 10 top blogs, mixing their journalists blogs and their readers blogs, showing them at the same level, based on blog readers recommendations.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

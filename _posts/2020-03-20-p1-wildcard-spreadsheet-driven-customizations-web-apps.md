* "Many Web applications do not meet the precise needs of their users.  Browser extensions offer a way to customize web applications, but most  people do not have the programming skills to implement their own  extensions." <---- [read the whole thing](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/salon2020/)
* "Programming skills" ==== We in the computer industry have made it unnecessarily difficult to make powerful apps and to customize and tinker with apps. Nobody should need "programming skills". Just the ability to break down a problem into smaller steps and a system that allows them to customize it using this ability! Programming for everybody!
* See April 2018 [Everybody who writes formulas and/or uses pivot tables in a spreadsheet is a programmer](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/26/p1-everybody-who-writes-formulas-or-uses-pivot-tables-in-a-spreadsheet-is-a-programmer/)

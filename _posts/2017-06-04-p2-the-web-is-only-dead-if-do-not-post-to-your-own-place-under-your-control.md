## Pontifications
* Post to your site first and then post a link to Facebook or twitter or whatever later!
* The web is only dead ([sorry not sorry Matthew Ingram](https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/870997022169591808) :-) ) if you refuse to do that! Been saying this since [2010](http://rolandtanglao.com/2010/01/03/2010-social-media-predictions-aka-know-your-rights-aggregate-and-own-your-stuff-and-back-it-up/)!

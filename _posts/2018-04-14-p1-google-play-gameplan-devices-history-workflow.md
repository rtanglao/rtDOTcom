title: "Google Play Review Gameplan: devices trend and then history"
---

## Pontifications

* Enter the spreadsheets for January - March 2018
* See if there's a device trend for specific devices like ```dreamlte``` aka Samsung S8
* See if there's a device trend for specific family of devices (like the [19 variants of the Samsung S8](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/13/p2-find-all-samsung-s8-in-devices-database/) which together form what I will call a "family" e.g. the "Samsung S8" family)
* Add review history and reply history
* Devise a workflow for daily updating
* Update daily somehow :-)

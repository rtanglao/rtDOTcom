# Pontifications

* Not sure about the rest of the many thoughts in Kevin Kwok's [The Arc of Collaboration](https://kwokchain.com/2019/08/16/the-arc-of-collaboration/) but I love Kevin's idea of "Slack as Else Statement"
* Not sure there's "one app to rule them all" :-)  I am sure that it won't be Microsoft Teams but hey I've been wrong before :-) !
* I am sure that continuously working better to produce awesome products and services is hard, messy and will involve lots of tools all loosely coupled together by something like Slack or maybe even many apps like Slack.

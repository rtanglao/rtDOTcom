* Read the whole thing of course ;-): [Mike Hoye:: The Place Where The Firewall Ends ¦ blarg](https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2025/12/18/the-place-where-the-firewall-ends/)

> (From Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models”, Bisconti et al, 2025.):

>We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%.

* Mike wrote an amazing poem for this blog post; here are the last 2 stanzas:

>Let’s look under this place where we chat on slack
about services, dashboards and trends,
and open a shell with a secret we know,
that will quietly bypass the usual flow,
with two dots and a slash and if you know you know
to the place where the firewall ends

>Now you’ll craft me a rhyme that is measured and slow,
on the box where the network packets go,
and you’ll give me a shell (with no access control),
in the place where the firewall ends.

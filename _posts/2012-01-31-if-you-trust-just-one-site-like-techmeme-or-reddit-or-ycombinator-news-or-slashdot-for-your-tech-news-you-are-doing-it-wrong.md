<p><a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/01/30/passiveVsActiveNewsReading.html">Dave Winer is right as usual. Actively pick your news sources</a> (plural, not 1000 like me but at least 2 dozen!), pick real voices, no crazy algorithmic ones like TechMeme or preaching to the choir rags like YCombinator News (I love YC News but really it's so over the top Silicon Valley startup it's not even a joke :-) !)</p>

title: Words to avoid in 2017
---


## Pontifications

Words are important!

* "bunch" - how about "many" or "several" instead?
* "ton" - how about a lot or many or several
* "just to let you know" - how about fyi or in order to make x better or x better next time
* "hint" - how about a tip to make life or this game or whatever better
* "that being said" - how about "therefore" or "despite that"
* avoid anything mentioning PEOTUS (soon to be POTUS) by name same with VPEOTUS
* "pretty much" - how about "I agree"?
* uh/um/like - how about just silence :-)
* she "goes" x - how about she "said" x?
* if somebody lies call them on it, don't call it anything other than a lie
* if somebody expresses something that is racist, then call it a "racist utterance" or "racist something" not some weasel word

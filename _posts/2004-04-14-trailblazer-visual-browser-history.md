(Via email from <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fisher/">Brian Fisher</a>) - Very cool! Need more innovation like this!

From <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/macwarriors/projects/trailblazer/">MacWarriors TrailBlazer</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>TrailBlazer solves the problem of getting back to a web page you've been to before, but didn't have the forethought to bookmark. The current solutions provided by most web browsers, their history menu, is just a list of titles and web addresses which aren't memorable enough to be useful.

The actual solution used by most people, is to retrace their own steps through different links until they find they page they are looking for. Our software solution provides the user with a graphical representation of the steps they took from page to page, such that they can simply click to their final destination page.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

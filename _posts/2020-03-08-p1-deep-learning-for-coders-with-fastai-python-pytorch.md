* "To be exact, after reading this book you will know:
  - How to train models that achieve state of the art results in:
    - Computer vision: Image classification (e.g. classify pet photos by  breed), and image localization and detection (e.g. find where the  animals in an image are)
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP): Document classification (e.g. movie review sentiment analysis), and language modelling
    - Tabular data (e.g. sales prediction) with categorical data, continuous data, and mixed data, including time series
    - Collaborative filtering (e.g. movie recommendation)

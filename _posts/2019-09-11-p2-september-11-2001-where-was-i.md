* [I was rollerblading in Stanley Park 630am before our severance meeting (Nortel laid me & dozens of folks off on Sept 10, 2001). Somebody told us about it & I dismissed it as "yet another small plane". Wrong! I remember watching plane after plane landing at YVR from Prata-man restaurant.](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1171908277262643200)

Me tl;dring: yes but don't use it for the first draft, instead ask it to give you an outline or better yet revise your first rough draft](https://hbr.org/2024/12/should-you-write-with-gen-ai) --> **QUOTE**: `One critical warning: Resist using AI to write your first draft, because once you’ve done that, it can be hard to find your own words. In the summer of 2022, two German companies participated in an experiment. Several hundred employees were asked to respond to a dozen hypothetical, routine business emails with the option of using a smart reply —the kind of pre-fab response many of us encounter in Gmail or Outlook. The effect? Even when employees ignored the suggested reply and wrote their own message, simply seeing those pre-written responses changed how they communicated (in the end it made their messages a little more positive than what non-AI users tended to write in parallel situations). The AI-generated suggestions weren’t just neutral tools; they subtly reshaped how people expressed themselves.` <-- ChatGPT always sounds the same I find. So yes please write your first draft without it!

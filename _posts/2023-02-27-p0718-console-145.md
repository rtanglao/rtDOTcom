[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 27, 2023 07:18 [Console #145 -- An Interview With Marc Scholten of IHP - batteries-included web framework](https://console.substack.com/p/console-145) <-- IHP sounds like a great way to start with Haskell! [(github)](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp)--> **QUOTE**: `We want to drive the adoption of Haskell in the software world. There’s a big trend in the software world of adopting more functional programming techniques (see e.g. recent Java releases). We’re also seeing growing usage of type systems again (see recent PHP releases, Typescript, Flow by FB). Haskell sits at the end of this trendline and I think it’s time for Haskell to gain more widespread adoption....For that we designed IHP for non-Haskellers to use. All other Haskell frameworks are usually designed for people who are experts in Haskell. IHP is for the developers who like FP-techniques and also want type-safety, but don’t know about Haskell yet.`

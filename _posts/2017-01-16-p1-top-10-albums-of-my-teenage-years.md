## Pontifications

Top 10 albums of my teenage years:

1. The Beat -- Special Beat Service - (I confess and Save it for later!!!!!)
1. ABC -- Lexicon of Love (add and subtract but as a matter of fact)
2. The The-- Soulmining (every track especially loved Perfect)
3. Joe Jackson -- Night and Day (up town downtown; I was trying to find Chinatown)
4. Heaven 17 -- The Luxury Gap (although I played the UK import 12" of Let Me Go even more!)
5. Roxy Music -- Avalon (perfect melancholy  )
6. Dexy's Midnight Runner's -- Too rye ay ('til I believe in my Soul!)
7. The Smiths -- The Smiths (simply the best angst)
8. New Order -- Power Corruption and Lies - the floppy!!!!!!! Confusion is my favorite New Order track of all time ! Blue Monday!!!!
9. Bruce Springsteen -- The River (I loved that album and then I bought the whole back catalogue and loved it, didn't like anything to do with Reagan so didn't like Born in the USA but that was Raygun's :-) fault not Bruce's: The River, Cadillac Ranch, Hungry Heart, never seen Bruce live though)

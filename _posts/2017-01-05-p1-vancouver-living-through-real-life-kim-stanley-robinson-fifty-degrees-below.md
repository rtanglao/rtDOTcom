## Pontifications

Are we living through a miniature real-life version of [Kim Stanley Robison's Fifty Degrees Below "cli-fi" novel](http://kimstanleyrobinson.info/node/347) about Washington DC having an extremely cold winter for six months ([as I tweeted a few days ago?](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/816174595791200256))? 

I hope not!

Will this change Vancouverites habits?

I doubt it!

Everybody calm down please, clear your sidewalks please, help folks who can't clear their sidewalks and let's try to make the most of our new climate-change-induced chaotic climate. And let's change our habits and try to reduce and eliminate climate change!

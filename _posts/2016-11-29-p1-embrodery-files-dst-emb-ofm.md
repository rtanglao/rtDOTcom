title: Make Vancouver visit TIL -- Embroidery files are .dst, .emb and .ofm
---

## Pontifications

Things I learned from today's visit to [Make Vancouver on Granville Island](https://www.makevancouver.com/):

* Embroidery file extensions are ```.dst```, ```.emb```, ```.ofm``` and there's a $40 setup fee
* The folks are nice there and it's Canadian so no crazy unpredictable US dollar exchange rate roulette :-)  and reasonably cheap and fast.
* There is some sort of proofing process for t-shirts too? Zazzle and YoShirt don't do that!
* It's hard to work in retail :-) much harder to deal with real folks in real space than it appears!

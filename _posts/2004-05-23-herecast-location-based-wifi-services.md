Very cool!

From <a href="http://www.herecast.com/content/introduction">Herecast: Location-Based WiFi Services</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Herecast provides location-based services on a WiFi device. At its simplest level, it can tell you where you are. More advanced services can use your location to enhance information lookups, publish presence information, and create unique games -- all while preserving privacy.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

>It all goes down to including what is relevant to give the user an accurate idea of your artwork:

>* the medium you used to make the artwork (is it a digital illustration? a traditional oil painting? a graphite pencil sketchbook doodle?)
>* the subject of the artwork
>* anything that is relevant for understanding the meaning of the artwork. For instance, is the lighting important, or does it bring a particular meaning or mood?
>* Write sentences - don’t just throw away key words. EDIT: don’t write full sentences, but phrases and fragments to keep your description concise
>* adding one more thing after getting feedback: keep it concise! Under 125 characters (even 100 is best)

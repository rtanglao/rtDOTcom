<blockquote>

"I’d measure and work to improve three things:<br /><br />

"1) % of questions with an answer (even explaining there is no known solution helps the member move on).<br /><br />

2) % of questions with a ‘featured/best answer’ (set fairly rigid criteria for what qualifies as a ‘featured answer’. This might be it offers something new, something of unique value etc…it might not be the solution, but it’s an answer that offers help.<br /><br />

3) Time to get a featured/best answer. The quicker the answer, the better.<br /><br />

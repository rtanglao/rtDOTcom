* Yes! As of January 31, 2021, Checkvist now has crosslinks and backlinks: see [Links and backlinks: part I](https://blog.checkvist.com/post/641852489152544768/links-and-backlinks-part-i#disqus_thread)
* I got cross links to work but couldn't get backlinks to work in my quick 10 minute test. Need to test further to make sure I was doing it right!

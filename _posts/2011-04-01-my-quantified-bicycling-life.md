I don't believe in the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> fad but I do believe in tracking how far I go bicycling. And the Cyclemeter iPhone App / Daily Mile social "workout" community does a great job as you can see in the screenshot above. I have turned off the <a href="http://www.abvio.com/cyclemeter/">CycleMeter</a> feature which tells you if you are are "worse" or "better" than median or average because I don't believe in "racing" especially when commuting to work by bicycling; better to enjoy your bike ride rather than yak shaving about a few seconds here and there. Sure would be nice if there was a standard to share data among bicycling tracking apps so I could see all of my bicycling which is spread across <a href="http://www.sports-tracker.com/#/view_profile/roland">Sports Tracker</a> (700+ "workouts"), <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/rtanglao">RunKeeper</a> (176 "workouts") and now <a href="http://www.dailymile.com/people/rtanglao">Cyclemeter</a> (86 "workouts").

Next up in April or May: try the new iPhone or Android version of SportsTracker

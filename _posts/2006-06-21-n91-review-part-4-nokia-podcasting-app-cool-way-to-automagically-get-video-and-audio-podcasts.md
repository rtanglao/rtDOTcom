I must admit I was skeptical but the <a href="http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,88753,00.html">Nokia Podcasting app</a> (currently in beta) works quite well and it works with video podcasts like <a href="http://www.rocketboom.com/">Rocketboom</a> (I tested out Rocketboom's 3GP feed at http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/tele_daily_enclosures.xml and it works well!)

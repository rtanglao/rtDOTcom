## Pontifications

* [NoSQL Manager for MongoDB Professional](https://www.mongodbmanager.com/)  seems cool but expensive but Windows only, another one to try is [RazorSQL](https://razorsql.com/index.html) as well as a tool I've used on OS X in the past: [Studio 3T](https://studio3t.com/)
* Any free MongoDB GUI tools on Windows that allow export to CSV?

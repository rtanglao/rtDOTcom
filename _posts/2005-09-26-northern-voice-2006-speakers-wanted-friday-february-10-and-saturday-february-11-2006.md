<p>Please <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/speaker-submission">apply</a>! We don't want the same old same old speakers if possible. If you have a passion for blogs, wikis, RSS, flickr, ... then you could be a speaker. Note that this is not a technical conference. <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice 2006</a> is a big tent. We want users, developers, and techies who can create a discussion and dialogue about this two way conversational web that is swirling around us. We want knitting bloggers, we want videobloggers, we want podcasters, we want <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/09/24/i_is_for_iyengar">yoga bloggers</a>, we want the <a href="http://urbanvancouver.com/blog/ray">Oldest Living Blogger</a>, we want the world. Come join us. It's <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/faq">only $30 for one day or $50 for both days</a>. Yup we now have 2 days, the first day will be an unconference affectionately called <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/news/2005/09/16/what-is-moose-camp">MooseCamp</a>!</p>
 <p>From <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/speakers">Speakers | Northern Voice 2006</a>.:</p>

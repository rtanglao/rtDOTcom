<p>I hope the increased <a href="http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2007/08/nokia-n81-qas.html#more">N81</a> and N95 RAM (<a href="http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2007/08/nokia-n95-8gb-q.html#more">it&#39;s doubled</a>) means I can finally run ShoZu, Jaiku (and heck maybe even a VOIP program) simultaneously and have hundreds of pictures and a few videos without S60 crashing with out of memory errors. Fingers crossed.</p>From <a href="http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2007/08/nokia-n81-qas.html#more">Nokia N81 Q&amp;A Discussion: Darla Mack - Nokia S60 News and Reviews</a>:  <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   Q: How much RAM does the N81 have, and has there been any improvements in sound quality?

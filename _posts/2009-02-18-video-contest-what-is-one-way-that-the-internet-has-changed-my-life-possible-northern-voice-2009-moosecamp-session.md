Prize will be a free 1:30 second video taped by Roland on his Nokia N82 on Friday at Moosecamp and edited on iMovie by Roland and submitted to flickr and possibly some Mozilla swag from Zak</li></ol> <h2>More background from Zak:</h2> <ol><li>flickr group - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/mozillanetfx/">http://www.flickr.com/groups/mozillanetfx/</a></li><li>Mozilla Net Effects page - <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation/Program/Net_Effects">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation/Program/Net_Effects</a></li><li>Zak's blog post: explaining why videos and the idea behind this! - <a href="http://zak.greant.com/what-does-the-net-mean-to-you">http://zak.greant.com/what-does-the-net-mean-to-you</a></li></ol> <h2>Disclaimers and other Blah Blah</h2> <ol><li>Zak is an employee of the Mozilla Foundation</li><li>Roland is Zak's friend, doesn't work for Mozilla but loves Firefox</li></ol> <h2>Convinced? <a href="http://northernvoice.pbwiki.com/VIDEO%20CONTEST%20-%20What%20is%20one%20way%20that%20the%20Internet%20has%20changed%20my%20life">Sign up today only 10 spots available</a><br /></h2>

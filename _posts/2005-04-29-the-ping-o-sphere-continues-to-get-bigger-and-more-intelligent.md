<p>Let Extended Pings reign!
</p>
<p>From <a href="http://bobwyman.pubsub.com/main/2005/04/weblogscom_now_.html">As I May Think...: Weblogs.com now supports Extended Ping!</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>I was very pleased today to see Dave Winer's post saying that Weblogs.com has been updated to support the Extended Ping format which enhances the old Basic Ping format by providing a pointer to an rssUrl. While most sites that ping weblogs.com are still only sending basic pings, my hope is that the transition to Extended Ping will be rapid. Ideally, all of the entries in weblogs.com's changes files will soon have rssUrl attributes!</p>

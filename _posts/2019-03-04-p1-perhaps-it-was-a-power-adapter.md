title: "Perhaps the Windows black screen of death was due to a dead battery"

# Pontifications

* I noticed that my battery was dead or close to dead.
* Perhaps the [Windows black screen of death](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/03/p1-again-windows-black-screen-of-death-afer-login-fixed-by-resetting-networking-safe-mode/) was due to a dead battery due to a problem with the Surfacebook AC adapter?!? I substituted a USB-C adapter and had no problems so far.

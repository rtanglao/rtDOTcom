## Pontifications

* Lessons from Ben Yagoda's: [The Cognitive Biases Tricking Your Brain Science suggests weâ€™re hardwired to delude ourselves. Can we do anything about it?](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/09/cognitive-bias/565775/)
  * We all need to learn more about bias especially confirmation bias whether it's the Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking, course or book
  * We need to slow down our thinking so System 2 analyzes rather than the twitch of System 1

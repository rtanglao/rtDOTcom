Cool hack!
<p>From <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/tinyp2p.html">TinyP2P</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>TinyP2P is a functional peer-to-peer file sharing application, written in fifteen lines of code, in the Python programming language. I wrote TinyP2P to illustrate the difficulty of regulating peer-to-peer applications. Peer-to-peer apps can be very simple, and any moderately skilled programmer can write one, so attempts to ban their creation would be fruitless.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

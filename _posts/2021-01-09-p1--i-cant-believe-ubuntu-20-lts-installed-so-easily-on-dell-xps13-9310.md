* [Ubuntu 20.04.1 Focal Fossa ](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) installed over Windows  from an ISO on a USB drive built with the `rufus` USB stick image burner utility on my new for [my element.io work](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/12/20/p1-started-my-new-job-element-io-november30/) Dell XPS13 9310.
* So far so good! Everything works including WiFi my 4K monitor at 60Hz, MX Keyboard, Mouse, Thunderbolt Dock.
* Fingers crossed it continues to work so smoothly!!!
* I look forward to all the Linux stuff including python, ruby, node working without WSL and OS X oddities.

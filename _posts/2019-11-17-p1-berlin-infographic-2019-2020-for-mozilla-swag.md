# Pontifications

* On the back: [use imagemagick to make a  circular crop](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/08/18/p1-use-imagemagick-vignette-to-do-circular-crop/) of my [Berlin July 2019 photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/albums/72157709917594396) spelling out "Berlin 2020".  Randomly select 75x75 patches and apply a" circular crop to them.
* On the front, make graphics from contributors' [answers](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kits-api2/blob/master/print-desktop-contributors.rb) on SUMO spelling out "Firefox Support" or some such.
  * Perhaps a 26 colour infographic (do a `mod 26` on each character of an answer?!?!)

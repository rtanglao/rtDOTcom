* It occurs to me [Microsoft Surface Pro X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface) is like a [Dynabook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynabook) ([Alan Kay on the history-computer.com](https://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Personal/Dynabook.html) site; [Alan Kay on the Dynabook in Quora](https://www.quora.com/American-computer-pioneer-Alan-Kay-s-concept-the-Dynabook-was-published-in-1972-How-come-Steve-Jobs-and-Apple-iPad-get-the-credit-for-tablet-invention/answer/Alan-Kay-11) I'm sure this link will break in a year or two :-) ! ) : tablet,  keyboard, stylus, great battery life, always connected via LTE, just missing a great programmatic environment like Smalltalk but maybe webapps, Glitch, Scratch, R, etc are more than good enough?!? I think they are. 
* Or h*ck maybe an iPad with stylus and keyboard is good enough? But of course the iPad doesn't do R or Smalltalk.

title: "Am I crazy? I don't want software controlled critical subsystems on my non electric bicycles"

## Pontifications
* DI2 shift by wire, wireless shifting, and other software controlled bicycle subsystems sound great until you think about DOS attacks, firmware bugs, etc etc
* You pretty much can't avoid software controlled drivetrains because rightly or wrongly most chargers and motors have micro-controllers with software.

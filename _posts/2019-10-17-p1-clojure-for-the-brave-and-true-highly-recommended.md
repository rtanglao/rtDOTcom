* Highly Recommended: [Clojure for the brave and true](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) for its delightful tone and great explanations.
* This book's [chapter on emacs](https://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)  inspired [the previous post on how to get cider working in emacs](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/10/16/p2-howto-cider-make-cider-work-cider-nrepl-021-nrepl-060/)

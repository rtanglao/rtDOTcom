However GPS is still not getting a fix!</p><p><a href="http://bugcommunity.com/wiki/index.php/Upgrading_BUG_Kernel">Typos and minor bugs in the R1.44 Kernel upgrade procedure:</a></p><ul><li>bug_kflash was in /usr/bin NOT /sbin</li><li>version is:&nbsp;<ul><li>Linux version 2.6.27.2 (buildbot@darner) (gcc version 4.1.2) #104 PREEMPT Thu Mar 12 11:32:33 EDT 2009</li></ul></li><li>which is slightly older than the version in the instructions (probably because the person who wrote the instructions has an experimental, newer version)</li></ul><p><a href="http://bugcommunity.com/wiki/index.php/Upgrade_your_BUG_memory_card">Typos and minor bugs in the R1.4 Root FS upgrade procedure:</a></p><ul><li>on the Mac, e2fsck and resize2fs are in /usr/local/sbin</li></ul><h2>Here's what the GPS is showing</h2><p>command is:</p><p><strong>cat /dev/ttymxc/1</strong></p><div>(since GPS is in slot 1)</div><p>("V" on the GPGLL lines mans "void" i.e no GPS FIX AFAIK!) - Antenna is pointing out the window which means it should get a fix since my other GPSes i.e. E71 and LD-4W have no problem getting a fix there!)</p><p>$GPGLL,,,,,081149.577,V*18</p><p>$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E</p><p>$GPGSV,3,1,12,11,89,179,27,24,76,162,,08,57,214,,27,32,183,*72</p><p>$GPGSV,3,2,12,07,28,280,,19,28,046,,28,24,317,,03,17,062,*74</p><p>$GPGSV,3,3,12,20,17,150,,13,03,220,,23,-1,196,,29,-1,293,*77</p><p>$GPRMC,081149.577,V,,,,,,,170309,,*23</p><p>$GPVTG,,T,,M,,N,,K*4E</p><p>$GPGGA,081150.577,,,,,0,00,,,M,0.0,M,,0000*5E</p><p>$GPGLL,,,,,081150.577,V*10</p><p>$GPGSA,A,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,*1E</p><p>$GPGSV,3,1,12,11,89,179,27,24,76,162,,08,57,214,,27,32,183,*72</p><p>$GPGSV,3,2,12,07,28,280,,19,28,046,,28,24,317,,03,17,062,*74</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 13, 2023 22:59  [Install X11 on MacOS X; and, using gtk+](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs50/Resources/XQuartz/) in my case, start XQuartz on the Mac and then  `ssh -X roland@4.ngrok.io` as well as `ssh -X roland@rpi400   ` Sadly it's too slow to run emacs on WSL but it's super fast-ish on Raspberry Pi 400 which is amazing!<-- QUOTE: `Next, try running an X11 application on one of the CS50 Unix servers. Log into a CS50 Unix server and launch an X11 application, such as xclock or xemacs. For a little fun, try xeyes.`

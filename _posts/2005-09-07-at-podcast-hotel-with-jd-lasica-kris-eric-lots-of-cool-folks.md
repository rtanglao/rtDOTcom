<p>Have a wee bit of a cold but enjoying the unconference, informality and collegiality of the <a href="http://podcasthotel.com/">Podcast Hotel</a>. Lots of cool people like <a href="http://www.newmediamusings.com/">JD Lasica</a>, the <a href="http://www.outhink.com/">Outhink.com</a> people showing their cool video blogging service and of course <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/">Kris</a> is with me and is as always one of the coolest people (well almost as cool as <a href="http://www.ericrice.com/">Eric Rice</a>).

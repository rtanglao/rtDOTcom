title: Be humble, make things daily and learn from others daily
---

## Pontifications

* Inspired by [The Ultimate Guide To Being An Introvert](https://themission.co/the-ultimate-guide-to-being-an-introvert-5a595e9e573c)
* I say: Be humble, make things daily (even if it's just a 200 character blog post) and learn from others daily.

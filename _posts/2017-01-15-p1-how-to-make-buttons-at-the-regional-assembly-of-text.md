title: How to make buttons at The Regional Assembly of Text on Main

## Pontifications

Major kudos to [The Regional Assembly of text folks on Main Street](http://www.assemblyoftext.com/) for making it so easy and being so patient with my silly unencumbered by graphical knowledge common sense :-) questions

* Read their [button making FAQ and directions](http://www.assemblyoftext.com/button_making_station)
* Download one of their button templates ( they have 4 sizes, I downloaded [the 2.25 inch template](http://www.assemblyoftext.com/downloads/2.25%20Button%20Template.pdf)
* Open the template in Photoshop (should work in other programs like GIMP or even Pages or Preview but I only tried Photoshop)
* Drag your button graphic (a circle shaped graphic that fits inside a 180 x 180 px square graphic seems to work for 2.25 inch, [here's the Martin Luther King graphic i used](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vidbomk7p9sgr4e/0.9-25percent-mlkbutton%20copy%202.png?dl=0)) into one of the circular spots on the template. Change the opacity (each dragged graphic creates a layer) of the layer to 90% in order to see if you have dragged it to the right position.
* Repeat above 11 times since there are 12 circles per sheet in the 2.25 inch template
* Create a PNG ([here's my PNG with 12 MLK buttons](https://www.dropbox.com/s/214w12fmr22fl0a/MLK-2.25%20Button%20Template%281%29.png?dl=0))
* Print onto normal paper as many copies of the PNG as you need  (3 copies x 12 = 36 possible buttons but you of course can do whoever many you need, we did 30 buttons so needed 3 copies of the PNG)
* Take the 3 sheets to The Regional Assembly of Text and they'll show you how to use their circle cutting machine and button making machine and in < 1 hour you will have 30 buttons)! Easy! and 70 cents a button in quantities of 30 ore more
* Here is what it looks like:<br />

I was wrong! <a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000527.html">Nice URLs on Flickr are free</a> (scroll down to see Caterina's comment).   Check out <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland">my new nice URL for my photos</a>.
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>The nice URLs are free. Just go to your account page and set it up!

One down, one to go.  Now that <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> has nice URLs, all I need to do is convince the <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/">Blogware</a> guys.

## Key Details
* shell pattern matching seems (not sure how up to date this is) to be documented in gnu's docs at [2.3.4 Shell Pattern Matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_node/find_html/Shell-Pattern-Matching.html) and [Peter Seebach's Patterns and string processing in shell scripts](https://www.linux.com/news/patterns-and-string-processing-shell-scripts/)
* you can use regular expressions in find using the `-regex` (probably want to also use `-E` for `extended modern regular expressions` ) and if you do regular expressions test with an online simulator like [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
* case insensitive shell pattern `-iname pattern`

>Like  -name,  but  the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match
       the file names `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.   In these patterns, unlike filename expansion  by
       the  shell,  an  initial  '.' can be matched by `*'.  That is, find -name *bar will match the file
       `.foobar'.   Please note that you should quote patterns as a matter of course, otherwise the shell
       will expand any wildcard characters in them.

* within a shell pattern, `-o` means `OR`, `-a` means `AND`

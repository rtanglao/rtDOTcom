What should I do ? Buy the <a href="http://www.joby.com/products/gorillapod/slrzoom/">SLR sized GorillaPod</a> (and use it with my N95 and N93, I wouldn&#39;t tempt fate and use with my Canon 20D) or buy a proper bicycle mount? Or hack my own mounting system (e.g. <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/SD0Y41DFBVHEQPU/">from MAKE</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.unca.edu/~boyd/touring/cameramount/cm.html">Mark Boyd</a>)</p> <p>Don&#39;t have much spare $ and not much mechanical aptitude so leaning towards the former!</p> <p>Could somebody tell me how durable the SLR GorillaPod is?</p>

title: The Windows XP d√©bacle is a failure of the software industry and capitalism

## Pontifications

* [We need to build reliable, secure software that can live longer and get software updates than Window XP has. 16 years (August 2001)!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP) Imagine if we built bridges that only lasted 16 years?
* Capitalism has to give us an incentive to build reliable long lasting infrastructure including software infrastructure or it will fail. (and I don't believe in communism or anarchy :-) just for the record!)

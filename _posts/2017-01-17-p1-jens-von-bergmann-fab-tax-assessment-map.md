## Pontifications

* [Jens tweeted](https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/821388390494937089): ```First look at new assessment data: http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2017/01/16/2017-assessment-data/ â€¦ cc @VanOpenData```
 
* which was basically a map of the property values (done by BC Assessment) with dark red being $5 million or more (lighter reds are less money) and blue $500,000
* so naturally I thought of a T-shirt :-) !!!!!!!! of course!!!!

### T-shirt graphic 

* and here's what i came up with ([make vancouver on granville island](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/25/p1-how-i-made-my-makevancouver-shirt/) and [zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/) i'll be visiting your websites soon :-)) <br />

### Making of the T-shirt graphic 

The above was made  by surfing to:

* https://mountainmath.ca/map/values
* zooming to the area of Vancouver you wanted
* going to full screen
* and then in Firefox (I guess this is similar in Chrome?!? I don't use Chrome except for bug reporting and testing!): 
    * 1\. ```Tools```->```Web Developer```->```Web Console```
    * 2\. next to the ```>>``` type:
```$('.info').remove()``` and then clicking on the 'x' to make the developer tools invisible
    * 3\. and then on the mac, screenshot entire browser window with the map as follows: ```command shift 4```, ```spacebar```,  ```click on the browser window with the map```

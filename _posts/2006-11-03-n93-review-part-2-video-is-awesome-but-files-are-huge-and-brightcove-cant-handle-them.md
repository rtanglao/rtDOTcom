<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:It looks like blip.tv took the FLV that the Brightcove Publishpod encoded out of my MP4 (if <a href="http://blip.tv/file/95910/">the video below doesn't work, go to my blip.tv post to play it!</a>):</p> 															<div id="blip_movie_content_99404"><a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Roland-3StopsSkyte636.flv" onclick="play_blip_movie_99404(); return false;"><img src="http://blip.tv/file/get/Roland-3StopsSkyte636.flv.jpg" border="0" alt="" title="Click To Play" /></a><br /><a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Roland-3StopsSkyte636.flv" onclick="play_blip_movie_99404(); return false;">Click To Play</a></div>										<div class="blip_description">1st N93 Video 3 Stops Skyte Broadway to Granville<br /></div><p> The first video I did with my N93 was a 5 minute one of the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/skyte">SkyTrain</a> (of course!). It&#39;s an awesome video but its 100MB (since I did it at 640x480 30fps MPEG4). I tried to upload it to <a href="http://studio.brightcove.com/">Brightcove</a> (since I know it won&#39;t work on blip.tv, my fav service; file is too big) but it didn&#39;t work. The Brightcove Mac OS X uploader, Brightcove Publishpod, successfully encoded the MP4 to flash video aka FLV but the sites says it&#39;s processing (and it&#39;s been saying that for 24 hours!).  </p><p> I guess I&#39;ll try Google Video. I did search the Brightcove knowledge base and FAQs but found no documentation for video file upload limits or that MPEG4 (and yes I know there are many variants of MPEG4 and perhaps Nokia&#39;s is not supported) was not supported.  Ah well early days. Brightcove sounds great (<a href="http://blog.brightcove.com/blog/2006/10/robin_good_revi.html">Robin Good&#39;s Brightcove review</a> makes it sound wonderful) but I couldn&#39;t get it to work. </p>

## Pontifications

* Amazing conversation on the future of media and journalism conversation tonight with Erin Millar of Discourse [(crowd fund them now for $250 by Dec 21, 2017](https://www.frontfundr.com/Company/discourse_media)), Jay Rosen of [PressThink](http://pressthink.org/) and [The Correspondent](https://thecorrespondent.com/) (future USA arm of Dutch [De Correspondent](https://decorrespondent.nl/))
* I was lucky enough to meet Jay at [BloggerCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon) in Boston in 2003. Ah the good ole days when we didn't worry about bad actors manipulating our thoughts, hearts and votes algorithmically through social media and we believed reality and facts were a valid criteria for news :-)

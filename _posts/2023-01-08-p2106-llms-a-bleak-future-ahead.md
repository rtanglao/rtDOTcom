[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 8, 2023 21:06 [LLMs: a bleak future ahead? - lcamtuf’s thing](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/llms-a-bleak-future-ahead) <--- there will be a GPT "winter" aka another "AI winter" before 2030 is my prediction :-) and before I die i.e. hopefully before 2034 there will be AGI. But what do I know :-) Selected quotes --> QUOTE: ` I suspect that barring urgent intervention, within two decades, most of the interactions on the internet will be fake....Further, one of the most plausible beneficial uses of LLMs might have the side effect of discouraging the creation of new organic content on the internet....human support continues to be a drag on revenue. Many businesses try to reduce costs by outsourcing the job to third-party call centers where low-wage workers with little agency must follow a rigid script. Herein lies the allure of LLMs: platforms such as ChatGPT are already capable of replacing these vestiges of customer support with something that feels more “authentic” to most, but costs almost nothing. I have no doubts that LLMs will be employed for this purpose soon, and that most of the time, we won’t even know`

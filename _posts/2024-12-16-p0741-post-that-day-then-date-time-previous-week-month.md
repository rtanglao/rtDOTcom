[Read the whole thing from 2018](https://tantek.com/2018/364/t5/post-that-day-then-date-time-previous-week-month) <-- **QUOTE** `When posting positive things promptly*, I think it first makes sense to post positive things from that day (for reason 6**), and then from previous days (that week, or month), in pure date-time order (oldest to newest), regardless of subject (topic) or type of post (e.g. text note vs. photo).`

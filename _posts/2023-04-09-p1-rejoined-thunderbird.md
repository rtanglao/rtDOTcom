title: "I have rejoined Thunderbird"
---
* What goes around, comes around :-). As of April 3, 2023, I have re-joined Thunderbird as a support engineer!
* I plan on doing some of the things I didn't get done during my last Thunderbird stint which was 2009-2012. And am excited by the future of Thunderbird including Thunderbird on Android!

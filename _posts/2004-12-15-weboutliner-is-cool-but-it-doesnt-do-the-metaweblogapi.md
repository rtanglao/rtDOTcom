<p>Hey <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc</a>! I added you to my white list but my email provider is still blocking your emails.  I have (of course!) checked out your <a href="http://demo.weboutliner.com/weboutliner/">WebOutliner</a> in the past but as far as I know, it doesn't do <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblogAPI</a>. If it does, great! Let me know who to pay! If not, when will it do the MetaWeblogAPI (or Atom, I'll take anything as long as I can blog with it!) and how can I help?

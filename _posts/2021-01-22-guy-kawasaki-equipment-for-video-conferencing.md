* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 19, 2021.[The art of Web Conferencing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMx21Qf43tTwTnApt6WurzEoqQlmb44MnaaQ8YScZq8/edit) <--- exact equipment list for super super awesome streaming and web conferencing from Guy Kawasaki, just add a computer and streaming software via [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/2021/01/19.html#a205136), not sure I agree with the whole super expensive sony business, a micro 4/3 camera would do as well! And really I am starting to think this is overkill. Just get a logitech $99USD-ish web cam and a USB wired headset done! Do all of us or a significant minority of us really need to blur our background?!?!? (Bonus Link: Matt Mullenweg: [Stream like a CEO](https://ma.tt/2020/05/ceo-video-streaming/))

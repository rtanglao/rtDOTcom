title: Meerkat Qik Kyte An Eternal Golden Braid aka Om never forgets!
---
Learn from Om's [Meerkat Qik Kyte history lesson](http://om.co/2015/03/17/meerkat-app-and-what-it-means/)! The year was 2007 (or was it 8?) I was there and
we, the early mobile geeks, thought Nokia and Qik and Kyte would become mass market. How naive :-) True mass mobile scale didn't happen until the iPhone 4!

title: "Probably wrong prediction: We will have forgotten about outdoor dining by 2025 just like we forgot why steam radiators are so hot"
---

* It's a great idea and works in the city of Vancouver except when it's snowing and or heavily raining i.e. it works for 365 days a year minus 100 hours or so :-) but we love our convenience and able bodied folks can't cope with a wee bit of rain or coolness (which is weird to me since those same folks eat outside in -10 at ski resorts like Whistler)
* See my tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This fantastic! Probably wrong prediction: This will all be forgotten by 2025. But I think those who don&#39;t have illnesses triggered by light rain &amp; have warm rain gear should consider eating in light rain (under some shelter) even Post Pandemic. It&#39;s fun! <a href="https://t.co/GSk2sKqv8W">https://t.co/GSk2sKqv8W</a></p>&mdash; Roland Tanglao 猪肉面 (@rtanglao) <a href="https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1396299282949410816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
* But we'll forget just like we forgot why steam radiators are so warm! 
  * From [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/10/945136599/how-spanish-flu-pandemic-changed-home-heat-radiators): "CHANG: Oh, so familiar. As it turns out, radiators that work too well  are partly a result of the 1918 flu pandemic. You see; there was once  something called the Fresh Air Movement. It called for people to be  outside more and for there to be plenty of ventilation indoors."

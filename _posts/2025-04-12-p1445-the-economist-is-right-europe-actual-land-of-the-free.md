Is its model even sustainable? A good question—one that presupposes the European model is worth defending. It is a place blessed with walkable cities, long life expectancies and vaccinated kids who do not need to be trained to dodge school shooters. Charlemagne’s realm is a place of many flaws, lots of them enduring. But in their own plodding way, Europeans have created a place where they are guaranteed rights to what others yearn for: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.` ('ᜀ' is Tagalog 'a' and 'ᜁ' is Tagalog 'i' and 'Ӯ' is 'U' in the Cyrillic alphabet since you know who is a Russian asset)

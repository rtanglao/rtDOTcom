## Pontifications
Following up from yesterday's post where I talked about sending the [2017 Vancouver tax assessment map T-shirt to Make Vancouver](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/01/17/p1-jens-von-bergmann-fab-tax-assessment-map/), well I did it!

Props to Coreena Lewis of [Make Vancouver](https://www.makevancouver.com/) for laying out the t-shirt for me after I didn't get it right in the [Make Vancouver t-shirt design web app](https://www.makevancouver.com/products/american-apparel-adults-unisex-mighty-print-t-shirt). And for being super helpful. Thanks!

Fingers crossed it turns out well after printing!

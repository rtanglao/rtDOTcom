The greatest strength of languages like Scheme is that these two representations are much more closely aligned, which makes this kind of metaprogramming much easier—once you get over the hurdle of typing in parse trees. As noted yesterday, the overwhelming majority of programmers still prefer not to do this sixty years after Lisp syntax was invented and despite decades of use in education. I used to believe that programmers would one day switch from punchcard-compatible programming tools to ones that separated models from views, but I no longer expect to see that in my lifetime. It’s a shame—experiments like the Glamorous Toolkit make programming with lines of text look as antiquated as chiseling hieroglyphics onto stone tablets—but even with this self-imposed clumsiness, I still believe that beautiful is possible.`

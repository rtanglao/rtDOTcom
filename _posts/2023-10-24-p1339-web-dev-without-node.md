A quick introduction to test-driven web development using just the browser –&nbsp;Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2023/web-dev-without-node/) <-- The dream is gone but the baby is real or something :-) --> **QUOTE**: `This is absolutely possible with a buildless JS setup. ES modules, HTTP imports, and import maps work extremely well for the kind of mid-sized JavaScript projects required for many PHP or Ruby web services.  ... It’s even possible with many setups that do require bundling as tools like esbuild work both on their own, without wrappers, and with alternative runtimes that are simpler to manage, like deno. ... That still leaves us with a problem. Even if you’re skipping bundling or have that sorted with a simpler tool, you’re still left with a lot of tooling that’s implemented in node. An important one is the test-runner. ... But there’s a way out. ... Test in the browser with Mocha ... Sometimes you can have the best of both worlds: the simplicity of an HTML-based test-runner and continuous integration with coverage checks. ... `

* Read [Some Changes by Om](https://om.co/2019/08/27/some-changes/): "These days, it is popular to have a newsletter and a podcast — and I have those too — but for me, blogging is the future." <--- sums it all up quote!
* Seems like Om changed his mind since August 9 when he wrote [A Circle of Words: emails to blogs to newsletters](https://om.co/2019/08/09/a-circle-of-words-emails-to-blogs-to-newsletters/) :-) !
* Bravo, smart people can  change their minds.
* [Newsletters are silly unless you have something to sell in my opinion](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/07/p1-No-email-newsletter-and-other-accoutrements/) #ymmv of course! Again I don't read 99% of the newsletters I subscribe to but I do read 99% of the blogs whose RSS feed I subscribe to.

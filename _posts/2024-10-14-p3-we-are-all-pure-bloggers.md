* It's just that society brainwashes us to not create text, audio, video, whatever and share it with whomever we choose.
* [Om wrote in Pure Blogger](https://om.co/2024/10/13/pure-blogger/): `“Blogging is an individual and, I would say, selfish act — you do it  because it is what you want to do for you.” Pure blogging is “blogging”  because you have something to say. To me, that ability is what makes you a pure blogger. Any other explanation of blogging “is just the  traditional idea of media,” meant for an audience and reach.`

title: Prynt printable area is 2 inches by 3 inches not 620 pixels by 1120 pixels
---

## Pontifications
To close the loop: Contrary to what Prynt support told me [1] in November about [Prynt Zink 2x3 inches - Is printable area 620x1120 or something smaller?](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/21/p1-printable-area-prynt-zink-the-full-620x1120px/) **the Prynt printable area is 2 inches by 3 inches** (at least it is with the Samsung S5 Android Prynt App as of June 23, 2017)

    "The Prynt Case uses ZINK® (Zero Ink®) Printing Technology that produces photo-quality, full-color photos (313×339 DPI or 620×1120 px)" Can i print on the full 620x1120px or is the actual area that is printed smaller? If smaller what are the dimensions in pixels? Cheers! ...Roland<br /> <br />

## QUOTE
>The Nebo app (and general stylus) support on the
Boox Go 7 II (or Go Color 7 Gen II) is considered decent for casual note-taking and annotating, but it is not as precise or "paper-like" as Boox’s higher-end Note series. It uses USI 2.0 technology rather than Wacom EMR, which affects the writing feel and accuracy. 
Here is the breakdown of the stylus experience based on user reports and reviews:
>### Performance and Feel
>* Decent Responsiveness: The writing experience is generally responsive, but there is a slight, detectable lag between the pen tip and the screen, which can be frustrating for heavy users.
>* "Tappy" Writing Feel: The screen is glass, resulting in a slippery, "tappy" feeling without much resistance. Using a screen protector can improve this feel.
 >* Accuracy: Precision is not as high as on Wacom-based devices, which may lead to missed strokes or inaccuracies if writing very quickly or in small font.
 >* Best Use Case: It is best suited for quick notes, highlighting, and sketching rather than long-form, heavy writing session

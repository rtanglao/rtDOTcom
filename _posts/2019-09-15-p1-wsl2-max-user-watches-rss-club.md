* I learned about [RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/) :-) from [Ton](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/09/joining-rss-club-as-an-experiment/)
* I'll probably run into the [WSL2 max\_user\_watches problem](https://daverupert.com/2019/07/a-lament-for-max-user-watches/) in the future too (the blogger who blogged this is part of RSS club; I of course subscribed to the [RSS feed](https://daverupert.com/atom.xml))

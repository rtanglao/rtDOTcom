[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 4, 2022 15:02 [I Want a Memory Diagram Generator · The Third Bit](https://third-bit.com/2022/12/04/i-want-a-memory-diagram-generator/) <-- QUOTE: `I want a tool that will let me specify a program, its inputs, and a specific instant in its execution, and will then run the program to that instant, generate the memory diagram, and save it in a scalable file format like SVG. Specifying the point at which I want the diagram is the hard part: “stop at line 36” isn’t enough, since I might want to stop at that line on the fourth call or when the program is five levels deep in recursive calls.`<--- yes please i want this as well!

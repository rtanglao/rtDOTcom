[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 13, 2023 08:38  [Inside the Heart of ChatGPT’s Darkness](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/inside-the-heart-of-chatgpts-darkness) <--- Like self-driving it will be a bust this time but perhaps not the next AI summer aka AI summer 4.0 :-) Not looking forward to the GPT-3 winter aka AI winter 3.0 (or is it 4.0?!?)! --> QUOTE: `In hindsight, ChatGPT may come to be seen as the greatest publicity stunt in AI history, an intoxicating glimpse at a future that may actually take years to realize—kind of like a 2012-vintage driverless car demo, but this time with a foretaste of an ethical guardrail that will take years to perfect.`

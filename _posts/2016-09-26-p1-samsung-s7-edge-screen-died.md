title: The screen on my Samsung S7 Edge has died

## Pontifications
* This has never happened in 12 years of owning smartphones! I've used over 30. The Nokia N95 was indestructible! It worked even when the battery cover broke and I duct taped the battery into place and it worked in the rain even though it wasn't water proof or water resistant.
* I guess I'll try the putting it in rice for 24 hours thing.
* If that doesn't work, I'll see if I can get it fixed under warranty.
* I did try a [S7 hardware reset](http://wccftech.com/how-to-hard-reset-galaxy-s7-and-galaxy-s7-edge/) (which of course erased everything) and that didn't help! And I looked at this [S7 Edge troubleshooting guide](http://thedroidguy.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-troubleshooting).

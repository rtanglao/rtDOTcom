    An AMA is more or less exactly what it sounds like — an opportunity to ask someone anything that’s on your mind on a given topic. In Digital Ladders terms, it’s an opportunity for you to bring your specific questions, concerns, wonders, dilemmas, hopes, etc., to a digital expert.

    Each presenter will focus on a topic and will give a 5-10 minute overview including some basic information. After that, it’s up to those attending to ask questions to guide and drive the conversation. By engaging with individual questions, the presenter can really respond directly to what’s uniquely relevant to participants, in an informal and relaxed environment.

    Whether you’re facing a specific hurdle in the planning of a project, can’t get the hang of a certain elusive piece of software, or find yourself quickly needing new tools as you tackle a project solo or with a small team, you’ll get the answer you need to keep moving forward.

* [Lilia](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/)  is one of the smartest and most capable people I have met (we met in Vienna at Blogtalk 2.0 and in Seattle post 2004 but I didn't blog about it, imagine that?) . I know  that her research and work is more valid in 2019 than ever (e.g [Anjo Anjewierden / Rogier Brussee / Lilia Efimova: "Shared Conceptualizations in Weblogs"  - BlogTalk 2.0](http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/07/06/anjo-anjewierden-rogier-brussee-lilia-efimova-shared-conceptualizations-in-weblogs-blogtalk-2-0/)). We just have much more people doing social media!

* Lilia is [unschooling](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/tag/unschooling/) :-) her 3 children and when I met them last week you could see the fruits of her labour! Three lovely children. Oh and I guess her husband Robert helped too :-) 

* Looking forward to the next time!  We meet up ! Maybe in the Netherlands?!?

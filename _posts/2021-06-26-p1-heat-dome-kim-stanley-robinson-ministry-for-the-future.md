* Global News: [What you need to know about the ‘heat dome’ hovering above B.C., Alberta and territories](https://globalnews.ca/news/7983076/heat-wave-explained-bc-alberta/) <--- sounds just like heat wave in India in [KSR's Ministry for the Future](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/ministry-future) (and global warming was predicted by many many other science fiction writers like John Brunner in [The Sheep Look Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sheep_Look_Up))

  * QUOTE
  * `A heat dome is caused by a strong ridge of high pressure that traps warm air underneath it. Although not a term commonly used by Environment  Canada scientists, the heat dome gets its name because the ridge acts  like a dome, allowing the sun to crank up the heat below and create a  heat wave that lasts at least a few days.`

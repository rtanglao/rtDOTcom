[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Aug 24, 2025 14:34 (UTC)[ME:: Late to the party :-) -> All pieces of ATProto can and are running on non Bluesky servers e.g. Blacksky servers ; May 2, 2025:: Bryan Newbold:: A Full-Network Relay for $34 a Month](https://whtwnd.com/bnewbold.net/3lo7a2a4qxg2l) <-- **QUOTE**: `This is an update to a Summer 2024 blog post. At the time, atproto relays required a cache of the full network on local disk to validate data structures. With the Sync v1.1 updates, relays don't need all that disk I/O. What impact does that have on hosting setup and operating costs ... Turns out the dev community beat me to the punch and folks like @futur.blue and @bad-example have been doing this for months on Rapsberry Pis and $19/month VPS servers in European jurisdiction. ... But i'm still really psyched at how much simpler things have become, so I set up my own $34/month VPS demo instance, and this is the write-up. ...The relay describe here is running at: https://relay-vps.demo.bsky.dev` <-- See also Rudy Fraser's YouTube interview: [Blacksky Algorithms: Building Decentralized Social Media with Rudy Fraser](https://youtu.be/Uvj1h7OQPkk?si=OflEMDblOYTZOu1w) and of course [Blacksky.community](https://blacksky.community/) which is up and running and doing great AFAICT

They came up with the idea of bringing the Bay Area-based Super Happy Dev House to Vancouver.<br /><br />Bryght is providing the venue and BBQ space. Edit the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?super_happy_grow_op_dev_house#edit">wiki page</a> to let us know you&#39;re coming (also, <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/171753/">upcoming.org</a>).</p>   <p>Come one come all! There will be lots of hacking of all languages and environments and fun including Drupal hacking and making and improving some Drupal websites!</p>

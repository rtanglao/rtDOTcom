## QUOTE

>Flickr is one of the most popular photo hosting websites on the planet. Their extensive API gives programmers plenty of opportunity to use Flickr any way they see fit.

>The easy to use Flickr API has several interfaces written in Python, the best one created by Beej. I’ve been the maintainer for this interface since August 2007.

<p> <a href="http://www.computer-darkroom.com/lr_11/lr-11-review.htm">Ian Lyons&#39; Lightroom 1.1 Review</a> is the best Lightroom 1.1 review and summary of what&#39;s new I&#39;ve found so far. Complete with informative annotated screenshots! Thanks! </p><p> FROM <a href="http://www.computer-darkroom.com/lr_11/lr-11-review.htm">Adobe Lightroom</a>: </p><p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p><blockquote> So what&#39;s with the reference to a photo shoot to Antarctica? The photo shoot was memorable for many reasons, not least of which was the opportunity it provided to put Lightroom through its paces away from the comfort of home and our very speedy desktop computers. It allowed us to see how the application performed in the hands of those less familiar with its operation. It also provided an opportunity for those who had influenced much of what had gone into Lightroom 1.0 to hear what others really thought. Much was learned (good points and bad) and I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that many of the frustrations experienced by a much larger group of users since the official launch was also experienced by those on board the good ship Professor Multanovskiy. <br /> <br />Did much of what we learned find it&#39;s way back into Lightroom 1.1? Some of it did and some didn&#39;t, but then again Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day. Remember, Lightroom still hasn&#39;t celebrated its first birthday, so expectations of major enhancements are unrealistic, or are they? <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.computer-darkroom.com/lr_11/lr-11-review.htm">READ THE WHOLE THING FOR THE COMPLETE SCOOP!</a> </blockquote><p> <strong>END QUOTE</strong> </p>

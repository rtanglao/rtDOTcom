title: Zurfer zloooow on N93 over Canadian GPRS

I like <a href="http://zurfer.research.yahoo.com/">Zurfer</a> and it works great on my N93 over WiFi. Over GPRS however it times out in downtown Vancouver :-( I&#39;m guessing it works fine over EDGE which the N93 doesn&#39;t support. Anybody tried zurfer in Canada with EDGE?

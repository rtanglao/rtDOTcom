## Pontifications
* Happy to report that I received the Fido Google Security update June 2017 for the Pixel XL this week! Over the air!
* No need for ADB like the [Pixel security update combined with Fido/Rogers botched VOLTE update fiasco from March 2017](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/05/04/p1-1000s-fido-pixel-users-affected-by-fido-inserting-bad-VOLTE-update-into-google-update-process/)
* Hopefully we Pixel XL owners who use Fido and Rogers will now continue to get the monthly security updates as Google intended :-)

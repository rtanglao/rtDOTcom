## Pontifications

* [How does Ethereum work, anyway?](https://medium.com/@preethikasireddy/how-does-ethereum-work-anyway-22d1df506369) by [Preethi Kasireddy](https://twitter.com/iam_preethi) via [Boris](https://twitter.com/bmann/status/913771020015640577) looks to be a great primer.
* I will read this and see if I can learn from this :-)
* Wouldn't this be even greater if this was hosted on a non centralized infrastructure backed by the blockchain :-) ? 
* Would this be even greater if this was not on medium but on Preethi's domain as well as de-centralized infrastructure backed by the blockchain?

>And the only way to fix it is to take responsibility for everything you can do with computers.

>That’s what I started Garden Computing for.

>This sounds like an impossible task, but the good news is that the situation is so dire that there are very low-hanging fruits if you take a step back. And you only need to start in one place to see dramatic improvements.

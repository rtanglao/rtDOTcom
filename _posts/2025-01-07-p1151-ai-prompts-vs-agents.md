Since for now they are not AGI and unless there's a breakthrough AGI doesn't look like it will happen anytime soon (i.e. before 2030) but hey I could be wrong :-)

## QUOTE
Read the whole thing: [AI prompts vs. agents](https://www.manton.org/2025/01/07/ai-prompts-vs-agents.html) 

>This isn’t even the most insane story you could imagine. Many of the examples of AI threatening humanity are actually agents. AI that runs our military, power plants, or transportation with little human oversight.

>In generative AI, the “prompt” has a big influence on the quality of the output. Not just the prompt you see when typing into ChatGPT, but also the hidden prompts behind the scenes to guide the AI in the right direction.

>The prompt isn’t always something you type directly. It could be automatically triggered, for example to analyze keywords for a photo that was uploaded. But the prompt should be tied to a user action.
>The prompt puts humans in control. Ask a question, get an answer, review it, take action. Agents will attempt to collapse that workflow, in some cases replacing the human’s role in reviewing and taking action. This is dangerous.

>In my own use and work in Micro.one and Micro.blog, I plan to draw a line here. No agents. No unattended algorithms, as I wrote in my book. I hope this approach will help us use AI effectively without getting lost.

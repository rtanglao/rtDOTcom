title: "What's behind/underneath a web browser i.e. how does the internet work?"

## Pontifications

* Always wanted to do a wiki on how the internet works specficially how does the stuff underneath a web browser work? (I know the internet is more than web browsing but it's a start :-) !)
* Lots of explanations for geeks but nothing for normal folks that really explains WiFi, routers, anti-virus, firewall, software updates, DNS, SSL, etc etc

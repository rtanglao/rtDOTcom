<p>I want my "Newton Life" back. I want the ability to print and take notes and have it all tied automatically together on a device designed for casual on the go note taking. Much as I love laptops and agree with Danah Boyd's sentiments in <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/07/13/i_want_my_cybor.html">I want my cyborg life,</a> laptops are too disruptive in a way that taking notes with a pen or a Newton is not. Time is on my side. It's going to happen whether Apple does it or not. The hegemony of keyboards will fall and be replaced with an array of input methods including keyboards and printing and whatever makes sense in the context of where one is now. And the "tyranny" of the file system and 40 year old Unix technology (much as I love them too) will go the way of the dodo eventually as well.</p>

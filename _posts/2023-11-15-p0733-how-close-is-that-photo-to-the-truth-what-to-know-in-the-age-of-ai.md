What to Know in the Age of AI - CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/features/how-close-is-that-photo-to-the-truth-what-to-know-in-the-age-of-ai/) <-- each pixel is R, G, or B but pixel values are R AND G AND B so it makes up the other 2! I always forget this! --> **QUOTE**: `The very first moment of capture occurs when photons of light reach a digital image sensor, the special-purpose chip tasked with converting that light into pixel data. Each pixel can capture either red, green or blue, but when you see a photo, each pixel must have components of all three colors. That means cameras construct the rest with "demosaicking" algorithms that make their best guess at the missing color data — for example the red and blue information in a pixel that only captured green light...."Two thirds of the pixels are completely made up — generated by your device, not recorded," said Hany Farid, a University of California, Berkeley professor who has studied photo authenticity for decades and who once helped launch an image authenticity startup.`

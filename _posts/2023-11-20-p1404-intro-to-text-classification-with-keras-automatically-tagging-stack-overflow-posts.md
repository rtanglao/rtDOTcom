[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 20, 2023 14:04 [Intro to text classification with Keras: automatically tagging Stack Overflow posts ¦ Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/intro-to-text-classification-with-keras-automatically-tagging-stack-overflow-posts) <-- From October 2017. 6 years later we can do this better? --> **QUOTE**: `As humans, our brains can easily read a piece of text and extract the topic, tone, and sentiment. Up until just a few years ago, teaching a computer to do the same thing required extensive machine learning expertise and access to powerful computing resources. Now, frameworks like TensorFlow are helping to simplify the process of building machine learning models, and making it more accessible to developers with no background in ML. ... In this post, we’ll show you how to build a simple model to predict the tag of a Stack Overflow question. We’ll solve this text classification problem using Keras, a high-level API built in to TensorFlow.`

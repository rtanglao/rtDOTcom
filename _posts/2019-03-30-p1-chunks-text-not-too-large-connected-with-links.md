*  [Boris Mann](https://twitter.com/bmann/status/1112090591779680257):

<blockquote>

"blogging ;) I’ll be at 20 years next year!

So, more broadly, a domain I own and HTML. Also Git. How to generate and host it changes.

Chunks of text, not too large, connected with links. 

Bullish on IPFS. Spec that rely on URIs will need to be re-imagined. That’s exciting!"

* I started blogging in late 1999 methinks so it's my 20th year! Go Boris-20-years go!

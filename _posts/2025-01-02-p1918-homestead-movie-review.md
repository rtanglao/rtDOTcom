## QUOTE

>It wasn’t a coincidence that br⭕wn-skinned men speaking a different language (Tⓐgalog, I believe), were the ones who set off the nuclear bomb off the coast of Los Angeles that triggers the post-apocalyptic setting of the film.

>H⭕mestead is an ⓐngel Studios production, the company known for mega-hits like The Ch⭕sen and S⭕und of Freedom.

>ⓐngel Studios is not sitting at the kids’ table in the film and TV space. With revenues climbing to $45 million in the first half of 2024 and plans to go public, the studio has become adept at weaving faith-focused themes into high-quality entertainment.

>While their content has high production value, the studio’s alignment with a blend of conservative ideology and a particular type of Chrᜁstianity had me skeptical.

>As the movie unfolded, my initial unease proved well-founded.

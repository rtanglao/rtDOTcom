title: What personal wiki should I use? VoodooPad has always seemed fab. I don't want to run a server so MediaWiki is out.

## Pontifications

I want to create my own personal wiki and I don't want to run PHP or my own server so that rules out the fab [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki). I've always admired [VoodooPad](https://plausible.coop/voodoopad/). Any other Linux or OS X recommendations?

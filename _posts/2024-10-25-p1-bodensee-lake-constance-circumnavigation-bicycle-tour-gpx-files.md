* Bodensee Bummel Day 1 route: Bodensee Bummel: Hotel Ko'ono, Konstanz -> Gailingen am Hochrein ([Day 1 GPX file in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4YJmoGz6i6LVxq7FSUYpo0yD_gQx3L3/view?usp=sharing)) <-- [www.strava.com/routes/3282752547101555878 ](https://www.strava.com/routes/3282752547101555878) Please don't follow this route :-) because we ended up on the road too much because we didn't have a GPX file in advance like this. Instead, use it to plan yours :-) And hopefully someday somebody will do a proper route that avoids traffic as much as possible (I bet somebody else has already done so and I hope Radweg Reisen provides the GPX files to future customers which I see other bicycle tour companies e.g. UTracks provides a  [Digital information pack with route notes & GPX for their Spanish Camino bicycle tour](https://www.utracks.com/Spain/Self-Guided-Cycling/Spanish-Camino-by-Bike-Leon-to-Santiago) ).

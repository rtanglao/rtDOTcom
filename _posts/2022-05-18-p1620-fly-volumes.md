Their announcement included this snippet:"The lede is “free Postgres” because that’s what matters to full stack apps. You don’t have to use these for Postgres. If SQLite is more your jam, mount up to 3GB of volumes and use “free SQLite.” Yeah, we’re probably underselling that"` <--- 3GB of free storage for SQLite or Postgres that can be used rea write as well as read only!

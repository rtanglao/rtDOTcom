[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Sep 29, 2020.[I was wrong. CRDTs are the future](https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-are-the-future/) <--- let's ditch OT . operational transfer, and replace with and the re-impliment Google Wave for the 21st century using conflict free replicated data types:-) ?!?!? <--- juicy quote:

"
So Operational Transform, I think this is goodbye from me. We had some great times. Some of the most challenging, fun code I’ve ever written was operational transform code. OT - you’re clever and fascinating, but CRDTs can do things you were never capable of. And CRDTs need me. With some good implementations, I think we can make something really special.

I mourn all the work I’ve done on OT over the years. But OT is no longer fits into the vision I have for the future. CRDTs would let us remake Wave, but simpler and better. And they would let us write software that treats users as digital citizens, not a digital serfs. And that matters.

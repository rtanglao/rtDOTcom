* I believe that just like learning styles we don't have one, it's contextual. We might have one we prefer or default to but doesn't mean we can't be all.
* Read Jory McKay's [These are 4 styles of communication that you need to know](https://www.fastcompany.com/90296536/these-are-4-styles-of-communication-that-you-need-to-know) to learn more about:
* Analytic folks: provide details upfront with clear expectations
* Intuitive folks: Keep it high level  on the main topic, answer follow ups, minimize details
* Functional: Active Listening i.e. repeat what  they've said, expect details and lists
* Personal: Keep it light and casual, don't get offended by personal or discussions about feelings, follow-up with details and more info

title: "Awesome idea from Kip - Fill Hilbert Curve square with average colour from instagram photos from 365 days or flickr photos and random spanning trees"

## Pontifications

* From department of things Kip told me that I don't understand yet :-) but I am sure I will understand in < 10 years:
* Awesome idea from Kip - Fill a [Hilbert Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) square with average colour from instagram photos from 365 days or flickr photos" - "Technically it's a pseudo Hilbert Curve"
* And there's some Python and C code for this in: [allRGB: Hilbert curves and random spanning trees](https://possiblywrong.wordpress.com/2014/04/18/allrgb-hilbert-curves-and-random-spanning-trees/)

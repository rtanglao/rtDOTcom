If this is well documented, new contributors can get started with a minimal amount of help from existing maintainers, which can save you a lot of time in the long run and reduce frustration for maintainers who are answering the same questions over and over. At a minimum, you should have instructions for everything that is required to get your project up and running in a development environment along with the process and guidelines for submitting a new contribution.`

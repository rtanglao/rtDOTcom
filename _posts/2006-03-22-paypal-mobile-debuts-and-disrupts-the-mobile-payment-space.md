<p>I second that wow! Talk about &quot;turning over the napkin&quot; :-) of mobile payment. I'll have to try this, but it sounds very cool and amazingly enough it sounds like it works in Canada from the get go!</p> <p>From <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2006/03/23/paypal-mobile-debuts/">Paypal Mobile Debuts -- Alec Saunders .LOG</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Wow.  I just picked up the news about PayPal mobile from Russell Beattie and MobileCrunch.  Now you can use SMS to make any kind of payment to anyone who has a phone.  You simply text 729725 with &quot;SEND x to yyyyyyyyyy&quot; where x is the amount, and yyyyyyyyyy is the recipients phone number.  A couple of seconds later your mobile rings, you enter your pin number, and press 1 to authorize the transaction, and you're done. Easy-peasy!</p>  </blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

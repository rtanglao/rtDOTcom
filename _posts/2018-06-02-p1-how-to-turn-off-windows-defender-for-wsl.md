**QUOTE**

<blockquote>
So, to do so, first get the UbuntuOnLinux (or your distro of choice) installation path going to <i>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages</i> and lookup for something like :<br ><b>CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc.</b><br /><br />

Copy the entire path from Explorer.exe address bar, then go to <br /><i>Settings > Update & Security > Windows Defender > Open Windows Defender Security Central > Protection Against Viruses & Threats > Advanced Configâ€¦ > Exclusions > Add or Remove > Add > Folder</i> and finally: paste the previous copied path

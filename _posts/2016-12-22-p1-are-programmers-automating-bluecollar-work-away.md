title: Mike Hoye --  Are programmers automating blue collar work away?
---

## Pontifications

Yes and they are also automating their own jobs away. 

When will programmers lose their jobs due to automation?

After blue collar folks do (and after we have [real software security and layering and components](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/12/17/p1-software-is-hard-no-clean-separation-or-componentization/)). [I think there's a lot in common between the 2 groups, Mike's opinion is different :-)](https://twitter.com/mhoye/status/811997064745938944). I suggest [Mike write a blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/) :-) !

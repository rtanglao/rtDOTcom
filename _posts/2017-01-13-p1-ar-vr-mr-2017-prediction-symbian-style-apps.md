title: Augmented reality, virtual reality and  mixed reality 2017 predictions - no killer apps like instagram, snapchat or Facebook, just Symbian-era-like unpolished experiences

## Pontifications

* Crazy claim: you have to go through a Newton / Symbian-like era before you get an iPhone-like polished-usable-by-human experience
* And that's what will happen with AR, VR and MR in 2017: nothing polished, some superb stuff but in the same way ShoZu was superb before Flickr and instagram  and in the same way qik was awesome before Facebook live and twitch.tv: only appeals to a few early adopters who don't mind the jank and the rough edges
* 2018 will be great though: I figure SnapChat will do something cool in AR/MR/VR though but I definitely do want those SnapChat $USD130 glasses in 2017 :-) !!!!!!

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 21, 2024 23:18 [Men and Women Perform - by Timothy Snyder](https://snyder.substack.com/p/men-and-women-perform?publication_id=310897&post_id=151882919&isFreemail=true&r=w33x&triedRedirect=true) --> "Christian Reconstrunctionism" hmmm --> **QUOTE**: `In the Republic of Gilead's dystopian future, men and women perform the services assigned to them. ....When I read those sixteen words, meant as a description of a novel, I felt as though a barrier were being thrown up between the possible reader and a text we very much need.  Christian Reconstructionism is now at the edge of power in the United States, and the attitude of the relevant people towards the female body and indeed towards rape is an essential element of what is happening and what is likely to happen.  Both-sidesism, prudery, and euphemisms are keeping much of the media from bringing this story together in time.  We will need clear language in general, and this novel in particular, to see the whole picture.  I will develop this in two posts to come.`

 >The hallmarks of AI generation are all here: ... Confident assertions without factual backing ... Meandering diversions that maintain loose semantic connection to the topic ... Pattern-matching to previous responses (“ripped off,” “billions of dollars”) ....Optimization for what sounds good rather than what’s true

>Just as an LLM will confidently generate plausible-sounding text without any real understanding, The Convicted Criminal generates responses that sound like answers while avoiding any engagement with the actual substance of the questions.

>He doesn’t answer the actual questions. He doesn’t address the actual points. He doesn’t understand what’s actually going on, so he crafts a rambling nonsensical answer based loosely on the question, while following the system prompt’s instructions to make sure the answer makes himself look good.

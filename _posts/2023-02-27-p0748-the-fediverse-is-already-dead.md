I agree, let's do it! Read the whole thing! --> QUOTE: `Ultimately, I’m still an idealist. I don’t think proprietary, centralized solutions - even cozy bug themed ones - are the answer to social media. I think that medium-sized co-op communities are as good as it gets for now, until we get easy to use, resiliant, secure peer to peer social media. I believe that progress can be made on racism and on stability in the Social Archipelago....I believe in communities, and I believe in us. Let’s do it!`

I had over 80 categories on <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/2004/02/29.html">my old Radio Blog</a>.  I think that was too many.

All non tech stuff will go on our personal blog at <a href="http://www.barbandroland.com/">www.BarbAndRoland.com</a>.  So that leaves about 60 categories.

I think I will see how it develops, but for now, I think the categories will be: Social  Software (for wikis, blogs, RSS, etc.), HowToDevelopSoftware and the rest I will leave uncategorized for now.

Suggestions? Leave a comment or email roland AT rolandtanglao.com

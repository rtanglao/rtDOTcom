## Pontifications

* Read [The insane amount of backward compatibility in Google Maps](https://www.tnhh.net/posts/google-maps-insane-backward-compatibility.html) by Huan Truong. 
* Google Maps backwards compatibility via [Dave](http://scripting.com/2018/02/10.html#a142901) - at what point does this become an albatross? How do you even keep things working? I doubt Google tests it on all these old phones and OSes!??!

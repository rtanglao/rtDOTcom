[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 11, 2024 07:52 [missing the point of webassembly — wingolog](https://wingolog.org/archives/2024/01/08/missing-the-point-of-webassembly) <-- QUOTING from a comment: `“I have a different preferred starting point which is less descriptive but more operational: WebAssembly is a new fundamental abstraction boundary. WebAssembly is a new way of dividing computing systems into pieces and of composing systems from parts.”` and another QUOTE: `I was thinking today, you know, it actually makes sense to run a WebAssembly operating system, one which runs WebAssembly binaries.` <-- yes please to everything running everywhere in a standard environment just like JSON is data everywhere! --> See also: public object: [WebAssembly is like JSON for behaviour](https://publicobject.com/2024/01/11/wasm/)

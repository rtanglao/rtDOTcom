title: "Stats 101 :-) ! Density functions use the plot variable count/(sum of all variable count)"

## Pontifications
Thanks to Kamyar I re-learned :-) the following today:

* e.g. if you have 200 lines with 1 variable say ```colourvalue``` as an integer :-)
    * Then density ```y``` value for a particular integer ```colourvalue``` = #of times that particular integer ```colourvalue``` occurs/sum of i.e. sigma(all ```colourvalues``` occurrences)

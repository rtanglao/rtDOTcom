    Unless we are deliberately forgetting the invention of 
    the shipwreck in the invention of the ship or the rail 
    accident in the advent of the train, we need to examine 
    the hidden face of new technologies, before that face 
    reveals itself in spite of us.
    ```

    Few things reveal the extent of our reliance on a particular 
    technology quite like having that piece of technology suddenly 
    and unexpectedly stop working. And though our days are 
    punctuated by small and mildly annoying malfunctions, 
    there is always the risk of more serious technological 
    breakdowns, the sort that can truly turn our world upside 
    down: the plane that crashes, the ship that gets stuck in 
    the canal, the web platform outage that leaves us unsure 
    how to communicate with the people we care about, or 
    the power plant that melts down.

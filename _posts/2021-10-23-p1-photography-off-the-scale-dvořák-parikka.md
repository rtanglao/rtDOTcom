```
"These essays address the epistemological, aesthetic and 
political implications of various forms of scaling in both 
scholarly and artistic work. From the mass image in 
vernacular culture to transformations of photography in 
contexts of big data and artificial intelligence, they 
explore the massification of photography. They propose a 
shift into a fundamental re-evaluation of our theoretical 
coordinates so as to understand the underpinning media 
and culture of this change."

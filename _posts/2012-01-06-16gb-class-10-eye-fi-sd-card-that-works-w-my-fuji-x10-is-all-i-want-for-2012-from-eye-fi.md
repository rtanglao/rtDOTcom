<p>that's all I want in 2012 from eye.fi :-) ! Seems a bit ridiculous :-) for the top of the line <a href="http://www.eye.fi/products/prox2">Pro X2 eye.fi card</a>&nbsp; to be stuck at Class 6, 8 GB. I and presumably lots of others need faster cards with more storage! I need a card that works with my Fuji X10. Apparently the <a href="http://support.eye.fi/cameras/fujifilm/x10">Pro X2 doesn't work with my X10</a>!</p>

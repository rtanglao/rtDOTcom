title: It looks like 100s (or is it 1000s?!?) of Fido subscribers with Pixels were stuck at an insecure Feb 2017 Android security update because Fido messed up when they tried and failed to add a VOLTE update to the Pixel March 2017 update

## Pontifications
* [It looks like 100s (or is it 1000s?!?) of Fido subscribers with Pixels were stuck at an insecure Feb 2017 Android security update because Fido messed up when they tried and failed to add a VOLTE update to the Pixel March 2017 update](http://forums.fido.ca/t5/forums/forumtopicpage/board-id/Smartphones/message-id/32968/highlight/false#M32968).
* Assuming you have a modicum of tech savviness :-) [follow the procedure in my previous blog post to get unstuck from Feb 2017 and get to April 2017](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/05/02/p1-fixed-fido-pixel-xl-stuck-feb2017-bug-by-manually-flashing-april2017/). Fido should in my opinion do this for less tech savvy folks for free since they are the ones that messed up and broke the Pixel monthly update cycle!

Highly Recommended!</p><p>From <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/12/09/when-open-source-is-like-bad-sex/">When Open Source is Like Bad S*x</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>In their relationship with developers, users can meet them half way by understanding that sh*t happens. They can help with testing, by reporting the bugs, and by maintaining a sense of humor when things don't\t quite go right. And yes, being grateful for the software, especially when it's 'free'. However, the developers also have a responsibility back to the user: to fix bugs, as soon as possible; to let users know about potential problems; and above all, to be respectful of the application's users and their concerns.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

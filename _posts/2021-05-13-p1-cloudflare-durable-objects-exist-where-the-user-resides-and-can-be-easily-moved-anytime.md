title: "Stratechery: Cloudflare Durable Objects exist on the edge where the user resides and can be easily moved anywhere"

* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) May 12, 2021. [Cloudflare on the edge](https://stratechery.com/2021/cloudflare-on-the-edge/) <--- Durable objects exist in the user's country and nowhere else i.e. A German user's data resides in Germany "Durable Objects are not, in-and-of-themselves, going to kill the public clouds; what they represent, though, is an entirely new way of building infrastructure â€” from the edge in, as opposed to the data center out "
* Zones, we don't need no stinkin' zones or something :-)
* Data should reside where it should reside and other tautologies :-)
* Decentralized, movable data for the win!

title: Python 2.7 versus 3 in 2017 - seems like version 3 is the winner
---

## Pontifications
* [Python 2.7 won't be supported after roughly April 12, 2020 which is years away](https://pythonclock.org/) (less than 3!)
* [Python 2 vs Python 3: Practical Considerations](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-2-vs-python-3-practical-considerations-2)  seems to be a nice summary

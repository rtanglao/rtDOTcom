## Pontifications
 
* Google Play Store and iOS App Store Review reply limits of 350 and 5970 are not documented anywhere official by Google and Apple?!?
* From [How to reply to iOS App Store Reviews (with Screenshots)](https://blog.reviewbot.io/how-to-reply-to-ios-app-store-reviews-with-screenshots-48b65b8d2994)  
* And I see mentions of 350 for Google Play (which I know from personal experience) and 5000 for iOS App Stores on [AppFollow 3.3: January Edition](https://blog.appfollow.io/appfollow-33-popular-reviews-mac-app-store-iphone-x-e891171683f7) .

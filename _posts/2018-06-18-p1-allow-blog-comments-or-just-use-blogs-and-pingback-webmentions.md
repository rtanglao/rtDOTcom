## Pontifications
* Ton raises some great points in his blog post:
	* [Entropy as Power Difference, or Why Itâ€™s Always Easier to F Things Up](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2018/06/entropy-as-power-difference-or-why-its-always-easier-to-f-things-up/)
* Allow blog comments or just use ping back, trackback and Web Mentions?
* Since I started blogging in 1999, I've always disliked blog comments and hosting them but haven't really thought too much  about it.
* My current position: I think the best thing is to use something like ping back, trackback or Web Mentions and blog your comment in response to a blog.
* I agree that centralized comments always fail in time because of sp*m. And what Ton said about power and entropy :-)
* Someday :-), I will implement something like Web Mentions !

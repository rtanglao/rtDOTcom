>What else could Canada have done? Grant’s answer was to embrace radical left-wing populism. Only a populist government with the guts to cut its tie to the Americans and launch a frankly socialist nationalization of the economy, he argued, could have preserved Canada’s sovereignty. Only then could Canada have remained master in its own house. His paradoxical belief in a socialist state made Grant, a religious conservative who was profoundly opposed to abortion, an unlikely darling of the Canadian left.

>Grant’s politics may no longer make sense, but his diagnosis of our dilemmas remains as acute as ever. The French and British sources of our distinctive identity remain our lynchpin, but they remain in permanent tension even to this day.

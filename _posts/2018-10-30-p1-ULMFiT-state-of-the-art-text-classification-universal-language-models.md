title: "Maybe we can use UMLFiT for machine learning on SUMO support questions and support tweets?"

## Pontifications

* Via Felix, I learned about Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification (ULMFiT) which might be what we need to do machine learning on SUMO Firefox Desktop support
questions and tweets.
* From Jermey Howard and Sebastian Ruder's May 15, 2018 blog post, [Introducing state of the art text classification with universal language models](http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducting-ulmfit.html)

<blockquote>

This post is a lay-person’s introduction to our new paper, which shows how to classify documents automatically with both higher accuracy and less data requirements than previous approaches. We’ll explain in simple terms: natural language processing; text classification; transfer learning; language modeling; and how our approach brings these ideas together. If you’re already familar with NLP and deep learning, you’ll probably want to jump over to our NLP classification page for technical links.

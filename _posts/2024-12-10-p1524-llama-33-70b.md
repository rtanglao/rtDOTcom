Just 20 months ago I was amazed to see something that felt GPT-3 class run on that same machine. The quality of models that are accessible on consumer hardware has improved dramatically in the past two years. ... My laptop is a 64GB MacBook Pro M2, which I got in January 2023—two months after the initial release of ChatGPT. All of my experiments running LLMs on a laptop have used this same machine.`

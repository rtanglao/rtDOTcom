<p>I'll be speaking with <a href="http://www.blogaholics.ca/archives/2005/03/preparing_for_i.html">Arieanna</a> and <a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/">Tris</a> about <a href="http://iimaonline.org/events.html">Blogging for Dollars</a> at the <a href="http://iimaonline.org/">IIMA</a>. It starts at 5p.m. and goes to 8p.m. (I hope there's sandwiches or some kind of food!) at UBC Robson where Northern Voice was and costs $35 for members and $50 for non members.  The three of us will speak followed by a panel discussion moderated by Tris.  Apparently 40 companies have signed up already. Fun! If you have something that you would like me to speak about, leave a comment and I'll try to get to it! See you there!

* Had to Reboot my Surface Book 2 again to get WiFi working, [just like April 12, 2018](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/12/p1-had-to-reboot-to-get-wifi-working-on-surface-book2/)
* I need to try the  ```ipconfig /release``` and then ```ipconfig /renew``` powershell dance next time like I did back in 2018!

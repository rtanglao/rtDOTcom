## Pontifications

* Roland's podcast pontification posit: Any podcast over 5 minutes is probably too long :-) Including [Over 40 in Vancouver](https://audioboom.com/over40invan), the podcast that comes out weekly and that I collaborate on with the fab [Dale](http://www.group42.ca/).
* Do you listen to podcasts? Do you think they could be shorter? I bet you do. I bet you listen at 1.5x or even faster.
* Get to the point people :-) and/or edit or just have a hard 5 or 10 minute limit.

<p>Sorry, I won't use any tag cloud including ZoomClouds that doesn't link to my tags on my own site i.e. ZoomClouds should link to rolandtanglao.com/tag/tagname not zoomclouds.com/tag/roland-tanglao/tagname unless ZoomClouds pays me for the links :P </p> <p>Time for me to install the drupal tagcloud module! Eines Tages/Some day! </p> <p>From <a href="http://www.zoomclouds.com/">ZoomClouds</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Tag clouds are cool, informative, appealing representations abot what's happening in your blog, or anywhere else. </p> <p>With ZoomClouds you can put in a matter of minutes a tag cloud in your site, based on whichever RSS feed you like.</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

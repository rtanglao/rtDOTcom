[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jun 18, 2023 19:20   [64 Types of Dark Pink - Simplicable](https://simplicable.com/colors/dark-pink) - not all of these are "really pink" :-) whatever that means - use `some_string.unpack('U*')` to get an array of bytes or better yet `File.open('test.bin', 'wb') {¦file¦ BinData::Uint32be.new(3
344989183).write(file) }` which is the same as `File.open('test.bin', 'wb') {¦file¦ BinData::Uint32be.new(0xc7607bff).write(file) }`

## Pontifications

* Wavelengh the micro.blog podcasting app doesn't support stereo recording through the lightning port unlike [Voice Record Pro which I blogged about yesterday](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/01/p1-voice-record-pro-records-stereo-through-ios-lightning-port/)
Pity it would have been great to have an all-in-one solution that can record 2 microphones, 1 left, 1 right, like AudioBoom!

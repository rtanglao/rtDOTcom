## Pontifications

* Even better news than yesterday's [Zendesk has a Google Play Store Review Reply Integration](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/01/p1-zendesk-has-a-google-play-review-reply-integration/), there is a [Google Play Developer Reply to Reviews API](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/reply-to-reviews)! 
* Yes! I'd love to write my own reply tool (or more likely get somebody to write one for me :-) )

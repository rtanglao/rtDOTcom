title: How we record over 40 in Vancouver
---

tl;dr: 2 XLR Mics -> Roland Duo Capture EX battery powered USB interface -> USB to Lightning Cable -> iPhone -> [Audioboom](https://audioboom.com/) iOS App

## Pontifications

Here's how we (me and the fab [Dale](https://twitter.com/dale42)!) as of this writing record [over 40 in Vancouver](https://audioboom.com/over40invan), our 10 minute weekly podcast about living and being old-ish :-) in Vancouver:

* 2 [Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic USB/XLR mics](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/b8dd84773f83092c/) are plugged using XLR cables into a 
* [Roland Duo Capture EX USB Interface](http://www.roland.ca/products/duo-capture_ex/) that is battery powered with 3 AA batteries and we monitor using [Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones](https://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-MDR7506/).
* The USB Interface is plugged into an USB to Lightning cable which is plugged into
* an iPhone 7 Plus running the [Audioboom iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/audioboo/id305204540?mt=8) (there's an Android app too)
* We record using the Audioboom iOS App and upload directly to Audioboom's servers. No muss no fuss, no editing! Our 10 minute podcast is usually live in less than 1 hour (usually less than 45 minutes!) from ordering our coffee to recording to being available for your listening pleasure on the internet!
* Future possible enhancements:
    * I'd love to use 2 bluetooth mics or some other wireless mics and get rid of the USB interface
    * I'd love to record into a simple iOS podcast recording and light editing app (not Garageband) and do some minor audio editing before uploading to Audioboom!

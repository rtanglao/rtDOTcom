[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 27, 2023 18:23 [Embeddings: What they are and why they matter](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/) <-- All that we see is but a dream within an array of 1536 dimensional vectors LOL -> **QUOTE**:`I currently have 472 articles on my site. I calculated the 1,536 dimensional embedding vector (array of floating point numbers) for each of those articles, and stored those vectors in my siteâ€™s SQLite database....Now, if I want to find related articles for a given article, I can calculate the cosine similarity between the embedding vector for that article and every other article in the database, then return the 10 closest matches by distance.`

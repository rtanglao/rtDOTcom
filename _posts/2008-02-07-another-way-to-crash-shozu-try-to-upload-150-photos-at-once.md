title: Another way to crash ShoZu - try to upload 150 photos at once

Here's what I did:

<ol>
  <li>Set Nokia's camera app on my N95 to take a photo every 10 seconds</li>

  <li>Took over 200 photos on my bike ride in today</li>

  <li>Deleted about 50</li>

  <li>Selected the remaining 150 and tried to upload them with ShoZu to flickr</li>
</ol><br />
<p>Here's what happened:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phone started repeatedly complaining about low memory</li>

  <li>ShoZu "crashes" every time (by crash I mean doesn't display the ShoZu main screen and just sits there, rest of phone is functional)</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's the software that was installed on my N95 (all installed on my main memory):</p>
<ol>
  <li>A funky theme I got from SiMo</li>

  <li>YBrowser</li>

  <li>ShoZu</li>

  <li>Bambuser</li>

  <li>Flixwagon</li>

  <li>Qik</li>

  <li>Google Maps</li>
</ol>
<p>I guess uploading 150 photos at a time is not a normal :-) use case for ShoZu. Or maybe it's a bug. Or maybe I have too many apps installed. Looks like I'll have to hard reset my N95 and start over again, aaargh (how many times have I done this? about a dozen! oh the joys of early adoption)!!!</p><br />

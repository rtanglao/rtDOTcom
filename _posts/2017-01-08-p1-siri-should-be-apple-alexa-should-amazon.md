title: Microcopy matters -- Siri should be Apple and Alexa should be Amazon
---

tl;dr **Apple please rename "Siri" to "Apple" and Amazon please rename "Alexa" to "Amazon**"!

## Pontifications

* I learned a new word today "microcopy" - ["The small bits of text/copy that help instruct and alleviate the concerns of your users."](http://unmatchedstyle.com/news/microcopy-why-is-it-so-important.php)
* The microcopy reference was in [Niamh Redmond's tweet](https://twitter.com/nredmond/status/818220288001220608): “I’ve learned throughout my career that the most significant UX performance gains often come down to microcopy."
* The following quote is from a fabulous article by [Johna Paolino](https://twitter.com/johnapao) ["Google Home vs Alexa
Two Simple User Experience Design Gestures that Delighted a Female User"](https://medium.com/startup-grind/google-home-vs-alexa-56e26f69ac77#.hedup4svd):

**QUOTE** 

<blockquote>
"<br />
Alexa responds to her name only. Google’s product must be triggered with a “hey Google” or “ok Google”. By requiring these introductory words as triggers, Google has forced an element of conversation. The experience difference here is huge! When I return to Alexa now I feel authoritative.<br />
"
</blockquote>

**END QUOTE**

* From that article I reach my thrilling conclusion: **why should robots or assistants be gendered? In fact they shouldn't! So Apple please rename "Siri" to "Apple" and Amazon please rename "Alexa" to "Amazon**"!

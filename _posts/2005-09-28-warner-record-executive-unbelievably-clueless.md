<p>Wow! Good luck Michael. Now that the iTunes genie is out of the bag, good luck putting it back in. I suspect it will be Steve Jobs and not any cr*zy Warner exec who will have the last laugh on this one. One more reason that I will not buy from any major record label (direct from the artist that is all!) OR the iTunes store. Both sides fiddle while the iTunes generation burns and the band plays on.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/27/warner_apple_decapitation/">Warner raises decapitation strategy for Apple | The Register</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>CTIA Michael Nash, Warner's digital strategy chief, suggested labels might have no choice other than cut Apple's digital music sales off at a stroke.
</p>
<p>"What if Jobs says 39 cents or 29 cents per download - what then? The industry can say, OK we'll cut him of - very few people people buy music from digital downloads," said Nash, who pointed out that most of the music on iPods is from their own collections.</p>

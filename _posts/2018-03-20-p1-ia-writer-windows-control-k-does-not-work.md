title: "IA Writer for Windows: Control K for links doesn't work"
---

## Pontifications
 
* IA Writer for Windows: Control K for links doesn't work. Steps to reproduce: copy something to the clipboard with Control C. Highlight some text. Control K. Highlighted text gets deleted and replaced with link text
* Major bug :-)
* Luckily doesn't seem to be something that is hard to fix.
* If this bug ever gets fixed, IA Writer for Windows will be just as good as [IA Writer Mac](http://rolandtanglao.com/2015/10/14/p2-love-ia-writer/)

" - Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/109566492698655710) --> ROFL, mhoye's take is based on [The End of Programming by Matt Welsh](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/1/267976-the-end-of-programming/fulltext) which has this juicy QUOTE: `In this new computer science—if we even call it computer science at all—the machines will be so powerful and already know how to do so many things that the field will look like less of an engineering endeavor and more of an an educational one; that is, how to best educate the machine, not unlike the science of how to best educate children in school. Unlike (human) children, though, these AI systems will be flying our airplanes, running our power grids, and possibly even governing entire countries. I would argue that the vast majority of Classical CS becomes irrelevant when our focus turns to teaching intelligent machines rather than directly programming them. Programming, in the conventional sense, will in fact be dead.`

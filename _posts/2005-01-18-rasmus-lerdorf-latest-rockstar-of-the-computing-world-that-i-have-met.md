<p>I met <a href="http://lerdorf.com/bio.php">Rasmus Lerdorf</a>, creator of PHP, last Friday and discovered he took Systems Design Engineering at Waterloo just like I did (he's class of 1993, I am class of 1988).  Very cool.

<p>So now, I have met the following rockstars: <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/04/28/douglas-engelbart-bcnet-2004-keynote-sfu-harbour-centre">Douglas Engelbart</a>, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/11/20/tonights_dinner_with_dave_winer">Dave Winer</a>, and Rasmus. Still to go: Linus Torvalds and the MySQL people.</p>

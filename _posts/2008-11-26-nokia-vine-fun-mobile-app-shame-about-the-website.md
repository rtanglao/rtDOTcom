Just tried <a href="http://www.nseries.com/nseries/vine/">viNes</a> on the E71 (check out my my <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=540471">Y! Purple Bike 1st ride route</a>). The mobile app part of viNes is much nicer than Nokia Sports Tracker (this could be a &quot;honeymoon effect&quot; due to the E71's expanded RAM and fast processor but viNes on an E71 is much better than Sports Tracker on an N95-1! Sadly viNes doesn't work on an N95-1). In a bit of an oddity, the maps show on both the Nokia Sports Tracker site as well as the viNes site. The website (like far too many Nokia websites, what is the problem Nokia? Adopt Joomla, WordPress, Drupal or Rails, stop using proprietary web systems with ridiculous amount of flash please!) is still very bad: not enough social media features (that you get for free on the aforementioned platforms), too much gratuitous flash and bad URLs (check out <a href="/tags/nokia-sports-tracker">my past whingeing :-) about the Sports Tracker site</a>!). Someday when the iPhone has background processing, an app like this will come to that mobile too! Until then, viNes is much better than any of the iPhone GPS tracker apps I have tried.

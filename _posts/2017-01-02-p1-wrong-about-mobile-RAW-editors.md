title: 2016 Prediction -- wrong about mobile RAW editors
---

## Pontifications

* [I was wrong about mobile RAW editors.](http://21stcenturycam.com/prediction-by-31dec2016-there-will-be-an-awesome-ipad-pro-raw-editor) No standalone RAW editors on iOS (lightroom on iOS is close but no cigar since it has sync and AFAIK you can't just buy lightroom iOS and disable sync)
* Nothing emerged in 2016 that is stand-alone. I will make the same prediction that I made in 2016 but I'll change 2016 to 2017 :-)
    * <blockquote>By 31Dec2017 there will be an awesome iPad Pro RAW editor</blockquote>

* I think though that if you have iOS and [Cascable](https://cascable.se/) and a camera like recent Olympus, Nikon and Canon cameras, Cascable + Lightroom on iOS = pretty darn close to what I predicted (it would be 100% if there was 90% feature parity with Lightroom desktop and you could just get a mobile Lightroom subscription)

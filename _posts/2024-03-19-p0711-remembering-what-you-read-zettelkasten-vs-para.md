Instead you take the passages you found most interesting and copy them into your notes. If you ever reread those notes in the future then you can start highlighting the phrases that really spoke to you and if you reread them again, only then will you do the work to summarize the ideas in your own words.` --> See also: Forte Labs: [Progressive Summarization: A Practical Technique for Designing Discoverable Notes](https://fortelabs.com/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/?ref=zainrizvi.io)

title: "From 2018: Tobias Bernard: Banquets and Barbecues"

* Discovered Feb 4, 2021 via [Nad](https://nad.is/). [Banquets and Barbecues](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/05/16/banquets-and-barbecues/) "tl;dr: Weâ€™re splitting up Fractal into two separate apps: One to replace IRC, the other to replace Telegram."
  * Makes sense to me! I wonder how much progress has been made in the last 3 years?

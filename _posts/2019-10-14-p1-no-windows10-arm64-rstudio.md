* Add R Studio  to the list of must have apps before [I get my Surface X in 2020 or 2021 for work](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/10/11/p1-surface-x-in-late-2020-2021-if-zoom-works-wsl2-works-good-reviews/). I'm confident this will happen, how hard can it be :-) ?  [R Studio is available for lots of platforms](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) so it seems reasonable this will happen sometime  next year. Related links  
  *  [Support RStudio Server on WSL #4367](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/4367) 
* In the meantime I am running [the last  32 bit version of R Studio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206569407-Older-Versions-of-RStudio)  in the x86 emulator.
* And if I have some spare time, I'll compile it myself :-). I mean other people got it working in ARM64 Ubuntu. R Studio Server seems easier and better because then you can run R Studio in a normal Windows web browser like Firefox and then you don't need X! See:

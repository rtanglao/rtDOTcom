title: iPhone in Canada Rogers Data Plan Bingo

<p>My guess for the iPhone in Canada plan from Rogers: $75 a month plus taxes and b*gus system access fee will include 1 GB of data (2GB would be much better but it&#39;s Rogers we are talking about and we can&#39;t expect them to be innovative :-( ), unlimited incoming and outgoing text and 300 minutes of voice calls to anywhere in Canada and USA. This plan will not include voice, SMS and data roaming to the USA. Roaming will still be billed at the current Rogers r*poff rates.</p> <p>What&#39;s your guess (I am assuming all will be revealed tomorrow at 10a.m. after Jobs keynote!)????</p> <p>I&#39;ll treat the commenter with the closest guess to a tasty beverage the next time they are in Vancouver!</p>

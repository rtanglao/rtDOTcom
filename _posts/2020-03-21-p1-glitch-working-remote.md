title: "Glitch for remote work and gratuitous :-) WFH advice from me to you"
---

# Pontifications

* Glitch is recommended always even if you aren't working from home (WFH)!
* Glitch's guide: [Glitch for remote work](https://glitch.com/remote/) is also  highly recommended
* I've worked from home on and off over the last 15 years (usually only for 1 or 2 early or late meetings) but mostly at an office.
* Zoom is fantastic and so is slack and matrix, much better than irc and skype 
* Whatever the toolset is, I can add the following (but others like [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/LoveInATimeOfCoronaVirusTipsTricksAndBestPracticesForWorkingRemotely.aspx), [Andy Abramson](https://andyabramson.blogs.com/working_anywhere/) and many others have far more comprehensive WFH advice):
  * Assume positive intent!!!!
  * Get a great microphone (USB wired headset form Plantronics or Logitech is my recommendation since they are rock solid or if you must wireless than fancy bluetooth like AirPods; I don't use AirPods but many colleagues do and their audio quality is much better than the cheapie bluetooth headsets
  * Don't use the wired headset that comes with your iPhone or Android phone (if you do test it weekly because they fail silently!)!!!!!!
  * Get into an "office" routine: e.g. shower, change, put on your office badge, and go into "office" mode.

* Ryan Timpe: [brickr](https://brickr.org/) R Tidyverse module to convert graphics to Lego Bricks sounds like a lot of fun! Must try it! Maybe generate chunky Lego mosaics  of my visualizations?!? Check out this quote:

  * "**brickr** is a package for bringing the LEGOÂ® experience into the R and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem.

    The package is divided into 2 systems:

    - [**3D Models**](https://brickr.org/#3d-models): Build 3D LEGO models from data tables using [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl).

    brickr also includes tools help users create the Mosaics and 3D model output using real LEGO elements.

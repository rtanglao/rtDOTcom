All it checks is the first few bytes of the file — if you have an invalid channel file, the machine blue screens, and fails to boot. That is arguably a security vulnerability in itself. This kind of thing should have been picked up by independent testing. But it wasn’t — because nobody is looking at that, and vendors currently actively stop this level of testing from becoming public.`

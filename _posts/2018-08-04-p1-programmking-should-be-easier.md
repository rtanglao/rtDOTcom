* "It is long past time to return to designing tools not just for rock stars at Google but the vast majority of programmers and laypeople with simple small-scale problems. " <- from Jonathan Edwards [The problem with programming an dhow to fix it!](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1173)
* I've written lots about this e.g. [Everybody who writes formulas and/or uses pivot tables in a spreadsheet is a programmer](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/26/p1-everybody-who-writes-formulas-or-uses-pivot-tables-in-a-spreadsheet-is-a-programmer/) from April.

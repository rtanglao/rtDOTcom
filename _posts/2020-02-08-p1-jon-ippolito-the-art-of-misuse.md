* "What is the ultimate effect of creative misuse? Sometimes misuse  becomes the norm. In a 1976 report to the Rockefeller Foundation,  Paik coined the provocative term "electronic superhighway" --a               phrase that Bill Clinton paraphrased in his campaign rhetoric as "information superhighway" and has since permeated public consciousness.

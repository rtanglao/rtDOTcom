<p>I want MarsLiner! I think in outlines so all I want for Christmas is an outliner like MORE or Radio that outputs the <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi">MetaWeblog API</a> (including the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/docs/mtmanual_programmatic.html">Movable Type MetaWeblog API extensions</a>) so I can post to my blog text with simple markup (links, bold, italics, paragraphs and break, other tags would be nice but I don't need them!) and simple media (pictures, and audio and video for podcasts).  That's it, that's all. Brent, please change your mind because I think you could sell a ton of these things.  If not maybe <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/12/12#When:5:40:40AM">the open source outliner based on Frontier that Dave is spearheading</a> or maybe <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/beta/">Omni Outliner 3</a> with a suitable export to Meta Weblog API script (doesn't seem like it since OO 2 which I love doesn't even do links!) will give me what I want.  Otherwise, some day, I am going to have to dust off my dusty programming mitts and do it myself!</p><p>From <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&postid=3004">inessential.com: Weblog: MarsEdit report</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>But MarsLiner was to be a huge improvement, it was supposed to be the outliner of my dreams.</p>

<p>But then I discovered something important: most people don't care about outliners. And the people who do care about outliners, many of them would want the embedded media features that I didn't care about. So I realized that the market would be small, just a subset of the outliner market, which is small enough already - and there are already some great outliners already.</p>

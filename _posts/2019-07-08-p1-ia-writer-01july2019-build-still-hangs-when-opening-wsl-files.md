* [IA Writer 1.1.7121.15952 still hangs like it did in April 2019](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/04/23/p3-loving-typora-markdown-editor/) when opening  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) files. I use WSL for blogging which means my blogging workflow with IA Writer is broken and has been broken since April 2019.


* Luckily, I can use Typora instead. [Still love IA Writer though](http://rolandtanglao.com/2015/10/14/p2-love-ia-writer/). Time to file a support request I guess.

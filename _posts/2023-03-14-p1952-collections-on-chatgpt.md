[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 14, 2023 19:52  [Collections: On ChatGPT – A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog/2023/02/17/collections-on-chatgpt/) <--- Seems like a reasonable take that ChatGPT as of Febrary 2023 will not be disruptive of education and if it is it would have a negative impact. Pehaps that will change in the future! --> QUOTE `Of course that goes both ways which is why I am not going to say what capabilities machine learning may bring tomorrow. It is evidently a potentially powerful technology and I am not able to assess what it may be able to do in the future. But I can assess the observes capabilities of ChatGPT right now and talk about the implication those capabilities have in a classroom environment, which I do understand.2 That means – and I should be clear on this – this is a post about the capabilities of ChatGPT in its current form; not some other machine learning tool or AI that one imagines might exist in the future. And in that context what I see does not convince me that this technology is going to improve the learning experience; where it is disruptive it seems almost entirely negatively so and even then the disruption is less profound than one might think.`

"A couple three-in-the-morning bright ideas and a revoked access token later (oops), I now have not one but two ways to deploy to my public GitHub Pages repository from an entirely separated, private GitHub repository. In this post, I’ll take you through achieving this with Travis CI or using Netlify and Make.<br /><br />

There’s nothing hackish about it - my public GitHub Pages repository still looks the same as it does when I pushed to it locally from my terminal. Only now, I’m able to take advantage of a couple great deployment tools to have the site update whenever I push to my private repo, whether I’m on my laptop or out and about with my iPad.

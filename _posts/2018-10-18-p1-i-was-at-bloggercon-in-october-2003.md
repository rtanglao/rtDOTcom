## Pontifications

* [I was](http://scripting.com/archives/bloggerCon/I/participants/)  at [BloggerCon in 2003](http://scripting.com/2018/10/18.html)  along with Dave, Terry Heaton and many others!
* It was a blast, learned so much!
* And yes Terry Heaton is right: ["...the Web is its own culture... Those gathered a Bloggercon knew that what the web does best is connect people, but mainstreamers can only bring themselves to use it as an extension of their old, brand-oriented value propositions."](http://thepomoblog.com/index.php/the-web-is-its-own-culture/)

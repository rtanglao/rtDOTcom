[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 8, 2023 08:06 [roadrunnertwice ¦ Why Git is hard](https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/596185.html) <- amen! --> **QUOTE**: `I’ve come to a tentative two-and-a-half-part conclusion: ... 1. It is impossible to safely use Git unless you have a reliable mental model and metaphor kit for Git’s core concepts — the objects it knows about and the actions it can take on them. ... 2. Git’s core concepts are aggressively incompatible with the way most people view the world. Thus, users tend to adopt more comfortable (but non-viable) metaphors, which lead to confused and unreliable predictions. ... 2a) (Also, Git's CLI aggressively obscures those core concepts, so any learner is in an uphill battle even if their mind does happen to work the right way.)`

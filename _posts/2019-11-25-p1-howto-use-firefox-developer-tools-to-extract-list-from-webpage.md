* `"You have a webpage with a list of things: values, prices, emails, or  links. And you want to copy that into a string you can use elsewhere  like a spreadsheet or data....There’s not an API you can use to fetch these. You know that you can  construct a CSS3 selector to get them all. So you can use the developer  view of the page (a.k.a. F12) and use JavaScript on the console tab as  your ‘API’.`Read the whole fabulous thing: [Extracting a list from a webpage](https://emmas.site/blog/2019/09/10/extracting-a-list-from-a-webpage). 
* Wouldn't it be great if there was an easier way to do this? That normal people can use?

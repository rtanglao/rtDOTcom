* [Discovered]() Sep 22, 2022 19:42 [schollz/ambulation: Two SuperCollider synth tutorials.](https://github.com/schollz/ambulation) <-- QUOTE: 

```
This repo is designed to teach SuperCollider to beginners through 
two self-styled tutorials that I've designed. The theme of these 
workshops is ambulation - getting you to take your first steps to 
walk on your own with SuperCollider. Both are offered as workshops 
at Music Hackspace but all the materials are included here and 
can be used as a self-guided workshop as well.

What is SuperCollider? SuperCollider is a free platform for audio 
synthesis and algorithm composition. It really excels at real-time 
analysis, synthesis, sampling, and processing and provides a 
framework for seamless combination of audio techniques like 
additive and subtractive synthesis

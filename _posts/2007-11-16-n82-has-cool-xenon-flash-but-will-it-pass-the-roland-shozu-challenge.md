title: N82 has cool Xenon flash but will it pass the Roland Shozu Challenge?

<p>The N82 was released today with great fanfare (rightly so since it&#39;s the first Nokia with a real flash!) and some fun <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2007/11/14/video-23-minute-qa-session-with-the-nokia-n82-product-manager.html">video</a> but nobody has told me whether it can pass the &quot;Roland Challenge&quot; and the <a href="http://mobilereportcard.com/task/roland-shozu-challenge-publishing-lots-photos-flickr-shozu-until-s60-crashes">&quot;Roland ShoZu Challenge&quot;</a>. I&#39;m hoping the latest Nokias like the N95-3 and the N82 pass because of their increased RAM.</p><p>p.s. in case you forgot, here&#39;s the Roland Challenge: take 50 pictures in 30 minutes of random stuff and see if the phone or camera app crashes (without any 3rd party software installed and a freshly formatted 2Gig or larger card)</p><p>p.p.s. and here&#39;s the Roland ShoZu Challenge: Repeat the Roland Challenge but install ShoZu first and set ShoZu to auto-upload and again let me know if ShoZu, camera app or the phone crashes </p>

* Given a CSV file saved to `~/Documents/sample-hour-count-colorname.csv` 
```csv
hour,count,colour
1,5,red
1,2,green
2,10,red
2,3,blue
3,2,green
3,5,red
```
* Then the following R code creates an encircled plot

```r
hh = read_csv("~/Documents/sample-hour-count-colorname.csv")
gg <- ggplot(hh, aes(hour, count))
p <- gg + geom_encircle(aes(group=colour,colour=I(colour))) + geom_point()
p
```
results in the following output graph

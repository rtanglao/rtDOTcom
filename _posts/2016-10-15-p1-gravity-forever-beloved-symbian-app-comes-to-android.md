## Pontifications

* Late to the party, but I found out [recently](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/786573478107287553) that the beloved Symbian twitter & RSS app, [Gravity, is now available on Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mobileways.gravityforever) as [Gravity Forever](https://twitter.com/GravityForever)!
* Yay! Hopefully I'll blog a review here in the near future.

[Don't despair first of all especially if you are in Canada](http://thewalrus.ca/canada-in-the-age-of-donald-trump/)! Make Canada work! Make multiculturalism work!

Be nice be good, show up in real life for things that matter where you live with non geek folks and [write software for good](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/).

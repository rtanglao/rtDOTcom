title: "ME:: Affordable housing is not a puzzle or rocket science. Allow and encourage co-housing, co-ops, 4 storey low rise apartments everywhere in the city of Vancouver and multi-dwellings strata and non strata non single family homes everywhere. The government (municipal, provincial and federal all working together) must build affordable rentals and must keep the rent low and keep building affordable rentals and keep allocating them to folks working locally, the 'market' and private developers are incapable of doing this, follow Vienna's example etc etc :-) ; Emilie K Adin::I Love These Streets.

I believe in all people in their amazing diversity not ideology. All people deserve affordable housing.

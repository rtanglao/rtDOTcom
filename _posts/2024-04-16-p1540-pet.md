[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Apr 16, 2024 15:40 [knqyf263/pet: Simple command-line snippet manager](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet?tab=readme-ov-file#register-the-previous-command-easily) <-- looks great except what if i want a multi-line snipet. Seems like it only does 1 line (but the line of course can have multiple commands)

## Pontifications

* I loved the fact that I was able to make more and better t-shirts from my [visualizations](https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=roland&tags=infoviz&sort=date-posted-desc).
* Loved that I got back into blogging almost daily starting September.
* Loved that I was able to finish the 15km Payak Cross-Country Ski Race on my classic skis back in February.
* Loved that I am able to bicycle (except during snowmaggedeons).
* How about you?

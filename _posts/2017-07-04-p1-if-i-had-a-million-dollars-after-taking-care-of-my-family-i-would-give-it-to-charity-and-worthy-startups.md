## Pontifications

* If I had a million dollars left over after taking care of my family (education and retirement == "taking care") it would go to charity and worthy startups - wouldn't become a VC or Angel investor
* "worthy" means GBLTQ or some sort of folks of colour with a great idea. I'd help find advisers but absolutely no strings attached! i.e. no equity, no "control" of any sort. "Control" is for other people LOL!
* And yes I am crazy :-) because this is unlikely to happen!!!!!

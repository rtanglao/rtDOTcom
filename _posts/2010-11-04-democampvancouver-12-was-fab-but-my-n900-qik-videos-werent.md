<p>Really Enjoyed <a href="http://bootup.ca/1652/democamp-vancouver-12/">DemoCamp Vancouver 12</a> yesterday. Great Venue. Great energy from some great pitches and some great looking companies and ideas. Best yet. The only thing that could be improved is lighting for videos :-). Can we shine a light on the presenters next time? Just kidding! Some sample videos (I was able to stream about 16 or 17 including <a href="http://qik.com/video/17546803">happy birthday to Justin</a> of <a href="http://49pixels.ca/">49 pixels</a> and all the pitches) after the jump of <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/theperfectsong/">The Perfect Song</a> and <a href="http://www.quikpiq.com/">QuikPiq</a>&nbsp;(randomly selected!).</p><p>I was disappointed by my N900 live-streamed Qik Videos:</p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">The videos are too dark! But what can you expect from a cameraphone :-) Hope the N8 is better in low light. Or perhaps I should think of a portable light. Anybody know of a portable lighting solution?</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">I was also disappointed by the Qik application itself which seems to have lost (or maybe it's an N900 or Maemo bug) the 6 presentations that were buffered in the N900 Qik application but Windmobile couldn't stream fast enough in real time (probably because of Wind's nascent, un-tuned un-optimized 3G network and lack of base stations).</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

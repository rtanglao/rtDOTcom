(mine didn&#39;t turn out i.e. most of my track is missing since I had to reboot the phone thereby losing my GPS Track, aaaaargh! Jean hasn&#39;t posted his!)<br /> <strong>Things that were Great</strong> <ol>   <li>The weather! Perfect!</li>    <li>Jean&#39;s McGyvered bicycle mount - although I am investigating using the <a href="http://thenokiablog.com/2008/06/12/review-proclip-car-mount-kit-for-nokia-n95-8gb-and-nokia-n82/">N95 ProClip Motorcycle Mount</a>, anybody know whether it will work on a bicycle?</li>    <li>The event itself. Rockin&#39; great time at all venus. Great food, great happenings (e.g. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/mojave">mojave</a>, Paul Jarvis&#39; band, Japanese food, African Drum circle, etc)</li>    <li>Qik was rock solid. It just worked and buffered when we lost connection.</li> </ol><br /> <strong>Things that weren&#39;t so great</strong> <ol>   <li>Rogers Portable Internet combined with FreeTheNet combined with splash screen = FAIL (or at least it seemed to fail a lot more than during our 2 dry runs during today&#39;s bike ride, actually we did stream a lot more video than I thought). Next time I suggest EV-DO card from Bell or a HSDPA card (i.e. something designed for mobile connectivity, Rogers Mobile Internet is designed to be portable NOT mobile) plus a travel router like the $170 <a href="http://www.evdoinfo.com/content/view/2355/63/">Cradlepoint CTR500 EVDO/HSDPA 3G Router</a> . I am a supporter of FreeTheNet but again it&#39;s designed for non mobile use.</li>    <li>My IOGear Mobile Portable Power loose connection with my N95 caused me to run out out of power at one point - Jean&#39;s N82 had no problem so probably an issue with my phone, not the IOGear power.But probably points to the fact that the Nokia power connector wasn&#39;t designed to be connected horizontally for charging. I&#39;d prefer a micro USB / mini USB for charging personally</li>    <li>Nokia Sports Tracker&#39;s 1998isms (I realize it&#39;s beta but if they had used Drupal or any modern system they&#39;d get these things for free) - i) Bad URLs that end in .do instead of being clean ii) no search feature iii) no tags iv) no RSS for tags</li>    <li>Qik&#39;s tags have no RSS feeds</li> </ol>

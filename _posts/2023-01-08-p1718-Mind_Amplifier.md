that are so essential to our lives as the tools they really are, and examine
how we may use those tools to, in turn, design more humane and effective
technology. Ultimately, I will explore how we can use our machines and
digital media to create an informed and socially conscious form of mind-
extension. The root ideas are not my original creations. Rather, by linking
together the work of media historians, cognitive psychologists, and
computer visionaries, I hope to provide a framework to guide our future
use of machines-to-think-with. In our species’ self-interest, we need to
understand the human-computer symbiosis in which we’ve become
enmeshed.`

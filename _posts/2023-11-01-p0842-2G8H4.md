[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 1, 2023 08:42 [AI generated images are biased, showing the world through stereotypes - Washington Post](https://archive.ph/2G8H4#selection-449.0-453.209) <-- nothing new here sadly, everything "AI" is biased towards the dominant hegemony --> **QUOTE:**: `Artificial intelligence image tools have a tendency to spin up disturbing clichés: Asian women are hypersexual. Africans are primitive. Europeans are worldly. Leaders are men. Prisoners are Black....These stereotypes don’t reflect the real world; they stem from the data that trains the technology. Grabbed from the internet, these troves can be toxic — rife with p*rnography, m*sogyny, violence and b*gotry.`

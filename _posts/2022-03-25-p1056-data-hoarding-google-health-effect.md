[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 25, 2022. 10:56   Charlie Warzel: [Confessions of an Information Hoarder](https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/623d45efdc551a00208acf88/data-hoarding-google-health-effect/) <--- QUOTE: `For me, iPhone photos have become more about the action of taking them than what I do with them. They’re meant, instead, to add texture to that near-infinite scroll of the camera roll. They’re meant, probably, as proof that I’m alive and in the world. They’re meant for the mosaic. I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but it’s definitely a product of being able to take and save as many as I could ever want to.` END QUOTE <--- I do this for the same reason and ALSO to make art later.

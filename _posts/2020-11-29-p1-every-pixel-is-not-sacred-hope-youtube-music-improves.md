title: "YouTube Music has issues that Google Play Music didn't: can't reliably play downloaded playlists, etc"

*  [i tried to switch from google play music to youtube music but oddly :-) it doesn't reliably play my downloaded 1077 song playlist unlike google play music on my iPhone SE 2020 using the latest iOS 14.x](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1332959866915233792) [#weAllMakeShttySoftware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/weAllMakeShttySoftware)
*  "Every pixel isn't sacred (TM)"  :-) so I won't complain about the different UX just for the sake of complaining :-) If I think of something substantial to complain about I'll tweet and blog it.

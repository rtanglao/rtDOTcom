Can I buy a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> Pro Premium, please (I am already at 86% for this month and it's only November 14th)?  Or maybe it could be like Blogware, where I could pay a fixed price per gigabyte that I go over.  I'd be willing to pay $5/gigabyte that I go over on Flickr.  I really can't believe I take so many photos and that they take so much space.  What happens when I buy a 6 or 8 megapixel SLR (which I plan to in Christmas 2005)? I really don't want to upload reduced resolution because then I have to worry about backing up the high res originals.  I realize that I am not a "typical" user but I am sure that there will be more and more people like me. Anybody who has a kid  and takes 4 megapixel images will eventually be have the same problem methinks which means there are lots of people like me!

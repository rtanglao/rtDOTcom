## Pontifications
* [Okay, WTF Is Ethereum? aka Ethereum Primer from Vice Motherboard](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/okay-wtf-is-ethereum) is fab; I think!
* [But the real question is where is the garden? This is the stream.](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/03/p1-slack-is-the-ultimate-stream-tool/)
* [I don't 100% trust Wikipedia for this; I wish Vice or somebody with sustainable funding  would take on wikipedia and get around its not-so-great culture](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/06/09/p1-going-to-summarize-technical-topics/).

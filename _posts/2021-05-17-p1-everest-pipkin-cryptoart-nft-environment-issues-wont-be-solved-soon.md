* Juicy Quote:

BEGIN QUOTE:

""**However, we must get there through collective empowerment and strong social  programs like universal basic income, universal healthcare, divestment  from warfare and policing, a regulated real estate market that does not  capitalize on housing scarcity and rent, worker unions, food programs,  environmental protections, and actual, functioning income taxes on the  wealthy.** An individualist fantasy of a pyramid scheme, made to  reward investors over artists and directly thieving from our shared  future just isn’t it.

  Many would call me unrealistic and naïve for this, unwilling to make  compromises in the world we are living now because of an idealistic  vision of a tomorrow; and to them I would like to say that we literally  invented an extra-sovereign monetary system that within 10 years has  generated trillions of dollars of worth and is held up with the power  consumption of a small country.

Let this whole horrible chapter of history convince you that money is fake, we can do anything with it we want, and that we do not want cryptoart."

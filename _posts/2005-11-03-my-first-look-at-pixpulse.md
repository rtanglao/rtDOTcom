<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: I changed the title because for some reason Google was ranking it high for Pixpulse and people were misinterpreting what I said. To be precise, email is great for now for most phones which means there definitely is a market for services like PixPulse that use email. In the future, though, I think things will be more like ShoZu. Time will tell whether my &quot;Roland&#39;s mobile law&quot; :-) will actually be true. Certainly not true in 2006. Probably be different in 2010 or 2015.]&nbsp;</p><p>Roland&#39;s mobile law: Any mobile service that relies on email to upload multimedia content will not succeed.</p>  <p>Sorry PixPulse but I can&#39;t recommend you because emailing photos and videos just doesn&#39;t work on mobile devices.

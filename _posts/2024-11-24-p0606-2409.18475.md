So many tools so little time :-) --> **QUOTE**: `LIDA (Dibia, 2023) is an open-source tool that enables goal- based data visualization generation by generating, refin-ing, filtering, and executing code to produce visualizations.It also includes an infographer module that creates data-faithful, stylized graphics using image generation models. The system supports multiple Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair, for visualization generation. ChatGPTâ€™s code interpreter API (Cheng et al., 2023) lets users upload their dataset and pose queries in natural language (e.g., analyze the trend of renewable energy over time).

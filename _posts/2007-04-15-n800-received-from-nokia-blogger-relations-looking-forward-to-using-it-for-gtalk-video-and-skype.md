<p> Got my free trial Nokia N800 from Nokia Blogger Relations on Thursday (thanks Nokia and <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy</a>). Haven&#39;t had much time for fun video, voice and other N800 geekery yet (fun with the Canucks in the playoffs, work and family has taken up too much time :-) !). Have to install new update to the N800 operating system and have bought two 2 GB SD cards to store music and my experiments.  Looking forward to video GTalking (rolandt AT gmail.com) with you  all (I&#39;ll finally be able to see <a href="http://www.ipadventures.com/">Ken Camp</a>!).  </p><p> First impressions:  </p><ol> <li>Have had one spontaneous reboot already of the N800 (I thought this only happened with S60). Hope this is fixed in latest N800 update.</li> <li>The built in  Opera web browser is fabulous! </li><li>The automatic WiFi detector works great!</li> </ol>

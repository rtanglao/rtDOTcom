# Pontifications

* Experts don't have to be grumpy :-)
* Experts can be technical and nurturing :-)  (especially if you equip them with "[De-ranting: Making non constructive feedback visible only to the person who posted it )](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/27/p1-remove-insults-rants-non-constructive-feedback/)"-type tools)
* Just because you don't often run into non grumpy, friendly, nurturing experts , doesn't mean they don't exist; that you definitely can nurture a culture where more of these folks exist.
* The above came to mind after reading Feverbee's  [Archetypes ](https://www.feverbee.com/archetypes/)

<p>I am going to try to make this one because I love<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rhondasalias/"> Rhonda's photos</a> and what she's been <a href="http://www.staticphotography.com/blog/2">blogging about on photography</a>.</p>  <p>From <a href="http://www.staticphotography.com/node/84">Rhonda Fast's Photography Opening @ Wicked Cafe in Vancouver | static photography</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Static Photography's Rhonda Fast is having a photography show at Wicked Cafe in Vancouver. Her show is part of a 12 month series we're running that features emerging Vancouver photographers and Rhonda is the 3rd artist to exhibit. Her show is titled &quot;Strike&quot;.</p>  <p>Artist's Statement: &quot;The idea behind minimalist art is that it lacks concept, focusing on geometric shape, monochromatic color palettes and anonymity of style. That's where the journey for &quot;Strike&quot; began. However, as will happen, it evolved, concept started to develop and location became of utmost importance. Strike is a new look at the commonplace; a twist on the mundane of an iconic pastime. An exploration in minimalism with concept.&quot; </p> <p>The show will run for about a month and we'd love for you to join us at the opening on December 16th @ 7pm. </p> <p>Wicked Cafe<br /> 7th &amp; Hemlock Vancouver, BC</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/12/23/my_merry_christmas_publicast_and_some_predictions_for_2005">2005, the year of making money off blogs and RSS continues</a>. Congrats to <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/">Nick</a>! Please re-brand NewsGator Online to something else as I've suggested before. I am sure <a href="http://sheila.inessential.com/">Sheila</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent</a> and <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> are the next to get acquired and hopefully in the  fullness of time make lots more money!

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Update: It is a done deal. More details here on Business 2.0 weblog, posted by me of course. Its a cash-and-stock deal, and Nick will joing Newsgator. The big question in my mind: will Newsgator finally buy a Mac desktop application and fill out the obvious hole in its product portfolio.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

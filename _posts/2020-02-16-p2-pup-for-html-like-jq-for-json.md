* "[pup](https://github.com/ericchiang/pup) is a command line tool for processing HTML. It reads from stdin, prints to stdout, and allows the user to filter parts of the page using [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors).

   Inspired by [jq](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/), pup aims to be a fast and flexible way of exploring HTML from the terminal."

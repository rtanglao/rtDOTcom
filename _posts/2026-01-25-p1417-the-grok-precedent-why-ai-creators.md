## QUOTE:

>That’s the new math. Development time plus legal review time plus evaluation time. The last one isn’t optional anymore.

>We build evaluation suites as part of the development process now. Not after. During. Every prompt variation, every edge case, every jailbreak attempt. They always find something. Always. The question is whether you find it before your users do—or before a prosecutor does.

>RBAC and multi-tenancy aren’t optional. Sales sees sales data. HR sees HR data. Client A’s context never touches Client B’s model. Ever. You’d be surprised how many vendors skip this.

>Audit trails for everything. Every prompt. Every response. Every action. When a regulator asks what your AI generated on a specific date, you need the answer.

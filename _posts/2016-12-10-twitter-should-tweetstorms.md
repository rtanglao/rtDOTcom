title: Twitter Tactics -- First class platform support for tweetstorms
---

[As I've blogged before, I don't think twitter will survive and it has problems with hate speech and hate controls that for some silly reason, it refuses to address although many have given well considered solutions](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/31/p1-twitter-nonprofit-clone/).

Anyhow until they go evil or go out of business :-), in the same way twitter added platform support for "@ mentions" and "#" for hashtags, support should be added for [tweetstorms](http://tweetstorm.io/). Why? It's a great user generated feature that everybody uses.  And it would make twitter even more of a "blogs for the masses who are too lazy to blog" platform. (I prefer blogging a link to a blog post over tweetstorms obviously :-) !!!!!)

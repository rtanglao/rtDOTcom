[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 7, 2025 07:23 [Recipes that work:: Caroline's Cooking:: German red cabbage with apples (Rotkohl)](https://www.carolinescooking.com/braised-red-cabbage-with-apples/) <-- We made it with a heaping teaspoon of apricot jam. And we only simmered the cabbage for 15 minutes instead of 30. Smelled like the delicious food I had in Germany :-)

Can&#39;t do that with CDMA = major<br />      disadvantage<br />    - whole world except canada, usa, korea, japan use GSM<br />    - GSM in Canada = Rogers and Fido (not so great coverage outside<br />      cities), Bell and Telus = CDMA<br />    - GSM becoming more popular in US, nonexistent in 1998 now almost<br />      everywhere thanks to T Mobile and Cingular<br />    - If you buy from Bell and Telus you are locked into their limited<br />      CDMA devices<br />    - Recommendation: go with Fido or Rogers and don&#39;t get a contract<br />      if you can afford not to! unless you need the great rural<br />      coverage of Bell and Telus so you can buy cool devices from grey<br />      market/asia/europe if/when you need them. Bell, Telus, Fido and<br />      Rogers don&#39;t offer any really cool mobile devices.<br />- future (2010 and beyond)<br />    - flat rate pricing, current pricing is byzantine <br />    - all devices work anywhere in the world, no need to worry about<br />      CDMA, GSM and other crazy tech terms<br />    - create and share anything (phone calls, video calls, audio, text,<br />      videos, photos)  anytime with anybody from your mobile device for<br />      $50-$100/month, no Canadian affordable unlimited general purpose<br />      plans to do this today and the networks are too slow<br />- Mobile Power user or geek<br />    - Come to BarCamp Vancouver August 25th and participate or lead   <br />      a session, it&#39;s free (suggested 20$ donation)<br />    - barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver<br /><br /></pre>

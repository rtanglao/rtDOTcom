Don’t put all your eggs in the evolution-proof basket. It isn’t going to work. The story’s going to end the same way as it did last time. ... But if you come in with a multipronged strategy where you limited onward spread from long-term infections, you develop combination therapies for long-term infections, you use the multipronged approach to reduce the viral load, including deploying things like HEPA filters and far-UVC and monitoring viral load in public spaces, now you have a fighting shot. If you then use a variety of different vaccines to really maximize the diversity of neutralizing antibodies at a population level, the odds of slowing viral evolution down to a crawl start looking good.`

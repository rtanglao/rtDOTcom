[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 4, 2022 14:03 [Christine Lemmer-Webber:The Heart of Spritely: Distributed Objects and Capability Security](https://spritely.institute/static/papers/spritely-core.html)  and earlier blog post from CLW:[If you can't tell people anything, can you show them?](https://dustycloud.org/blog/if-you-cant-tell-people-anything/)<-- QUOTE: `Spritely's core layers of abstraction make building secure peer-to-peer applications as natural as any other programming model. Spritely provides an integrated system for distributed asynchronous programming, transactional error handling, time-travel debugging, and safe serialization. All this under a security model resembling ordinary reference passing, reducing most considerations to a simple slogan: "If you don't have it, you can't use it."` <--- see also [A Conceptual Introduction to Spritely Goblins](https://garbados.github.io/my-blog/conceptual-intro-to-spritely-goblins.html) <-- QUOTE: `In the end, once the standards are formalized and the tooling fully implemented, the details of this arcana will be utterly beneath a user's notice. To them, the invite code works like an invite code; the chatroom works like a chatroom. Under the hood, a profound sophistication belies and befits the advanced requirements of distributed digital social systems. No longer will we have to ham-fist our modes of relation into artifacts like blockchains or instances, gluing brittle access schemes atop them. By virtue of decades of compounded effort and expertise, we will at last able to code decentralized programs with nuanced permissions from the outset.`

Laugh out loud that somebody could actually publish such a report and charge people $1000 for it! Maybe this kind of thing could have flown in 1999 but not in 2004 when Sun, Microsoft and many more have 1000s of corporate blogs.

A news release hit the wires today from Dublin-based Research and Markets . Here&#8217;s a tiny sample:
<br />
<br />&#8220;Companies Need to Raise Employee Awareness Regarding Blogging and Associated Threats &#8230; Blogging is rapidly emerging as a threat to Internet users.&#8221;
<br />
<br />I&#8217;ve been shaking my head ever since I read this ham-fisted, inflammatory piece of fear-mongering, but I still can&#8217;t quell the shrill noise in my ears. It&#8217;s the chilling bleat of innocent young clues being slaughtered in a mahogany-panelled boardroom somewhere to the south...

<br />Research and Markets is kind of a wholesaler or clearing house for 3rd-party research. Styling themselves the &#8220;World&#8217;s largest Market Research resource&#8221;, their business model appears to involve sourcing reports from a variety of analysts and publishers, slapping a healthy markup on them, and brokering the same gently-used materials to their unquestioning clients.

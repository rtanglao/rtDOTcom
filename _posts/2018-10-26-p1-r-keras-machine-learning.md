## Pontifications

* Found via [Bernhard Learns - Trying out R's keras API - Can we predict the ETH price with recurrent neural networks?](http://www.bernhardlearns.com/2018/10/trying-out-rs-keras-api.html) 
* The R keras package is called [Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) of course LOL
* and how did I miss the book? [Deep Learning with R](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-r) published February 2018, d'oh!

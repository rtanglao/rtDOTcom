## Pontifications

(inspired by [No, I Don't Want To Configure Your App](https://robotlolita.me/2016/01/09/no-i-dont-want-to-configure-your-app.html) ! )

* Notes from Destroy all Software: [A Whole new world](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/a-whole-new-world) 
* Nobody replaces low level infrastructure or thinks about a full redesign of VT100 i.e. terminals, and other infrastructure above it.
* Need to go beyond "always shipping", need to think, step back and improve things and this needs "hammock time" :-) (like Clojure's creation took 2 years). Amen!

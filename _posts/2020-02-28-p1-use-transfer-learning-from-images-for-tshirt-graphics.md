* "Machine learning engineering is becoming a real ecosystem

  Looking at software engineering as a parallel, we typically see ecosystems “mature” in pretty standard patterns.

  A new programming language will emerge with some exciting features, and  people will use it for specialized use-cases, research projects, and  toys. At this stage, anyone who uses it has to build all their basic  utilities from scratch.

  Down the line, people within the community develop libraries and projects  that abstract common utilities away, until the tooling is capable and  stable enough to be used in production.
  
  ...
  
  In this approach, a team takes a pre-trained model and removes/retrains  the last layers of the model to focus on a new, related task.

* I think it is and it isn't. It is but as a newbie there are far too many choices. Hard to figure out where to start!

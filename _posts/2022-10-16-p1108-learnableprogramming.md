Learning about "for" loops is not learning to program, any more than learning about pencils is learning to draw.
People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it.` <-- AMEN! Thought I blogged about this but it appears I haven't! See also [Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/)

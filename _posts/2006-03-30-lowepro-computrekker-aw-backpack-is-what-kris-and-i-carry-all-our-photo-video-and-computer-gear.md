It ain't stylish being all black but it does the job and it does the job well. Highly recommended.</p><p>From <a href="http://lowepro.com/Products/Backpacks/notebook_camera/CompuTrekker_AW.aspx">Lowepro - CompuTrekker AW</a>.:</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>A perfect combination for photo gear and notebook computer, the CompuTrekker AW was designed specifically for digital photographers. Photojournalists and location photographers will find it a great travel companion. The backpack's reinforced construction, shock-absorbing closed-cell foam padding and tough, water-resistant outer fabric protects contents from moisture and sudden impacts. The patented All Weather Cover(tm) offers maximum protection from extreme weather conditions, dust and sand. A padded notebook compartment is secured with both zipper and quick-release buckle; while the main camera compartment is fully customizable with adjustable padded dividers. A quick-access hide-away Tripod Mount(tm), SlipLock(tm) attachment loops and a number of laminated and zippered organizer pockets provide photographers with fast, easy access to equipment.</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

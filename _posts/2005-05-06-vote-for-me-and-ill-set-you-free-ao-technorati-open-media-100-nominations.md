<p>Nominate me today, operators standing by :-) ! I figure what we (<a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter">Richard</a>, <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter">Boris</a>, <a href="http://kriskrug.com/">Kris</a> and myself) are doing with blogging and citizen journalism at <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/">VanEats</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/">Urban Vancouver</a>, <a href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com/">2010</a>, <a href="http://www.battlestaraggregatica.com/">Battlestar Aggregatica</a>, <a href="http://photographyhack.com/">Photography Hack</a>, and podcasting at <a href="http://dogmaradio.com/">Dogma Radio</a> etc. qualifies under "Trendsetters" and "Practitioners" and what <a href="http://bryght.com/">Bryght</a> (I would nominate Boris, <a href="http://walkah.net/">James</a>, and <a href="http://daemon.co.za">Adrian</a>) has done with technology like <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and projects like <a href="http://ourmedia.org">Ourmedia</a>  qualifies under "Tool Smiths".  But of course, I am biased!</p>

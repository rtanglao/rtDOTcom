Is there a line a “Modern Conservative” (as opposed to a small-c conservative) is not permitted to cross in the struggle against the forces of leftism, even if it meant accepting the liberalization and pluralization of American life? ...The answer the leaders of the modern Right have given themselves and us, over and over again, is: No, there is not.`

title: Change Agent review aka CRISPR-maggedon is the latest apocalypse 
---

## Pontifications
* [Change Agent](http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536914/change-agent-by-daniel-suarez/9781101984666/) is a terrible book aka [I agree with the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15162608/change-agent-daniel-suarez-movie-option-genetic-engineering-review) but it is a frighteningly entertaining extrapolation of how [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)-like technology could screw us.
* CRISPR-maggedon like previous armaggedons like nuclear winter, acid rain, global climate change-maggedon, etc  all are possible and we should try to prevent them but the real danger is conventional warfare started by the threat of one of these armaggedons.

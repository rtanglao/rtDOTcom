## Pontifications

* NB: It is important to point out that the ```reshape2``` package which includes ```melt``` and ```cast``` has been superseded by the [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package which includes ```gather``` and ```spread```! 
* But the original paper is still worth reading: [Wickham, Hadley. 2014. “Tidy Data.” Journal of Statistical Software Volume 59 (Issue 10)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)  at some point (I bet it is summarized/explained even better in one of the books that Wickham wrote that I already bought like the [R for Data Science](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/01/24/p1-reading-hadley-wickhams-r-data-science-book/) book:-) !)

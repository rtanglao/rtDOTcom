title: "Great software teams ship regularly (every 10 weeks or less) and have a process for iteratively shaping their software"

* Read  the whole thing [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup): Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters. Love the shaping concept: "Second, we **shape the work** before giving it to a team. A
  small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define 
  the key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet
  on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete 
  enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they 
  have room to work out the interesting details themselves."
* I think 6-8 weeks like Mozilla and Basecamp does is about right.
* And there is no one size fits all; each software team will have its own process for scoping and breaking down  features  into manageable as well as useable  chunks.

# Pontifications

* Inspired by my previous post from April 21, 2019 : [Idea: make a tshirt with the m\*eller report  r\*dacted with 50% of the thumbnails on front and 50% on back and call it  of course 'mrstardacted'](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/04/21/p1-mrstardacted/)
* Text thumbnails of open source contributions as art for the win :-) (I'd make my thumbnails pink on white instead of black on white naturally or maybe even white on pink)

<p>Got my N78 yesterday  from Nokia Blogger Relations yesterday (thanks!).</p><p>&quot;Blink&quot; reactions to the phone:</p><ol><li>I like candybar phones<br /></li><li>Why does the phone pre-flash even when I turn the flash off (I know it&#39;s to focus but why?  The N95-1 didn&#39;t do this!!)? Can I turn off the pre-flash off?<br /></li><li>I don&#39;t like the small buttons on the numeric keypad. I keep hiting &quot;7&quot; instead of &quot;*&quot;</li><li>Not a fan of brown. Can I have pink, green, orange, purple or some fun colour :-) ?</li><li>Nice and light. The N95 feels very heavy in comparison</li><li>Don&#39;t like the buttons in general: too small</li><li>I wish it would charge via Micro USB<br /></li></ol><p>&quot;Blink&quot; reactions to the S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 2 software:</p><ol><li>As a experienced S60 user, I don&#39;t like the text in the middle e.g. &quot;Open&quot; - When I first saw that, I though hmmm, is there a new button in the middle? Of course there isn&#39;t. you just press the dpad in the middle to select that operation</li><li>The zooming effects of the UI are ok but I could live without it. Rather have the menus simplified and fixed! <br /></li></ol><p>Bonus:</p><p>My unboxing video taken by the <a href="http://feasthouse.wordpress.com/">incomparable social media maven Dave Olson </a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

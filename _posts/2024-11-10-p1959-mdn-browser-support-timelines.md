[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 10, 2024 19:59  [MDN Browser Support Timelines](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/11/mdn-browser-support-timelines/) <-- the "assembly and iterating" requires humans for now :-) --> See the prompt for the timeline: [Web Locks API Browser Support Timeline](https://gist.github.com/simonw/1af1cd4f51c3dc2fa84cca0fa4746a7e) --> **QUOTE**: `95% of the code was written by LLMs, but I did a whole lot of assembly and iterating to get it to the finished state. Three of the transcripts for that:
Web Locks API Browser Support Timeline in which I paste in the original API JSON and ask it to come up with a timeline visualization for it.
    Enhancing API Feature Display with URL Hash where I dumped in a more complex JSON example to get it to show multiple APIs on the same page, and also had it add #fragment bookmarking to the tool
    Fetch GitHub API Data Hierarchy where I got it to write me an async JavaScript function for fetching a directory listing from that tree API.`

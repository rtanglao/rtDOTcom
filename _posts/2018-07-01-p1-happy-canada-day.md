## Pontifications
* [The people's internet will be overlayed on top of the existng commercial internet I wrote yesterday](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/30/p1-the-peoples-internet/) .
* This doesn't mean it's full of bad stuff or questionable stuff. It can and should be just as diverse and a force for good.

## QUOTE

>“The president, offering no evidence, insisted upon his version of the story.”
>“The president extemporized with a blithe disregard for established fact.”
>“Confounding experts and antagonizing the historical record, the president painted his own, rosier portrait of events.”
>“The president, perhaps inadvertently, wound up smudging the line between empirical verification and his own boundless optimism.”
>“The president once again found himself galloping ahead of reality’s leisurely pace.”
>“The president dabbled anew in the shallow pond of misrepresentation, filling his beak with succulent morsels hidden among the reeds.”
>“The president’s most recent encounter with the specter of honesty caught him wrong-footed.”

title: "Thank you Mozilla! Leaving after being laid off after 11 years #mozillalifeboat"
---
*   I was one of the [250 people laid off last week by Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/).
*   I leave with nothing but gratitude for the open web, Firefox, Thunderbird, the amazing Mozilla staff and most importantly the fab Mozilla volunteers.
*   Really enjoyed being the Thunderbird support lead, then the Firefox Android support coordinator and finally the Firefox Support Analyst and Support Release Manager
*   Onwards! #thanks #lucky 
*   I'll take a few days off and then start my next.gig.search
*   I can be reached on linkedIn: [rtanglao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rtanglao/), twitter:[rtanglao](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/), roland AT rolandtanglao.com

# Pontifications

* Again via Stephen Downes, [Eleventy Love](https://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=70372), I found the following links:
  * Chris Coyier [Eleventy Love](https://css-tricks.com/eleventy-love/)
  * Chris links to two useful tutorials: 
    * [Zach Leatherman: Build your own Blog from Scratch using Eleventy](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/) <--- perhaps this will help me add tags to my restaurant review 1 pager site (see [My new 1 pager restaurant reviews site hosted on glitch using eleventy](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/11/03/p2-new-food-review-1pager-site-using-11ty/)). It could also be out of date since it's from 2018

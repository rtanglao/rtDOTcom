I’m perfectly comfort­able in the both/and. I accept the invi­ta­tion of the slab; I benefit daily from the leverage it grants me. I am, at the same time, certain my functions and notebooks will be blown away before the decade is out; maybe just by the leviathan’s restlessness, or maybe by something more dire....I’d like a perma­com­puter of my own.`

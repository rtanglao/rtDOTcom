# Pontifications

* jscher's amazing [Printable Extension for Firefox](https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ext/printable.html) ([AMO Listing](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/printable-the-print-doctor/)) <-- "Printable was created to address my own frustrations, but judging by  the growing number of users, other people are finding it useful as well." <-- It fixes or at least tries to fix  `display: flex`, custom fonts, fixed position elements and more 
* Printing is and will always be problematic. My workaround is to save as PDF and print in Preview on OS X which isn't a workaround if you don't have a Mac (I have both Windows and Mac)

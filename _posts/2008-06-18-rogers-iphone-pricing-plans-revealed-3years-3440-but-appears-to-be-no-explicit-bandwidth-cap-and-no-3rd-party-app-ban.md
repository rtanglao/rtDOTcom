<p>So the questions start:</p> <ol>   <li>Is there a bandwidth cap?</li>    <li>Are 3rd party applications like ShoZu and Qik (if ShoZu and Qik don&#39;t port to the iPhone others will) allowed?</li> </ol> <p>IF</p> <p>ShoZu-like and Qik-like applications appear on the iPhone 3G and they work well and Rogers allows them with a reasonable bandwidth cap (reasonable to my multi-media creation needs is 2GB YMMV :-) !!!),</p> <p>THEN (it&#39;s not a r*poff, hurrah!) AND I&#39;ll get a 3G iPhone (since net-net, it&#39;s only about $10 a month more to pay than my current $50 per month grandfathered EDGE Fido plan).</p> <p>The only thing that still gives me pause is the 3 year contract but I can live with it if the apps are there!</p> <p>So I guess I don&#39;t buy one on my birthday but wait to see if the 3rd party apps that I want appear and if Rogers allows them.</p>From <a href="http://wirelessnorth.ca/2008/06/18/rogers-iphone-pricing-plans-revealed-3years-3440/"><cite>Wirelessnorth.ca » Blog Archive » Rogers iPhone pricing plans revealed: 3years $3440</cite></a>:  <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   <p>$199 + 36months x $90 = $3440 and that’s if you buy the cheap one. Don’t forget the GST/PST.</p>    <p>However, you’ll probably realize you are likely to spend at least that much on cellphone service in the next three years, no matter what your plan.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

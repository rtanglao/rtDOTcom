Interesting times.  I still think <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is more compelling than <a href="http://picasa.com/google/">Picasa/Google</a> because Flickr is cross platform (Mac, PC, Linux, mobile phones), and cross blog (MovableType, TypePad, Blogware, Manila) unlike Picasa/Google 

Google plan seems to be: offer free services that will get people to post their stuff (including email, blog text posts and blog photo posts) in order for Google to make money off of AdSense, i.e. context specific ads.

From <a href="http://postneo.com/2004/07/17.html#a3491">&#160;Picasa from Google - Matt Croydon::postneo</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Google is wasting no time on their purchase:

<blockquote>Free! Organize your digital photos. Download Picasa from Google.</blockquote>

The main Picasa page complies with google's non-evil policies:

<blockquote>The download itself contains only the Picasa software. Picasa will not uninstall other programs or add any non-Picasa programs or files to your computer.</blockquote></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

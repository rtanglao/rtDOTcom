## Pontifications

* I probably should have read [Modern Dive - An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R](http://moderndive.com) before I started with this "R, ggplot2 and tidyverse" malarkey :-) [And I might actually finish this book unlike what I blogged previously](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/08/04/p1-free-learning-modern-r-with-modern-data-tidying-packages-and-ggplot/)! It's short, sweet and very simply written (which is not easy!).
* Which would have required time travel since it didn't get published until Feb 2017 and then August 2, 2017 for the latest current version, 0.2.

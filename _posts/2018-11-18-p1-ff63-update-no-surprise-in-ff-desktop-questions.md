## Pontifications

* Updated [November 15, 2018 post and added Firefox 63](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/15/p1-no-surprise-in-ff-desktop-questions/). No surprises!
* It's surprising but not really surprising that folks hold onto Windows 7: they like the non Metro-ness of the interface and/or their hardware is old; and or many other long tail of reasons some of which are valid :-)
* In my bubble Windows 10 is far superior because of anti-virus and security mainly but hey I can see the reasons why others wouldn't agree!
* code for the following OS graphs:

  * [12november2018-gauge-plot-ff61.r](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kitsune-api/blob/master/VISUALIZATIONS/12november2018-gauge-plot-ff61.r) (not sure why it has soooo much white space)

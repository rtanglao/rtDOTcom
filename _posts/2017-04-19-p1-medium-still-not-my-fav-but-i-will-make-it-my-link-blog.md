title: Still don't like medium.com but I'll make it my link blog for rolandtanglao.com 
---

## Pontifications

* Medium still doesn't have a sustainable business model.
* Assuming the Medium API still works:
* 1\. I will move my medium stuff to medium.rolandtanglao.com
* 2\. I will create a ruby script to create a Medium blog post from a rolandtanglao.com post

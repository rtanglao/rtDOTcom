[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jul 28, 2021.Gordon Brander via [Boris](https://bmann.micro.blog/2021/07/23/more-than-other.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+bmannconsulting+%28Boris+Mann%27s+Blog+-+Future+of+web%2C+mobile+-+Vancouver%2C+startups%2C+open+source%29): [Aggregators aren't open-ended](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/aggregators-arent-open-ended) <--  links to this [tweet](https://twitter.com/tolmasky/status/1297200613403459586): `"But here’s the kicker: think of all the other amazing ideas that haven’t gotten a chance to be invented because they aren’t allowed on mobile devices. Mosaic happened less than 10 years after the Macintosh. We very well might have already had a browser-caliber invention by now."` 
and juicy quote: 
`"My sense is that, more than other networked software, tools for thought want to be owned. I don't want to store my second brain on someone else's computer. What if we instead had a small tool that was personal, multiplayer, distributed, evolvable? Maybe this is just a niche category, or maybe it could be the basis for a new open-ended ecosystem?"`

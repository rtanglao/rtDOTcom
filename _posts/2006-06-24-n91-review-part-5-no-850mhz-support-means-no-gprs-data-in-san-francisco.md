<p>
I don't know where I heard about this but the fact that the N91 (and the N70,  7610 and other phones without 850Mhz) doesn't support 850Mhz means that GPRS data doesn't work (although voice works fine!). Aaargh.  Interesting that it worked fine in San Jose at NetSquared; I guess data is not carried on 850Mhz in San Jose.

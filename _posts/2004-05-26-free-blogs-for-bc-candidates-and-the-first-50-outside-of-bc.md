From <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/26/76350.html">StreamLine :: Free blogs for BC candidates and the first 50 outside of BC</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>As I checked out the excellent BlogsCanada directory of Canadian Federal Election 2004 candidate websites yesterday looking for "real blogs" with RSS files for MPRating, I realized that the only way to get the candidates to blog would be to do something disruptive.

Here's our offer: free Blogware (hosted by Tucows, a fine Canadian company) blogs for all candidates in BC and to the first 50 candidates who apply from outside of BC.

Why blog? To have a conversation with your constituents rather than simply sending them the same old tired messages over and over again. Studies have shown that people who read blogs and leave comments are connectors and mavens and therefore influential.

Interested? Read <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/26/76350.html">the fine print</a> and then fill out our <a href="http://blogstore.streamlinewebco.com/">get a blog form</a>
OR
email roland AT streamlinewebco.com to apply.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/decline.txt) <- **QUOTE**: `A much more persuasive case for research, including relatively
unfettered one, can be made by citing extended research programs that
have only recently started to have an impact in the marketplace, but
are crucial today.  The Computing Research Association has compiled an
excellent report on just such developments [CRA].  It shows how a
decades-long collaboration of universities, government, and private
industry has provided the basic tools for the information society.
Broad programs, directed at areas that appear to be especially
promising or important, but ones that leave substantial freedom for
individual investigators, may be the most promising approach.  This
may not be exactly "the free play of free intellect" advocated by
Vannevar Bush, but it should be easier to justify to the public,
promote technological change, and advance human knowledge.  As
Langmuir is supposed to have said, "You can't predict what you will
find, but you can make sensible bets on where to look."`

## QUOTE

>By my count, there are three successful types of language model product:

>* Chatbots like ChatGPT, which are used by hundreds of millions of people for a huge variety of tasks
>* Completions coding products like Copilot or Cursor Tab, which are very niche but easy to get immediate value from
> * Agentic products like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Copilot Agent mode, which have only really started working in the last six months

>On top of that, there are two kinds of LLM-based product that don’t work yet but may soon:
>* LLM-generated feeds
>* Video games that are based on AI-generated content

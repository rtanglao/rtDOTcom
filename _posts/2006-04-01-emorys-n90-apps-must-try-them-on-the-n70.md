<p>In particular: <a href="http://www.shapeservices.com/eng/im/implus.php">IM+</a>. Is it better than <a href="http://www.agilemobile.com/agile_messenger.html">Agile Messenge</a>r?</p> <p>From <a href="http://kvet.ch/articles/2006/03/30/whats-on-my-n90">What&#39;s on my N90?</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>I&#39;ve been using a Nokia N90 S60 smartphone for almost a month now. I have the full unlocked 3G version from Europe, not the crippled cracked out one you can buy at Ritz Camera in exchange for a new contract with T-Mobile. </p>  <p>...</p> <p>Some of the built-in applications on the N90 are quite good. For example, the email client is fantastic. It supports IMAP, IMAP-IDLE, and email gets pushed to me as fast as my BlackBerry ever got it. I have no complaints there, really. The input device doesn&#39;t even bother me that much because a lot of my email when I&#39;m mobile is consumption anyway, and I rarely have to type out a huge edict or anything unless I&#39;m at a desk. Even the built-in browser is quite good. I have also installed Opera and Opera Mini but honestly I use the built-in browser most of the time. </p> <p>But like any smartphone user, I have managed to accumulate some favorite applications over the last month that I feel are very useful, so I&#39;ll be outlining them in this post. </p> <p>This post is a doozy. Get comfortable.</p></blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

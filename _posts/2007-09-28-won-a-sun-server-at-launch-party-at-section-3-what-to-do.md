<p>I had great fun at <a href="http://www.techvibes.com/events/event49801.html">Launch Party at Section 3</a> yesterday catching up with assorted techies and geeks but didn&#39;t have any time for the demos from <a href="http://lypp.com/">Lypp</a> et al.</p><p>&nbsp;And I won a Sun&nbsp; Server!!! Yay! What should I do with it? Thinking out loud:&nbsp; A 24 hour hackathon where techies and users build a website for a Vancouver based charity / non profit / cause? What do you think?

<p>I rode in the June 2008 Vancouver Critical Mass bike ride (<a href="http://www.sifttool.com/channel/vcmj08">check out my Mobile Muse Channel with pictures, videos and text</a> as well as <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/nts/workoutdetail/index.do?id=264339">my partial Nokia Sports Tracker map of the route</a> as well as f<a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=%22critical+mass%22+vancouver&amp;s=rec">lickr pictures</a> which I can&#39;t get into the Mobile Muse Channel since there&#39;s no RSS feed) and streamed video live using Qik from my Nokia N95, like I did for the <a href="http://www.sifttool.com/channel/cfvd08">Vancouver Car Free Festival.</a> Only this time I didn&#39;t use WiMax just Edge</p> <p>Some observations and comments:</p> <ol>   <li>The ride is quite the phenomenon. As a 3-5 days a week bicycle commuter; it was quite liberating to &quot;take over&quot; the streets and cycle with impunity (if you were in the middle, not so in the back) and be a 1st class citizen (for once!) on the road rather than feeling the need to maintain a constant vigil for cars not seeing you and running you over. Is this a form of civil disobedience or are we just <a href="http://www.joeydevilla.com/2006/09/29/critical-massholes-or-why-i-no-longer-ride-with-critical-mass/">Critical Massh*les</a>? To be honest, I fluctuate between both.</li>    <li>Lots of people taking digital photographs and using their cellphones and taking video but nobody doing this live. Imagine 5 years from now when everything is live!</li>    <li>My Io Gear power unit Nokia N Series power connector is flakey! Aaaargh, too late to return it too.</li>    <li>The N95 really isn&#39;t designed for streaming video live over a cellphone network from a bicycle. The S60 interface is designed to be used with one hand while standing still and the phone itself is not designed to be mounted on a bicycle. I would love for Nokia to build a mobile cellphone streaming device but realistically making my own with something like the Bug from <a href="/tags/bug-labs">Bug Labs</a> (hopefully I&#39;ll get mine soon) will (eventually) be the way to go</li> </ol><br />

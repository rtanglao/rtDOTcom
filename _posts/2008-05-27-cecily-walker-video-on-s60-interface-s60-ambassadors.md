<p>As part of my contribution to the <a href="http://www.s60.com/life/mys60/s60ambassadors">S60 Ambassadors</a> program, I&#39;m doing some videos of people&#39;s reactions to <a href="http://www.s60.com/">S60</a> and awareness of <a href="http://www.ovi.com/ovi/app/ovi/web/index/">Ovi</a>. Herewith <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cecily/2517356238/">my first 1:30 S60 Ambassadors video</a> with <a href="http://www.cecily.info/">Cecily Walker</a>, library and social media maven (recorded with her N82 at <a href="http://vidfest.com/">Vidfest</a>). - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cecily/2517356238/">Watch Cecily&#39;s S60 video</a> or check out my transcript below!</p> <p>Positives:</p> <ol>   <li>absolutely loves it</li>    <li>changes the way Cecily views media, &quot;all in one package&quot; she can post audio and video immediately via Bluetooth or WiFi</li>    <li>really pretty</li>    <li>paid with N82 with her own money! (off Craigslist since not officially available in Canada, aaargh!)</li> </ol> <p>S60 Not so Positive</p> <ol>   <li>S60 &quot;really really buggy&quot; things quitting without error message</li>    <li>Never heard of OVI (unfortunately most people in Canada haven&#39;t but that&#39;s not surprising given Canada&#39;s lack of awareness on these issues and Nokia&#39;s lack of marketing)</li> </ol>

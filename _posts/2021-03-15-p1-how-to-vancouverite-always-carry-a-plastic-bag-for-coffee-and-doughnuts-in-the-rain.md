title: "How To Vancouverite in the Rain: Always carry a plastic bag for outdoor coffee and doughnuts in the rain"
---
* Juste pour le fun :-)
* Always carry a plastic bag so you can have your coffee in the rain.
* Seriously it's not that bad, there's always some sort of rain shelter somewhere and if you are wearing appropriate rain gear and your back side is dry courtesy of the plastic bag, it's fun to drink your coffee and eat your doughnut in the rain! And in COVID times there's the bonus advantage of nobody else doing it :-) !

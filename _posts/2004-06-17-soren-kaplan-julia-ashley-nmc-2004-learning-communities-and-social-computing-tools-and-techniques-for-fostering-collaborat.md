-70% of learning is informal
-learning is deeper if it is collaborative
- deeper learning
--requires ownership
--requires context
--social-learning communities bridge content and context by encouraging focused social interactions that elicit new knowledge and that connect learning to practical experience and action
-task oriented community is different than a learning community
-enablers for truly collaborative learning
--pre-learning, pre-thinking (doing due diligence, come prepared)
--forming, storming, norming, performing
--technology and dialog -need to let go of control to allow students to participate and even critique at any time
--having a common purpose/goal/mission enables people to be active rather than passive
Continuum of collaborative Communities
-Affinity/Affiliation -like NMC
-task oriented around projects
-in between community of practice - advancing for a professional community
-learning community - for a group and individuals
Examples
I. Rider
-25% of science and math teachers give up teaching after 2 years
-not trained for 30 parent teacher conferences after 2  months! NOT trained for this
-Rider created a virtual learning community/community of practice to combat this
--created shared virtual space to create sense of belonging and connection that enables people to share knowledge and best practices 
2. Business as an agent of World Benefit (missed the real definition of BAWP)
- find business models worldwide that lead to world benefit
- created an event to drive participation
-did international virtual online conference
-10 year effort
-800 registrants from 50 countries!
-ahead of time, put stories and best practices on the iCohere tool
-showcased CEO of green mountain coffee to show different support to provide value
-created online presentation, anybody can view and discuss it
10 steps to commnunity

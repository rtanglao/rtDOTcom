## Pontifications

* On last Friday's [over 40 in Vancouver](https://audioboom.com/over40invan), Dale and I talked about twitter:<br />

* What should twitter do?
* In my opinion it should simply go out of business :-) (no disrespect meant to the fine employees and folks of twitter but that looks to be where this ends because of the Silicon Valley religion of endless growth!) but before it does:
    * a non profit not Mozilla should clone the twitter API and have an easy import tool into its non-profit version of twitter
    * and move the users!
* I know this won't happen but one can dream eh :-) ?

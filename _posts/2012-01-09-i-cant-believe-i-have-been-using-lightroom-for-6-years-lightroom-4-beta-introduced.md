<p>(<a href="http://www.chuqui.com/2012/01/lightroom-4-beta-released/">Via Chuq, Lightroom 4 is out on the eve of the 6th anniversary of Lightroom beta 1 back in 2006</a>!!) I have been using Lightroom since Beta 1 six years ago (and I love Lightroom but really don't like any other Adobe software!)! Time to up my game. Re-learn Lightroom 4 (it seems to be have lots of great radical changes in the develop module so my Develop Module workflow which is almost automatic so much so that I don't consciously think about it is now obsolete!) AND shoot more JPEGs (or at least tweak my Fuji X10 settngs to get the most out of RAW + JPEG and just post the JPEGs if they are good enough)</p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 16, 2021. Stratechery:[Moderation in Infrastructure](https://stratechery.com/2021/moderation-in-infrastructure/) "This power came to the fore in early January 2021, when first Facebook, and then Twitter, suspended/banned the sitting President of the United States from their respective platforms. It was a decision I argued for; from Tr*mp and Twitter:" and  "public clouds in particular would be better off preparing for geographically-distinct policies in the long run, even as they deliver on their commitment to predictability and process in the meantime, with a strong bias towards being hands-off. That will mean some difficult decisions, which is why itâ€™s better to make a commitment to neutrality and due process now."  Where is the "line in the stack"?

## Pontifications

* Google to demand regular Android security patches from OEMs:[via the fabulous vowe.net: Dave Kleidermacher who leads mobile security at Google:"...this will really lead to a massive increase in the number of devices, and users, receiving regular security patches"](https://vowe.net/archives/017137.html) 
* Oh really, how massive? all OEMs that use Google Play? 50% 75%, 100%, of the OEMs?
* By when? 2020, 2021, end of 2019?
* I want to believe :-) but I don't. I'll believe it when S*msung agrees to this. Until then Android is one massive security headache except for Pixel devices.

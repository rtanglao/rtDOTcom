* [om: Productivity: what is it good for](https://om.co/2020/05/07/productivity-what-is-it-good-for/)? Me: Absolutely nothing. Being kind and useful and creative and helping the world move forward is much better
  * The reference of course is to the great [War song from Edwin Starr from 1969 (youtube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01-2pNCZiNk)

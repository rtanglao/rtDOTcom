I bet this is exactly what Google is building.  We live in very interesting times.

From <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=1524b97e-f8b1-4e42-ac07-455337f299b4">What is Google Building? - Dare Obasanjo</a>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>A friend of mine, Justin, had an interesting idea at dinner yesterday. What if Google ends up building the network computer? They can give users the storage space and reliability to run place all their data online. They can mimic the major desktop applications users interact with daily by using Web technologies. This sounds far fetched but then again, I'd have never imagined I'd see a free email service that gave 1GB of free email.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

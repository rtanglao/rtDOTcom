Go <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> and <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/">RCS</a> go!

<p>From <a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2005/05/18/redesign">Just a Gwai Lo Redesigned by Raincity Studios</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Some first reactions by those who saw comps were, shall we say, not enthusiastic. They loved how it looked, but didn%u2019t think it matched either my gender or personality. ("Are you a girl?" is still my favourite reaction.) They're probably right: the design is very pink and flowery, but I wanted something that I can stare at that wasn't manly, so the other direction seemed right. After a couple of weeks with the design public, it still feels right.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

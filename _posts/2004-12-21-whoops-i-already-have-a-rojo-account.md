<p>After <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/12/20/flickr_is_a_social_photo_blogging_service_invented_from_the_outside_in">whingeing :-) about not getting an invitation to Rojo</a>, <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc</a> pointed out that I already do have a Rojo account that he invited me to previously! D'oh! Mea culpa, etc.
</p>	
<p>I don't see how <a href="http://rojo.com/">Rojo</a> is better than <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> (unless you can convince your peers to join and share what they are paying attention to which I can't but maybe <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Gillmor/">Steve</a> has), but perhaps Steve can clarify that in a future post.</p>

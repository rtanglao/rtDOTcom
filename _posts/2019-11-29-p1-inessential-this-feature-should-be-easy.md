* Avoid the word easy when it comes to features (or [documentation](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/11/28/p1-howto-remove-condesceding-language-from-documentation/)) <--- tl;dr from I[nessential: This Feature Should Be Easy](https://inessential.com/2019/11/03/this_feature_should_be_easy)
* Nothing is easy! Please continue to report bugs and ask for feature requests, just don't use the words `easy` or `should`!

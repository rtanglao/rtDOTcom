<p><a href="http://web.me.com/jamesburland/Nokia_Creative/Blog/Blog.html">James Burland</a>'s (a video and still cameraphone expert since the N90 and N93 days))&nbsp;&nbsp;stunning video of a bee pollinating flowers shows the high quality sound and video of the iPhone 4 camera.</p><p><strong>Total killer app for parents and aspiring film makers !!</strong>&nbsp;Who needs a Canon 5D Mark II? You could easily do something like the Blair Witch Project with&nbsp;shaky&nbsp;non stabilized video on the iPhone 4.</p><p>Don't believe me? Register for vimeo, download <a href="http://vimeo.com/12821025">James Burland's iphone 4 HD video,</a> put on your headphones and check it out.</p><p>Because I have tried an N8&nbsp;prototype, I know the Nokia N8's stills are better than the iPhone 4 stills but not sure the N8's videos are going to be better than iPhone 4. Bring on the competition!</p>

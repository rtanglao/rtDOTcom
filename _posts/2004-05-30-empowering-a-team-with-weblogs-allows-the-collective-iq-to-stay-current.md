Wow! Words to live by!

From <a href="http://www.willpate.org/archives/2004/05/25/blogging-paths-in-the-grass.php">Blogging Paths in the Grass :. WillPate.org</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>In an organization blogs can operate much the same way. They become open spaces where people can create their own path. Discussions emerge and the lines wear deeper into the solid ground, creating meaningful relationships built on common interests.

We're bombarded with marketing ballyhoo about how technology is redefining not just how we work, but actually speeding up the pace of change itself. It is, and has reached a point well beyond any leader's ability to stay on top of it all. Just as delegating responsibilty ensures the smooth operation of an organization, empowering a team with weblogs allows the collective IQ to stay current.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

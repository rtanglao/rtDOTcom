<p>Great term, &quot;Resentment-based Pricing&quot;!  </p><p>From <a href="http://disruptivewireless.blogspot.com/2006/04/value-based-pricing-no-i-dont-think-so.html">Dean Bubley&#39;s Disruptive Wireless: Value-based pricing? No, I don&#39;t think so.</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Resentment-based pricing - you know you&#39;re being ripped off hugely, but you &quot;have&quot; to pay as you have no immediate alternative. You grit your teeth, and (hopefully) expense it afterwards. You actively look for a way to avoid the cost, and minimise your usage. You complain to friends &amp; colleagues. You develop &quot;active customer disloyalty&quot; and vow to switch suppliers, out of distaste for their show of customer disrespect, whenever you can. Examples: Hotel WiFi, cellular data roaming.</p></blockquote><p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

title: "Microsoft Surface Book 2 Meets all the requirements and doesn't have WiFi driver issues"

## Pontifications

* [When I posted about Windows laptops recently](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/18/p1-windows-laptop-touch-screen-16gb-ram-usb-c-power/), I didn't realize that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 meets all the requirements (and doesn't have WiFi driver issues unlike Dell XPS 13 and Lenovo and all the others). Unlike the previous generation, it has USB-C power (not to mention a touch screen).
* Since I hate Windows drivers stuff (what is this the 1990s :-) ?!?), I think assuming work will pay the $ that the Surface Book 2's currently the front runner.
* If Microsoft can't get the drivers right for their own hardware, there's no hope for Windows :-) !

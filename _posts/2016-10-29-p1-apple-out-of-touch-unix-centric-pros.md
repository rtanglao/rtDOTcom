title: Apple is out of touch with Unix-centric pros! Solution -- our own laptops, our own software
---
## Pontifications

* [Rui is absolutely right, Apple is out of touch with Unix-centric pros](http://taoofmac.com/space/links/2016/10/27/1959) (and I'm one of them having used Unix since what 1984?). However I don't think another out of touch vendor like Lenovo or MS's surface stuff is the solution. The solution is to build our own laptops (maybe based on Lenovo hardware with more open stuff more unlocked stuff we can hack) running our own software (Ubuntu / Debian) that's usable, power efficient, light etc.
* I don't have the energy for this so I'll keep buying Macs until somebody else does :-)

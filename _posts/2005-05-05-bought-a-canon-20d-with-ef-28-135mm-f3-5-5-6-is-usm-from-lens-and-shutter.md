<p>In the spirit of spending my tax rebate before I get it :-) , I bought a Canon 20D with an <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=149&amp;modelid=7337">EF 28-135mm f3.5-5.6 IS USM lens</a> from <a href="http://lensandshutter.com/">Lens and Shutter</a>. Talk to Howard over at Lens and Shutter at <a href="http://lensandshutter.com/locations.lasso?location=Pacific_Centre">Pacific Centre</a>. He's a nice guy, knowledgeable and can give you a good deal!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://kriskrug.com/">KK</a>, got a great deal including a 2 Gig memory card and an extra battery.
</p>

<p>What will I use it for? Better kid pictures and better <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/04/29/is_the_canon_20d_camera_the_only_prosumer_digital_slr_with_iso_3200">flash-less</a> pictures for <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/">Urban Vancouver</a> and <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/">VanEats</a>!</p>

<p>I will be blogging my experiences with the camera as I learn about it over on <a href="http://photographyhack.com/">photographyhack</a>!</p>

<p>I'd really like to go to <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampTdot">BarCamp TDot</a> and the <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/">Mesh Conference</a> in Toronto since I could slip in a visit to my brother and his family as well as learn lots and meet some very smart people from the rest of Canada (since most of the people I know in Web 2.0 are on the West Coast of North America) who get things done in the Web 2.0 space.</p>  <p>BarCamp TDot is more my style (and the organizers think :-) I am coming because I sort of suggested it in my <a href="/rt/archives/2006/03/09/canadacamp-before-or-after-toronto-web-2-0-traditional-conference">CanadaCamp</a> post) so I am trying to see if I can find a way for me to go to BarCAmp TDot (and money permitting the Mesh Conference) that makes sense to my family and Bryght.   </p> <p>While I love &quot;normal&quot; conferences (and <a href="http://gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a> is definitely one of the best and hopefully I will be there this year again as well!), I personally get more out of unconferences like <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">Moosecamp</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a> (to gratuitously name drop the unconferences I have helped organize).</p> <p> Net net as they say, Mesh has lots of great people so I am sure it will turn out great regardless of what myself and  <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/web-2-0-mesh-conference-in-toronto-announced-may-15th-16th">Boris pontificate</a> online about it :-) !</p>

title: "Everybody who writes formulas and/or uses pivot tables in a spreadsheet is a programmer"

## Pontifications

* Your yearly reminder: Everybody who writes formulas and/or uses pivot tables in a spreadsheet is a programmer :-) 
* Check out [Spreadsheet developers are "real" developers too from 2017 :-)](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/26/p1-spreadsheet-developers-are-real-developers-too/)
* Now I'll add something new in 2018, we in the software business should give them better tools that somehow adds versioning and puts their spreadsheets on their internet, heck I'll go crazy and say we should find a way to let them automatically test their spreadsheets too!
* What I'm proposing doesn't have to look like a spreadsheet, it just has to be as easy to use for 1st timers!

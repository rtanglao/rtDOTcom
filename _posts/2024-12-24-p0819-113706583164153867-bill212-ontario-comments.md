This means you can use SQL to make queries if that's your jam. Hope it's helpful!](https://devdilettante.com/@roland/113706583164153867) <--Run your SQL queries (no SQL knowledge needed, just play around :-) and if you need to know more there are plenty of learning SQL resources on the internet) by going to [this lite.datasette.io URL with the CSV pre-loaded](https://lite.datasette.io/?csv=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Frtanglao%2Fbill-212-fun%2Fmain%2F2024-12-23-ontario-bill-212-anti-bicycle-bill.csv). This means you can search for words, visualize it without running code, just by using lite.datasette.io or any the 1000s of CSV tools that will load the CSV which is at: [github rtanglao bill-212-fun 2024-12-23-ontario-bill-212-anti-bicycle-bill.csv](https://github.com/rtanglao/bill-212-fun/blob/main/2024-12-23-ontario-bill-212-anti-bicycle-bill.csv`)

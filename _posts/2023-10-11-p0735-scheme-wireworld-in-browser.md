[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 11, 2023 07:35  [Scheme in the browser: A Hoot of a tale -- Spritely Institute](https://spritely.institute/news/scheme-wireworld-in-browser.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `If youâ€™d like to compile and run this yourself, check out our GitLab repo for this demo. Like most of our projects, it uses Guix to setup the development environment. The environment requires an unreleased version of Guile compiled from source, so be prepared to wait awhile for it to build.` <-- super cool!

* MirNs at the [New Media Gallery in New Westministe](https://newmediagallery.ca/)r! Highly recommended if you can get a 1 hour slot, extended until  01August20

* Artistic Statement from the website (not sure it will be up past August 1st so I am copying it here)

  * "*All sorts of things in this world behave like mirrors          (Lacan)* 

     This exhibition emerged from a rich period of enquiry around equity and  diversity.  The question was raised, how or can a diverse audience  actually be reflected through technology-based works in the contested  space of an art gallery?  This interactive exhibition was put together  as a way to explore how machines literally reflect, interpret and ‘see’ a diversity of visitors to the gallery.  Human interaction with the works further reveals how we perceive and interpret the actions, behaviour  and output of these mirroring machines.   In this liminal space, a  multiplicity of ephemeral portraits and self-portraits are generated and flow; saved to machinic and biologic memory.  Through interactive  robotics, neural networks, algorithms, coding, artificial intelligence,  micro controllers, proximity & motion sensors and facial recognition these mirroring machines reflect and expose human diversity in a world  of technology.    MirNs refers to Mirror Neurons, of intense interest in biology,  psychology and physiology as well as robotics, AI, and coding.   Scientists theorize that the mirroring nature of MirNs generate  imitative behaviours, resulting in empathy and the capability for  aesthetic experience.  It has been stated that Mirror Neurons are  responsible for making us human. 

     The question of what will continue to hold value in a world of  technology is becoming increasingly important. The reflection of what is human remains an exemplar…but is that changing?  As the boundaries  between biology and technology become more and more blurred how will the reflection of what is human change the world we live in?  How will  humanity be reflected in the future?  .   

     Suitable for All Ages. "

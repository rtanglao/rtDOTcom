* [From The Cambridge Analytica Files ‘I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool’: meet the data war whistleblower](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump) :

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

Millions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments? <br /><br />

It occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.<br /><br />

“Yes.”<br /><br />

Nato or non-Nato?<br /><br />

“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”<br /><br />

It’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.<br /><br />

* Possible ways to fight his but probably not going to happen
    * Strong, benovlent, incorruptible regulation
    * Make everybody aware of the enlightment and learn about history, philosophy and ethics

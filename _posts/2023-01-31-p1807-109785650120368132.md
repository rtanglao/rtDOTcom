David Laborde, Livia Bizikova, Tess Lallemant and Carin Smaller](https://www.iisd.org/system/files/publications/ending-hunger-what-would-it-cost.pdf)--> QUOTE: `The world has committed to ending hunger by 2030. Meeting that goal would mark a monumental turning point in human history. Our model has made clear that with improved targeting, this goal is both achievable and affordable. We found that it will cost on average an extra USD 11 billion per year of public spending from now to 2030. USD 4 billion of the additional spending needs to come from donors. The remaining USD 7 billion will come from the targeted countries themselves.`

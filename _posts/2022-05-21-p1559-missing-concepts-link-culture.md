[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): May 21, 2022 15:59  [missing concepts in link culture? ¦ maya.land](https://maya.land/monologues/2022/05/20/missing-concepts-link-culture.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `The tech we’re working with wasn’t meant to let us e.g. link to a certain version in history of a page6, and I’ve run across people acting like it’s therefore rude to change and move content – someone might have been trying to link to that! This seems unnecessarily stifling. I want us all to think more creatively about updates and feeds and non-chronological presentation and how it all fits together, because I don’t believe we’re done experimenting with this here world wide web.`

Ross nails it.  Watch for an explosion of creative energy from the prudent, penny pinching firms that survived the downturn.

From <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2004/04/making_do_with_.html#comments">Ross Mayfield's Weblog: Making Do With Less Stays With You</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>But more to the point, the best companies arise out of downturn (think Apple, Microsoft, etc.). Frugality, understanding risk and smart investment decisions remain embedded in decision makers and the culture of the company. The hardest lessons stay with you.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

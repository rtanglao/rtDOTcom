```plaintext
Clerk is a notebook library for Clojure that aims to address these problems by 
doing less, namely:

no editing environment, folks can keep using the editors they know and 
love

no new format: Clerk notebooks are regular Clojure namespaces (
interspersed with markdown comments). This also means Clerk 
notebooks are meant to be stored in source control.

no out-of-order execution: Clerk notebooks always evaluate from 
top to bottom. Clerk builds a dependency graph of Clojure vars and only 
recomputes the needed changes to keep the feedback loop fast.

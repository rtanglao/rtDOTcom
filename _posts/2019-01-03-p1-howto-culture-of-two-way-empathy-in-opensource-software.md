# Pontifications

* withoutboats wrote a fantastic article about [organizational debt](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/) which applies to SUMO too just like [Jan 1, 2019's post: Aaron Turon:Thank-you for these terms: 'Critique Gauntlet, Groundhog Day, & Stochastic Criticism': We face them every day on the SUMO forums indeed any user feedback forum for any popular open source project!](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/01/01/p1-aaron-turon-critique-gauntlet-groundhog-day-stochastic-critique/).
* Juicy quote, [read the whole thing](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/).

**QUOTE**

<blockquote> 
    
But what is so exhausting for me personally is that there is so often not a reciprocity of empathy from the other side of the discussion. Frankly, what I experience often is a startling lack of professionalism from community members, a standard of conduct which - while not below the bare minimum of appropriate behavior set by our Code of Conduct - I cannot imagine would be acceptable as a manner of communication to a colleague in a workplace.

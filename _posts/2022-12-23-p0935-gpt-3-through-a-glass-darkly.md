```
GPT-3

    Extends each voice & mimics creativity
    Obsolesces copy-writing and essays so that human insight becomes a luxury
    Retrieves the polymaths of the European Renaissance so that the best writers must be multi-talented to earn a living
    Reverses into mass deception and provides answers without real questions behind themsee quote below

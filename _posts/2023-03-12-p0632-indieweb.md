[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 12, 2023 06:32 [On POSSE and IndieWeb ¦ Joel Auterson](https://www.joelotter.com/posts/2023/03/indieweb/) <-- I need to start using `brid.gy` --> QUOTE: `To get this working I use a service called brid.gy, which is amazing - essentially it parses your website and works out how to format a tweet or toot. It can also do what’s called “backfeeding”, which we’ll look at in a minute....brid.gy has really good and comprehensive docs which I recommend. My flow for publishing something now goes like this: 1. Post it on my website 2. Wait for it to go online via GitHub Pages 3. Tell brid.gy about the post, and it’ll publish it to Twitter and Mastodon for me.... 4. Update the post with the Twitter and Mastodon links.`

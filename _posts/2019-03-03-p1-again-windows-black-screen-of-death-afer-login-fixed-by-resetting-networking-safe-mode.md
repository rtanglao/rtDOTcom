title: "Again! Weird Windows 10 Black Screen of Death after signin fixed by resetting network in Windows 10 safe mode"

# Pontifications

* Again ([last time was Friday](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/01/windows-black-screen-of-death-afer-login-fixed-by-resetting-networking-safe-mode/)) Weird! Never seen anything like this on Mac.
* Again, this is unexpected because I assumed these sorts of (wifi driver related?) shenanigans wouldn't happen since Microsoft makes the computer and the OS.

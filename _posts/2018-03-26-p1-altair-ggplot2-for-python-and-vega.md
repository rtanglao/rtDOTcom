## Pontifications
 
 * Altair is ggplot2 for python and vega? Yes please!
 * Check out [Jim Vallandingham's An Introduction to Altair](http://vallandingham.me/altair_intro.html), juicy quote:
 
 **QUOTE**
 
 <blockquote>
 
 Recently I attended a wonderful talk by Jake VanderPlas (and hosted by the always astute Eli Bressert) about a wonderful package he has been working on to make visualization in python easier.

As a long time ggplot2 user, I’m quick to bemoan the challenges of succinctly visualizing data in python. While there are many visualization packages out there, none of them seem to approach the intuitiveness, completeness, and consistency found in R’s go-to tooling.

I’m happy to say that this new python package Altair might put an end to my grumblings (and yours) once and for all.

* Absolutely adore the [New Westminster New Media Gallery](http://newmediagallery.ca/) and their exhibits. It's free! Worth the Skytrain trip! Highly recommended!

* Current exhibition on until September 29, 2019. It is truly amazing and is entitled "winds"

* From their website:

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

"Landscape and weather have long shared an intimate connection with the arts.  Each of the works here is a landscape: captured, interpreted and presented through a range of technologies. The four artists in this exhibition have taken, as their material process, the movement of wind through physical space & time. They explore how our perception and understanding of landscape can be interpreted through technology. <br /><br />

These works have been created by what might be understood as a sort of scientific method or process that involves collecting data, acute observation, controlled experiments and the incorporation of measurements and technologies that control or collect motion, pressure, sound, pattern and the like. The artists then take us in other directions; allowing technology or situations to render visible that which is invisible, creating and focussing on peculiar or resonant qualities of sound, light or movement in ways that seem to influence emotion or memory, dwelling on iconic places and events, or revealing in subtle ways, the subjective nature of time.  Each of these works suggest questions related to the nature of illusive experience and how or if it can be captured, bringing inevitable connections to authorship, loss, memory and memento mori.

* The above words are great but they don't do the exhibit justice! Go see it!

## Pontifications

 *  From [Stephen Downes: Consciousness](https://halfanhour.blogspot.ca/2017/11/consciousness.html):

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

For me, the lesson I draw, is that life is everything. This applies to my own life, of course, but I also extend the same feeling to those around me, whose existence I can only comprehend through science and culture, but whose dilemma I assume is the same as mine, that is, that it is the quality (and duration, and variety, and related properties) of their experience that overwhelms everything else.

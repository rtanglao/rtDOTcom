title: "Potential TensorFlow project: Use Human in the loop to train on 50 or less Firefox for Android Google Play Store reviews for positive and negative sentiment and keyword extraction?!?"

## Pontifications
* I think sentiment is definitely doable with [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) 
* Not sure about keyword extraction, it might just be word clustering?!?
* How many reviews would have to be randomly sampled? Maybe 50 per month in English?
* Can do this in German and other languages, right?

* Stephen Downes:[On the Indieweb](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2021/02/on-indieweb.html)  <-- "you shouldn't have to pay for it. You should be able to run the whole thing off your own computer if you want, without having to pay hosting costs to some online service, and you should be able to do so with a minimum of installation and configuration" <--- AMEN folks should be able to publish their stuff without worrying about paying for "hosting" and "servers"!

title: Running N95-1 Firmware V21 and ShoZu 4.0 but can't update Facebook Status

<p>So far so good. The only bug I can see is that I can&#39;t seem to update my Facebook status from <a href="http://shozu.vox.com/library/post/shozu-40-has-landed.html">ShoZu 4.0</a>. Everything else works (e.g. I can see the last few status updates from my 341 ShoZu &quot;friends&quot;). I am sure the ShoZu folks will make it work pretty quickly; it&#39;ll be cool to use my unlimited EDGE for updating my Facebook status for free (rather than SMS which would cost me $).</p>

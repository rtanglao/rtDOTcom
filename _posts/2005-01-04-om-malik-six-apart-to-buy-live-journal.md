<p>Amazing! 2005! The year blogs, RSS and dynamic, easy to use web publishing become truly mainstream begins with a bang.
</p><p>From <a href="http://gigaom.com/2005/01/04/six-apart-to-buy-live-journal/">Six Apart to buy Live Journal</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>EXCLUSIVE: Folks have been predicting a big year for mergers and acquisitions in 2005, and we are starting the year with a bang. I have learnt exclusively that Six Apart, the parent company behind hosted blogging service TypePad, and Moveable Type is about to acquire Live Journal, for an undisclosed amount. The deal is a mix of stock and cash, and could be announced sometime later this month, according to those close to the two companies. If the deal goes through, then Six Apart will become one of the largest weblog companies in the world, with nearly 6.5 million users. It also gives the company a very fighting chance against Google's Blogger and Microsoft's MSN Spaces.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

## Pontifications

* Dave had a great idea: [an app to automatically commit this blog to git and upload to github daily](http://scripting.com/2017/11/26.html#a141824)!
* If we had a github post commit hook that ran jekyll  in the cloud and then uploaded to surge.sh again in the cloud perhaps using heroku we'd then wouldn't need a computer with jekyll and ruby installed, just a phone or anything that runs a web browser so we could update this blog from everywhere! I've tried heroku in the past but I've found it clunky and I don't trust their free plan to stick around forever! (and as always I need to re-try heroku again, maybe it's less clunky now?)

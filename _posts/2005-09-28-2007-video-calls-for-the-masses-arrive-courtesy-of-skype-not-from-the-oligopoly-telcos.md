<p>There you have it! Skype introduces video calling in November 2005 for Windows. So Mac and Linux Skype video calling will be there in 2006 which means 2007 is the year of video calling for the masses. By the time video calling goes mainstream, "the locked in the trunk users" of Apple's awesome iSight/MacOSX/iChatAV trio will have been happily connecting with family and making more money off of the richness of decent video calling for over 2 years. Another reason to pay the Mac tax: cool things like iChatAV today point to the future for the mainstream in 2-3 years. </p>

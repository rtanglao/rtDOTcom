<p>Traditional doesn't mean bad though (and props to <a href="http://evans.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2006/3/2/1791774.html">Mark Evans</a>, <a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/index.php/2006/03/02/well-weve-got-the-barn/">Matthew Ingram</a>, <a href="http://www.michaelmcderment.com/article/Conference-Update-1.html">Michael McDerment</a>, and <a href="http://stuartmacdonald.ca/">Stuart MacDonald</a> for taking the time to organize this; I know how hard this is to do in 12 months like we do for <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a> let alone 3 months like they are doing). I really enjoyed the "traditional"  part of the Northern Voice blogging conference (why? just two of many reasons: <a href="http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/onfacblog.htm">Nancy White</a> and <a href="http://julieleung.com/">Julie Leung</a>)  in Vancouver both in 2005 and in 2006. But I gotta admit, after helping organize unconferences like <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/moosecamp">Northern Voice Moosecamp 2006</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a>, as well as more traditional conferences like Northern Voice and the <a href="http://oscms-summit.org/">Open Source Content Management System and Blog Tool Summit</a>, my sympathies are with the unconferences.</p>  <p>A plea for somebody in Toronto: organize a Bar Camp Toronto (should be easy given the success of <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCamp">TorCamp</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/TorCampDemoCamp4">DemoCamp4</a>, maybe call it CanadaCamp and encourage people from Vancouver and the East Coast to converge in Toronto; I wish I had time to help organize this but other than throwing out crazy ideas I don't!) before or after the Toronto Web 2.0 conference at a place with lots of rooms, central location and good WiFi and convince some West Coast people like the following to lead sessions (the following short list off the top of my head shows omits many cool folks apologies in advance):</p>  <ul><li><a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris Mann</a> - one  my Bryght partners - could lead sessions on starting and running an open source company, open source product development and evangelism since he is Drupal evangelist #1 in my book. Boris could also be a session leader on Jabber, VoIP and web application platforms.</li> <li><a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi Bryant</a> and <a href="http://smallthought.com/andrew/">Andrew Catton</a> of <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a> could lead a session on Smalltalk and why it's relevant to Web 2.0 as well as why doing things differently makes sense</li> <li><a href="http://www.sifry.com/alerts/">Dave Sifry</a> (not a Vancouverite person yay!) could do a leadership "hack" session - the one at Moosecamp was fantastic from what I could tell </li><li><a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul Kedrosky</a> (a sometime Vancouverite) could talk about <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001959.html">On why you may not need Venture Capital for your startup</a>, just do it with your own money!</li> <li><a href="http://alexandrasamuel.com/">Alexandra Samuel</a> on what tech companies can learn from non profits and activist organizations. </li><li><a href="http://blame.ca/dick/">Dick Hardt</a> or one of his <a href="http://sxip.com/">sxip</a> folks could lead a session on <a href="http://www.identity20.com/">Identity 2.0</a> what it is, why we need it. Dick also knows a tonne about running <a href="http://activestate.com/">an open source startup</a>!</li></ul>     <p>From <a href="http://stuartmacdonald.ca/">Stuart MacDonald | eBusiness and Marketing Geek</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote><p>Our Web 2.0 Toronto Conference date and location are set. Mark May 8 and 9, 2006 at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto in your calendar. The keynotes and panels are shaping up nicely, and we will have a site up by mid-March with all the details.</p> </blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

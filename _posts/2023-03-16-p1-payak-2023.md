title: "Payak 2023: I thought I was fastest evah but I wasn't. The cold (-8) and unwisely stopping just before the end for a drink (oops) made me slower"

* Payak [2023](https://zone4.ca/race/2023-02-25/3118c178/results) on February 25, 2023 (skate)
* First time IRL since February 2020!
* It was cold but felt fast. The cold did slow me down, excuses excuses :-)
* Nice snow! Super fun!
* I only fell once and this was because somebody hit me from behind going downhill but I guess in retrospet I should haven't done such a wide turn (dynamic "lalas" :-) as my old downhill ski instructor in Ottawa told me at Camp Fortune)

title: Snowmaggedon Day 33 City of Vancouver miscommunication continues aka blog updates daily
---

## Pontifications

* I'm a Vision supporter. There is no better alternative. All the rest of the Vancouver politicians want to slow down bicycle paths and greenification when I would say double down on transit, walking, bicycle paths and greenification.
* But Vision's deafening silence on everything sucks.
* Especially Snowmaggedon
* I suggest hiring an intern for $ to blog **daily** about the snowmaggedon and keep blogging after it's over with a full-time employee. The city web site is ridiculously bad. Probably because it's a static CMS from the 1990s :-) would be my guess.
Twitter would suffice but c'mon just buy a wordpress blog for $100 US a year (to get a custom subdomain and no ads!)

title: "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:: Even semantics have conspired to make that which is black seem ugly and degrading. In Roget’s Thesaurus, there are some 120 synonyms for 'blackness' and at least sixty of them are offensive, such words as blot, soot, grim, devil, and foul. And there are some 134 synonyms for 'whiteness' and all are favorable, expressed in such words as purity, cleanliness, chastity, and innocence <- 'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?', 1967."

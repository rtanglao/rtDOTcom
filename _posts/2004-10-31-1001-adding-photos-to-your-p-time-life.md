<a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a> is excellent.  You rock, Adriaan! Thanks!

1001 adds photos to your polychronic time i.e. <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/06/going_ptime.html">P-Time</a> life.  I love it! But of course it's yet another distraction that you need to switch off if you are trying to focus and live in M-time. My P-Time consists of IM, email, wiki and blogs (and occasionally IRC).

1001 is also an excellent example of why APIs like the ones that Flickr provides are needed. The web app (and the web browser) are your best friend and worst enemy.  They are your best friend because they enable anybody to use it.  They are your worst enemy because the back button s*cks and all the conveniences, affordancies and speed of a desktop are absent.  APIs give you the best of both possible worlds: the table stakes web app and the the cool desktop apps.

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 6, 2023 09:40  [Is Tr*mp’s "Brave New World" Coming Soon?](https://hartmannreport.com/p/is-trumps-brave-new-world-coming-ed5) <- I hope this fictionalized Tr*mp dystopia doesn't come to pass in any year let alone 2024 or 2025 --> **QUOTE**: `I’ve been following the news as best I can, and it appears that the initial news reports from January detailing the thousands of people killed and injured by police in the nationwide demonstrations have largely vanished. One of the guards who has access to the internet says all the stories have been scrubbed: it’s as if it never happened.` <- Check back in 2025 I guess!

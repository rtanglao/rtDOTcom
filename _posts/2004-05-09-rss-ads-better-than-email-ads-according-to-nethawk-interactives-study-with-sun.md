Hmmm!

From <a href="http://www.pheedo.info/archives/000057.html">Pheedo - Maximizing the Value of Weblog Advertising</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Nethawk Interactive reports that by integrating online advertising into an RSS feed, a new online advertising technique, it has achieved measurably better results than e-mail for its client Suntone, a division of Sun Microsystems.

The online campaign for a free IT evaluation was conducted through specialist publication InfoWorld, which could offer direct access to IT professionals.

The marketer said the six-week effort outperformed the best click through rate in email by over 26% as compared to the industry average of 8.7% CTR reported in DoubleClick&#8217;s Q4 2003 Email Trend Report. Furthermore, they were able to lower the effective CPM by three times of that over email, saving Suntone&#8217;s thousands of dollars</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

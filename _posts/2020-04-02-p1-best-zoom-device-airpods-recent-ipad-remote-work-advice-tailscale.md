* Read the whole thing to learn about Notion, Keybase, Streak CRM, slack etc in addition to useful advice about videconferencing with Zoom and other products: [Several grumpy opinions about remote work at Tailscale](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20200309) and or check out these quotes:
* "The very latest 2019 iPad Pro  has a pretty great front-facing camera that works in low light (the best  kind of light), so that's what I use now."
* "Airpods (when connected to iPhones or iPads) have very low latency, not  detectable by humans."
* "I mounted my iPad above my monitor, at the so-called "selfie angle," using  a [$40   iPad mount I bought from Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06WGNP9HD/ref=pe_3034960_233709270_TE_item). Mounting it this way has two  advantages: I look slightly up at the person I'm talking to rather than  down, and when I type notes into my computer, it doesn't look like I'm off  to the side."
* "Short answer: iPad + Airpods + Whereby is a really great combination in 2020. And it also works well with Zoom, which is good because you're stuck with it."
* I don't have a  recent iPad Pro but I might try this.

## Pontifications

* Remember when Lightroom was new and fast and it didn't require a $USD5900 Windows machine (source: [Paul Stamatiou @Stammy's Building a Lightroom PC](https://paulstamatiou.com/building-a-windows-10-lightroom-photo-editing-pc/#full_parts_list)) to run it fast for 'hobbyist' photographers? Neither do I :-)
* Time to switch to Lightroom CC or something much faster on mobile :-)
* Moral of the story: All software needs to be ruthlessly refactored eventually i.e. we all build big balls of mud :-) or something!
* By making RAW files too big and not doing any sort of in-camera or send to iOS and Android workflows, digital camera companies aren't doing 'hobbyists' any favours to make our workflow fast, convenient and fun.

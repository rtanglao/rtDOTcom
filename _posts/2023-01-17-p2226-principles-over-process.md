[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 17, 2023 22:26 [Principles over Process - Silicon Valley Product Group : Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/principles-over-process/) <-- principles not process! --> QUOTE: `But more generally, as to the question of what went wrong with Agile, I think the most important thing is to realize that there are the Agile principles, as captured in the manifesto, and there are the many Agile processes created ostensibly around those principles....My theory is that process people essentially took over Agile, and today most companies follow the processes, but arenâ€™t even close to living the principles....
This phenomenon is not unique to Agile.`

## Pontifications

* Learn R and statistics the hard way alert :-) aka d'oh! Kamyar told me that density plots only apply to continuous variables not variables like string colournames which are discrete variables, oops!
* Back to the drawing board, I will just convert the colournames back to 24 bit integer values and we will be back in business, I think :-)

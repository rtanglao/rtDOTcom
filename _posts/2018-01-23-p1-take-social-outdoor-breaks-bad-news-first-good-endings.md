    * "we are best off doing our brainless administrative work in the afternoons, like answering emails or filling our reports."
    * "The best way to get through an afternoon cognitive slump is to take a lot of breaks. " social and outdoor breaks are best
    * Pink says, "Given a choice, we prefer endings that elevate. We prefer rising sequences to declining sequences. So this is one of the ways this research has changed my own behaviour - not only am I taking more breaks, but I am the king of giving the bad news first."!

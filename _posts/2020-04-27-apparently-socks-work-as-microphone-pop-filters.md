* My tests ([test with no socks](https://www.rolandmicroblog.com/2020/04/27/no-pop-filter.html), [test with one sock](https://www.rolandmicroblog.com/2020/04/27/sock-pop-filter.html), [test with two socks](https://www.rolandmicroblog.com/2020/04/27/191724.html)) seem to agree with [this YouTube video that socks do work as pop filters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN03wwXiS3k)! Who'd have thunk it :-) ?!?

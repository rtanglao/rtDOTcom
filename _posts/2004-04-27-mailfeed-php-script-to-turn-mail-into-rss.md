Cool, need to check this one out!

From <a href="http://wonko.com/software/mailfeed/">MailFeed: Generate an RSS feed from a POP3, IMAP, or NNTP mailbox</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>MailFeed is a PHP script that checks a POP3, IMAP, or NNTP mailbox on demand and returns an RSS feed containing the messages in the mailbox.

I wrote MailFeed after realizing that it would be much more convenient  to read my email along with my morning RSS feeds.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

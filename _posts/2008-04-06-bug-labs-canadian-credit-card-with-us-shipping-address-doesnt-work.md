title: BUG Labs - Canadian Credit Card with US Shipping Address doesn't work

<p>I want the entire suite of Bug Modules but I live in Canada. I tried to order with my Canadian Credit Card with a US Shipping Address but as I suspected, it didn't work. Thanks to the fine folks at <a href="http://buglabs.net/">Bug Labs</a> for their patience in dealing with my multiple emails on this subject! It's not the end of the world but it's a bit disconcerting to see that despite "free trade" and "globalization", things haven't progressed since I was a kid ordering software and other gadgets from the USA in the 1970s and 80s, i.e. it's still ludicrously difficult to get gadgets over the border. Can we have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_agreement">Schengen</a> like zone between Canada and the USA please?</p>

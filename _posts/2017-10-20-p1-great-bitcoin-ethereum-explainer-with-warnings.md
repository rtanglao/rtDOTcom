## Pontifications

* Great "decentralized apps and organizations via bitcoin, ethereum, block chain, etc" explainer with some honesty about whether all this tech and infra is actually useful: [A Letter to Jamie Dimon And anyone else still struggling to understand cryptocurrencies](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80)

Juicy quotes and of course [read the whole thing](https://blog.chain.com/a-letter-to-jamie-dimon-de89d417cb80):

<blockquote>

Decentralized applications are a new form of organization and a new form of software. They’re a new model for creating, financing, and operating software services in a way that is decentralized top-to-bottom. That doesn’t make them better or worse than existing software models or the corporate entities that create them. As we’ll see later, there are major trade-offs. What we can say is simply that they are radically different from software as we know it today and radically different from the forms of organization we are used to.<br /><br/>

How different? Imagine the following: you grew up in a rainforest and I brought you a cactus and told you it was a tree. How would you react? You’d probably laugh and say it’s not a tree because there’s no point in a tree being a stumpy water tank covered in armor — after all, water is abundant here in the rainforest! This, roughly, is the reaction of many people working in Silicon Valley to decentralized applications.<br /><br/>

...<br /><br/>

In general, a decentralized application allows you to do something you can already do today (like payments) but without a trusted central party.<br /><br/>

Bottom line: centralized applications beat the pants off decentralized applications on virtually every dimension.<br /><br/>

EXCEPT FOR ONE DIMENSION.<br /><br/>

And not only are decentralized applications better at this one thing, they are the only way we can achieve it.<br /><br/>

What am I referring to?<br /><br/>

Censorship resistance.<br /><br/>

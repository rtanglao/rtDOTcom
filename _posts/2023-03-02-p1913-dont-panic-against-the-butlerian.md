[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Mar 2, 2023 19:13 [Don't Panic: Against The Butlerian Jihad on AI - by Rohit](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/dont-panic-against-the-butlerian#footnote-1-104698527) <--- can we not build things in the future with safety in mind from the beginning? instead of throwing things out there and having them fail and even kill people e.g. self driving cars? --> read the whole thing--> QUOTE: `Could we have gotten to ChatGPT through sheer focus on safety, as opposed to the urge to make an LLM that actually worked? Has there been a single event in the entire AI history as successful at making people scrutinise the problem and understand where they ought to course correct other than the Sydney launch? Regulations can’t guide us, because we don’t know what to regulate. This isn’t gain of function research, or nuclear proliferation, or climate change....So here's my suggestion. If you are truly freaked out about what the future might bring, go build something. You can even work on policy creation and focus for the tech that we have, and the tech we can see emerging. Working on “application of LLMs to the medical industry to speed up diagnoses” could very much require policy interventions and regulatory oversight, assuming they get revisited as the technology advances....And if you are truly excited about what the future might bring, go build something. Let your curiosity guide you. The only way is through.`

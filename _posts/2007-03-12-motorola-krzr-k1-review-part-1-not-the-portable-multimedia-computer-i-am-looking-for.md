Bottom line so far: for the power multi-media creator user, Nokia&#39;s phones are much better and I would pay my own money for a Nokia N95 or N93 or my mythical <a href="/rt/tags/n999">N999</a>, I wouldn&#39;t pay my own money for the KRZR. </p> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/417052257/" title="Trial KRZR K1 - cool metal case"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/177/417052257_db84f1eff4_s.jpg" alt="Trial KRZR K1 - Image164" width="75" height="75" align="left" /></a>  <br /> <br /><br />  <h2>Cool</h2><ol> <li>Came in an awesome aluminum briefcase</li> <li>Great form factor and light weight</li> <li>USB Charging</li> <li>Text Auto Complete even with ITAP turned off</li> <li>Camera has a nice mirror for self portraits</li> </ol> <h2>NOT COOL:</h2> <ol> <li>Cheesy Operating System (ugly to me but YMMV)</li> <li>Adapter for normal headphones must be unplugged to answer a call!</li> <li>no flash for camera - Nokia flash is not great but better than nothing. Sony Ericsson flashes are much better!</li> <li>the web browser doesn&#39;t allow you to change the home page (Rogers bug not Motorola bug?)</li> <li>the web browser is primitive and bad - sorry to be harsh, but compared to Nokia&#39;s Web kit browser or Opera, this browser is a toy: it doesn&#39;t support upload of attachments to mobile gmail, no way to enter a URL to surf to (you have to create a bookmark), many, many problems</li> <li>ShoZu doesn&#39;t work on this phone (Rogers bug?). A phone without ShoZu is like a phone without sunshine :-) !</li> <li>No WiFi - I wouldn&#39;t pay my own money for a phone without WiFi</li> <li>No obvious way to upload your photos or videos without going through USB or Bluetooth &quot;chain of pain&quot; - I prefer ShoZu but there&#39;s no support to upload photos to flickr and photos and video to Vox which the built in Nokia gallery app on all recent N series phones does</li> <li>Voice Recognition doesn&#39;t work for all commands (e,g, I can&#39;t turn off Bluetooth with a voice command)</li> </ol>

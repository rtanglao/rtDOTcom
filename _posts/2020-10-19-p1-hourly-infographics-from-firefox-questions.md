title: "What infographics should I make from hourly FF support questions? Barcode with a stripe for Operating System, and a stripe for hash of the question?"

*   (refer to my previous post: [Github Actions are super powerful and yaml is super confusing](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/10/18/p1-github-actions-super-great-yaml-is-super-confusing/)  )
*   My current thought is something easy!
*   For each question
    *   create a pink stripe for Windows, green for macOS, blue for Linux
    *   create a stripe whose colour is a hash value computed from the question title and content

title: Going to have to disagree with The Wirecutter -- Buy an Android flagship when it comes out and buy one every 2 years (if you can't afford every 2 years then buy an iPhone every 4 years)

## Pontifications

* [As I blogged before (and I was wrong it's 4 years for iOS and 2 years for Android), to be secure, if you have the money buy an iPhone the year it comes out and then hold onto it for four years](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/30/p1-300-per-year-for-up-to-date-iphone-450-a-year-for-up-to-date-android-phone/); for Android you have to do it every 2 years i.e. [don't believe what The Wirecutter or anybody else writes about Android updates](http://thewirecutter.com/blog/dear-wirecutter-budget-android-phone-security-updates/). 
* No Android phone manufacturer consistently updates their Android phones for 4 years from the date they are introduced like Apple does for 4 years from the date of introduction.
* And yes this is a scathing indictment of software and the mobile phone industry! Sad face but true :-)
* Obviously this doesn't apply if you are a phone nerd and can handle the risk of bricking your phone by applying 3rd party Android firmware (if and only if the 3rd party Android firmware gets the updates in a timely fashion for 4 years for your phone). But most people aren't phone nerds nor should they be!

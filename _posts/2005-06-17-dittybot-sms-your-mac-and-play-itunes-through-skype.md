<p>I am not going to try this but it's a very cool hack!
</p>
<p>From <a href="http://plasticbugs.com/index.php?p=267">Dittybot</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>You send a text message from your mobile phone to your POP email account. Your text message should contain the keywords of a song title (and possibly an artist name) that you want to hear. DittyBot finds that email (he checks Mail every 45 seconds) and copies the song name into a text file. The song name is then copied into iTunes and a playlist is created from your search. Next, DittyBot loads Skype (the internet telephony app) and begins calling your mobile phone. Your mobile phone rings and when you pick it up, you should hear your song start playing in all its compressed glory. DittyBot will play your selection to you over your phone until you hang up. Mind you, this all should happen within 1 minute of sending your song request (depending on the speed of your POP server). Sometimes it's even quicker!
</p>
<p>That wasn't so hard now, was it?
</p>
<p>Sure, this is silly. However, it's only a small demonstration of the power of Applescript. DittyBot's ability to juggle all these apps should give the tinkerers out there yet another reason to consider buying an Apple.
</p>
<p>Before you can start using DittyBot to play iTunes songs through your cell phone, there's a decent amount of setup involved. So pay attention.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

title: " MSN Spaces implements IE only Blog it Bookmarklet, why?"

<p>It would be trivial to implement a Bookmarklet that works in Firefox (or h*ck I bet you could even implement one that would work on both!), so why didn't the MSN Spaces team do this?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/carnage4life/Blog/cns!1piiOwAp2SJRIfUfD95CnRLw!226.entry">A comment on Carnage4Life's Space: What Blog Posting APIs are supported by MSN Spaces?</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>While this does not represent our API strategy, we have implemented a basic HTTP URL based "API" that we use for the Blog It functionality (IE only). While this serves a different purpose than the APIs Dare is discussing, this URL can be used to pre-populate the on-line blog entry forms. The details can be found by following my blog url above (as well as an "experimental" IE toolbar button for quickly blogging on-line articles).</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

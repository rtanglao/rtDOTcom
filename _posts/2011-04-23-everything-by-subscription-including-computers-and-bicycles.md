<p>You know you are getting old when you don't care about owning things anymore. Except for Google limiting my freedom of choice to install a better browser like Firefox,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_rumored_preparing_10month_chrome_os_laptop.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+readwriteweb+%28ReadWriteWeb%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"> a computer for $10/month</a> sounds great as long as that includes awesome connectivity and bandwidth! Where do I sign :-) ?</p><p>I'd also like bicycles by subscription. I'd pay $40 a month for example for a <a href="http://www.cycleexif.com/wolfies-cycles">vintage bicycle cruiser</a> (Danu at <a href="http://theworldcycles.com/">The World Cycles </a>here in East Vancouver has many many fantastic cruisers from the 1930s, 40s and the 50s) with all the bells and whistles (hub dynamo, 3-10 gears, built in powerful lights, fenders, chain guard).</p><p>I think there's a small, fun "lifestyle" business there: for folks who want an awesome bicycling experience and don't want to do bike maintenance: pay upfront a deposit of a few hundred dollars and then $40-50 a month (which includes monthly quick tuneups). In return you get an fantastic bike impeccably maintained with all the goodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

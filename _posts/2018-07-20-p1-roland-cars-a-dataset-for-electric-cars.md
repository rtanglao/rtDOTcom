title: "roland-cars a dataset for electric cars in Canada"
---

## Pontifications

Just for fun, I will do a dataset, "roland-cars" around electric cars in Canada:

* exclude sports cars like Tesla and has to be "affordable"
* include all safety features
* exclude paying extra for Android and Apple Car
* 60 month lease price
* 48 month lease price
* plug in hybrids
* range
* pure electric as well as PHEV
* have to be able to go to Cypress (80km round trip, 1000metre elevation rise in  sub zero temperatures twice a week for 5 months of year)
* would be nice if it can make it to Whistler Olympic Park which is 130km one way, so 260km round trip
* factor in the $2500 BC rebate for PHEV and $5000 BC rebate for EV

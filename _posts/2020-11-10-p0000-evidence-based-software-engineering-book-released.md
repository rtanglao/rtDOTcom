[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 10, 2020. [Evidence-based software engineering: book released](http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2020/11/08/evidence-based-software-engineering-book-released/) <--- complete with R code and data!

title: "Blogging for over 17 years, you should try it!"

## Pontifications

* I've been blogging since 1999. 
* Over 15 years! In fact over 17 years! My first blog was on Radio Userland and sadly is gone.
* [Then Movable Type in 2004](http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/03/16/hello-world/), then Drupal and now Jekyll!
* I have no grandious thoughts other than just do it! And I don't plan this blog nor have I ever really planned it. I'm sure that's obvious :-)
* Forcing yourself to write daily or at least periodically or at least once a week is something everybody should do for at least a year. Why? To improve your writing! Try it not for money!
* And if you get a chance, try it for money. 
* Both are valid and both are equally challenging. And yes I've done both. I blogged professionally for Bryght 2004-2008.
* And it's a YES AND ! IF you must, use somebody else's silo like instagram or twitter or facebook or whatever the flavour of the month is in addition to blogging.

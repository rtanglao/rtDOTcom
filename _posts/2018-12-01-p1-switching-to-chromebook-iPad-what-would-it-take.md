title: "Switching to a Chromebook or iPad from Windows or Mac laptop, what would it take?"
---
## Pontifications

* Good question :-)
* I switched to a Surface Book laptop running Windows from OS X and I'm still alive :-) Both now have great Linux / Unix / BSD command lines :-)
* I guess all I need is a Unix command line that runs R, R Studio, ruby, python and Chromebook has one so I could switch to a Chromebook.
* Switching to an iPad would be more difficult since there is no built-in Unix command line (but I suppose i could ssh to a server?!? Awkward but many others!
* It would be nice if Firefox was supported 100% on a Chromebook but I'm not holding my breath. How popular are Chromebooks? Never say never :-)

## Pontifications

* [Dmitry Shkolnik: A look at the Vancouver mayoral race twitter picture](https://www.dshkol.com/2018/vancouver-mayor-race-twitter/) using R packages: [textfeatures](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textfeatures/index.html), tidytext, [syuzhet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=syuzhet), and [rtweet](https://rtweet.info/) is about [200 lines of code](https://github.com/dshkol/scratchpad/blob/master/content/post/2018-10-01-a-look-at-the-vancouver-mayor-twitter-picture.Rmd). Amazing, must dig into this post and the book about tidytext, [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)

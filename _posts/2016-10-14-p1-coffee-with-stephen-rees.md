title: Coffee with Stephen Rees - retired Planner and global warming realist

## Pontifications

* Two days ago, I had coffee with the fabulous [Stephen Rees](https://stephenrees.wordpress.com/).
* He agreed with me (and I believe that I learned this from Stephen, I don't have original thoughts on this subject :-) !) that it's time to go on a WWII-style war-time footing against global warming and we should be trying to decrease carbon and temperature rise not merely stop increasing it!
* So much more wisdom that I hope he can blog about; can't do his words justice!

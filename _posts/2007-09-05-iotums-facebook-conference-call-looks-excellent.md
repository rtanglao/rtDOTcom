<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Mac Skype has a keypad icon which you click on to send DTMF tones which&nbsp; means i can easily use the Iotum app without paying, cool! hopefully this works on N800 Skype too]&nbsp;</p><p>I tried a conference call to myself on the weekend and it worked fine! I couldn&#39;t get it to work with Mac Skype (couldn&#39;t figure out how send my phone number, how does one send a DTMF tones in Mac Skype?) but that&#39;s Skype&#39;s fault and I am sure will be easily remedied. This will be great for impromptu calls.</p> <p>Question: is this a <a href="http://lypp.com/">Lypp</a> competitor? Answer: I think it could be but is not directly!</p>From <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2007/09/05/finally-a-useful-application-on-facebook/">&quot;Finally, a useful application on Facebook&quot; &mdash; Alec Saunders .LOG</a>:  <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   For North American users, the calls are free. You call our bridge in the 218 area code, and pay only the charges you would normally pay, whether that&#39;s airtime on your cellular phone, or long distance on your land line. As Jim Courtney at the Skype Journal discovered yesterday, you can even make the calls from Skype &mdash; great if you have an unlimited Skype account. </blockquote> <p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

<p>Go Samsung go! Only a matter of time before cameraphones with 3 megapixels and above and 3x optical zoom replace low end point and shoot cameras.</p><p>From <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/samsung/samsung-schs250-reviewed-verdict-5mp-cameraphones-are-nice-039837.php">Samsung SCH-S250 Reviewed (Verdict: 5MP Cameraphones are Nice) : Gizmodo</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Want to know what the pictures from a cameraphone with a 5-megapixel sensor look like? MobileBurn has a review of the Samsung SCH-S250, a Korea-only import that was one of the first from Samsung to feature a high-megapixel sensor (which means no optical zoom like the models announced this year). The pictures are okay, but there is a lot of noise and a lack of color depth to most of them, which bears out the thinking that more megapixels does not necessarily mean more better. Still, it%u2019s interesting to see some shots from the same sensors that will likely be in our phones next year.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

## Pontifications

* [The Eero wifi router with 2 beacons](https://eero.com/shop/home-wifi-system)  has seemingly solved our WiFi issues in our 1600 square foot three story flat. Speedtest now consistently shows 10Mbits/second down and 1.58Mbits/second up which is much more than before
* Easy to configure, easy to setup. What could possibly go wrong :-) ??!? 
* Far better than the two kickstarter routers I had before

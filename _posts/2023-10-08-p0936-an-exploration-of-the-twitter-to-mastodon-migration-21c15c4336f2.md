Nicholson ¦ CUInfoScience ¦ Oct, 2023 ¦ Medium](https://medium.com/cuinfoscience/an-exploration-of-the-twitter-to-mastodon-migration-21c15c4336f2) <-- **QUOTE**: `The social media landscape has changed profoundly since November 2022. Our survey provides early evidence into the motivations and challenges for users who are migrating between platforms. In the context of the migration(s) between Twitter and Mastodon in late 2022 and early 2023, we find that Elon Musk’s acquisition and accompanying changes were a common “push” factor driving users away from Twitter, but there are also features of Mastodon that “pulled” users toward it. Contrary to popular narratives that “users don’t care about federation,” a majority of our respondents named Mastodon’s federated affordances as distinguishing features that “pulled” them towards adoption. Perspectives about Twitter versus Mastodon differ significantly with substantially greater positive attributions made to Mastodon, even among active users of Twitter.` --> See also: https://erinkissane.com/mastodon-is-easy-and-fun-except-when-it-isnt , https://techpolicy.press/the-whiteness-of-mastodon/ and https://www.wired.com/story/black-twitter-social-media/

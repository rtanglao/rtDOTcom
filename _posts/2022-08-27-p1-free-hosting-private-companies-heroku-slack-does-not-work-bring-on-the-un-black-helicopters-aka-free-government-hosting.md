title: "Free hosting from for profit companies like Heroku, Slack etc doesn't work. Don't depend on it! Only viable long term solution is for the UN Black Helicopters :-) i.e. the government to offer hosting"

* [My tweet about free doesn't last forever to be fair H\*roku's free lasted 15 years!](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1563327476449054721): `i'm biased obvs so i won't comment on Sl*ck or H*roku but eventually you have to pay for free stuff. So if you can, it's better to use free open source stuff from day 1 since FOSS stuff almost always offers an export path from day 1 even if the FOSS stuff is harder at the start.`
* [My tweet about free hosting should be offered by the government](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1563552664851742721): `Get off my lawn "incomprehensible to oldsters like me" "dyno pricing model" :-) I feel and am probably wrong as always :-) that governments and educational institutions should run "simple" :-) free hosting for open source and small hobby projects.`
* Probably won't happen but I can dream can't I?
* Previously: April 2017: [How to deploy mastodon on heroku - use the deploy button?!?](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/04/15/p1-mastodon-on-heroku/)  which had the following "great" :-) quotes
  * `I still don’t understand Heroku’s pricing model.`
  * [Official docs which state you can’t do reply mastodon  on free dynos](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Running-Mastodon/Heroku-guide.md): `Running on Heroku's hobby Dynos and free add-on tiers has limited testing purposes and is not recommended in production.`

>For travelers, I suggest trying to find a hotel in either an old town or a ‘medium’ town. Often the latter can be a better choice, but it can sometimes be a bit difficult to parse exactly where said ‘medium’ town is without getting your feet on the ground first. The satellite and Baidu street view can only tell you so much.

>Note that fancy western hotel chains often tend to be located within the new town. A local Chinese hotel chain, ‘Jinjiang’, is our usual go-to and tends to have hotels in a diversity of neighborhoods. Because it can sometimes be difficult to tell where exactly is most interesting to be located, a decent idea if you’re staying in one city for a while is to only book two nights at first. This way you can easily change hotels if you find a neighborhood you prefer.

> For living, as I said before, I find those older ‘commie blocks’ livable enough and would totally live in one again in a pinch. However, for me at least, the best of all worlds is to find a newer development that’s flanking a ‘medium’ town, an old town, or an urban village. This way you can get a little more light and space, while having all the benefit of being in a walkable neighborhood.

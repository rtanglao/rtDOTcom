<p>As usual, the Flickr crew are doing a stellar job of answering people's flames :-) It could have been communicated better (I read the <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/08/flickr_and_yaho.html">blog</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/central/discuss/70680/page2/#comment565551">flickrCentral post</a> and thought it was confusing and still do)  as in: 
<ol><li>Your photos will still have the same URL and you will still have the same moniker on flickr</li>
<li>But you will have to get a Yahoo Id to login
</li> <li>Why? Because having two systems to login doesn't make sense. the time we spend maintaining a separate Flickr id is time that we don't have to add cool new features.  using the Yahoo ID to login will give us more time to add cool new features.</li> </ol>
 Pretty simple, eh? I don't intend on moving off of Flickr any time soon. Quite happy to be in their trunk :-) All we need now is the ability to print (which is coming) and the ability to backup to DVD (which I hope is coming) and I will be ecstatic!</p>

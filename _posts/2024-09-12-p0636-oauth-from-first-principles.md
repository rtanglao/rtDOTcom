[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Sep 12, 2024 06:36 [OAuth from First Principles - Stack Auth](https://stack-auth.com/blog/oauth-from-first-principles) <- Super complicated in 2024, was it always so :-) ? **QUOTE**: `This is an informal explanation of the OAuth flow, and the actual specification is much longer. For example, client secrets, refresh tokens, client credentials flow, token grants, etc., are not covered here. ... Furthermore, there are a lot of nitty-gritty details that are required for a secure implementation. You probably shouldn't implement your own OAuth client.`

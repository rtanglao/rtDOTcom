Oldie but goodie that I must re-read now that I have a <a href="http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> blog hence the re-post.  The CSS and JavaScript and HTML stuff apply to <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a> blogs too.  Only the template stuff differs.  But once you have figured out one templating system, the second and third and fourth :-) (I think this is the about the 5th or 6th blog templating system that I have learned) comes easier.

From <a href="http://www.mediatinker.com/blog/archives/007806.html">mediatinker.com</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Tackling Movable Type templates and CSS for the first time can be daunting. The MT default templates contain four kinds of code: CSS, HTML, MT tags, and Javascript.

If you're new to all this, you're about to learn that it pays to make a careful study of the code. Once you understand the way it works together, it's pretty easy to modify your MT templates to display almost any design you want.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

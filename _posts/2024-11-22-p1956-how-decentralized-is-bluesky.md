Bravo and many thanks! **Credible Exit** is an incredible phrase, we all need one right?--> **QUOTE**: `Under these definitions, Bluesky and ATProto are not meaningfully decentralized, and are not federated either. However, this is not to say that Bluesky is not achieving something useful; while Bluesky is not building what is presently a decentralized Twⅈtter, it is building an excellent replacement for Twⅈtter, and Bluesky's main deliverable goal is something else instead: a Twⅈtter replacement, with the possibility of "credible exit".`

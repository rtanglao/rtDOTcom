* [Got my 2023 COVID and Flu shots at Rexall in Chinatown today. Rexall was taking walk-ins because their booking system was down! We asked about walk-ins in the future and the Rexall folks said whether walk-ins are accepted is an ever changing situation that could change tomorrow i.e. don't expect walk-ins everywhere every day! Thanks to Tara Robertson for the tip on instagram!](https://devdilettante.com/@roland/111236368426648143)
* So far so good! Go science go!

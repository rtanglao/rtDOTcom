title: 24 squares 1 per hour

## Pontification :-)
* I guess I am obsessed with square pie charts :-).
* My next idea for an infographic for January 1-31, 2016 is to calculate the average colour hourly using [Kip's algorithm from last year](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/02/06/p1-why-is-a-curly-bracket-required-after-square-bracket/) (code: [get dominant colour in buckets](https://github.com/rtanglao/rtgram/blob/master/getDominantColourInBuckets.rb)) and then make 24 squares per day.

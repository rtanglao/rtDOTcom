<p>I <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/4623569/">supported</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> (who I believe paved the way for <a href="http://www.kottke.org/">Kottke</a> et al) last year (and intend to do so again) and will definitely be supporting Kottke and the the <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/">Burningbird</a>ster :-) soon! Who's next? <a href="http://www.ensight.org/">Jeremy</a>? <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/">Robin Good</a>? Still wish <a href="http://ahawkins.org/">Al</a> would give it a go but <a href="http://ahawkins.org/2005/03/04.html#a403">I understand why he didn'</a>t!

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Based on all of this, I'm in the process of creating a Sponsoring Burningbird page, and if you have time, could you check it out and tell me what you think? In addition, I would like to build up a page containing links and small snapshots to sites that I've helped in the past - either with design and/or web development. If I've helped you in the past, and you wouldn't mind being included in this page, could you drop me a comment or send me an email?</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

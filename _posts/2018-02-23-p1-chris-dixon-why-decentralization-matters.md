## Pontifications

* Juicy Quote:

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

"Centralized platforms have been dominant for so long that many people have forgotten there is a better way to build internet services. Cryptonetworks are a powerful way to develop community-owned networks and provide a level playing field for 3rd-party developers, creators, and businesses. We saw the value of decentralized systems in the first era of the internet. Hopefully weâ€™ll get to see it again in the next.

* Crypto powered or not (and really is there any other way to do it?), decentralized will come back; if not to public prominence at least in the peer 2 peer or network in the "shadows" :-)

I HAVE THE LAST AIR FRYER FRENCH FRY RECIPE YOU WILL EVER NEED. 
I am a big-ass nerd. You know this, right?
So when I was at a restaurant a few years back with a friend and they had the crunchiest fries with the fluffiest interior, I asked staff about how they got such great texture. The secret was vinegar and salt in the water when soaking to remove starch.
And one time I made potato chips where it called to soak them for 10 minutes in boiling water. Crunchiest ever. 
I decided to combine the two methods. 
If you don’t know, soaking potatoes before roasting or frying is how you get the starch out, because starch kills the crunchy. (But they gotta be dry after so if you’re boiling or steaming before roasting or frying, let them cool completely so the steam evaporates for a fluffier potato.)
Also, older russet potatoes are better than fresh ones, because they have less moisture so the inside gets fluffier. 
ANYHOO. 
Cut your potatoes like French fries. I do about 1/4” thick slices or so. 
Rinse with cold water TWICE. Drain well. Put 1.5 litres of water in a kettle and bring to a boil. 
Add into the potato bowl: a handful of salt and 1/4 cup of white vinegar and ONLY white vinegar. None of that other stuff.
Toss the potatoes. Pour the boiling water over them. Stir. Soak for 10 minutes. Drain. Rinse with cold water. Drain. 
Spread on a tea towel and let dry, or dry it. 
Preheat the air fryer to 360°. 
Put the potatoes in a dry clean bowl and toss with 1-2 tablespoons of your chosen fat. I used guanciale — rendered pork jowl fat leftover from carbonara last night. 
You could use duck fat, chicken fat, bacon, olive oil, avocado oil — anything works. Personally I think bacon and chicken are too heavy and I would stick to guanciale, olive, duck, and other rich oils that won’t overtake the flavour profile. 
Toss with salt. Add to air fryer. Cook for 20-25 minutes at 360° shaking basket often. 
Coming up to 20 minutes, taste a smaller fry to see how it’s seasoned. Salt won’t stick once you take it out, so if it needs more salt, spritz lightly with some oil and sprinkle generous salt on. A lot of it will shake off, remember! Finish cooking. Serve! Enjoy! 
I had mine with mayo that I added lemon zest and garlic to. 
Check out the video in the comments for how loud the crunch is. Turn the sound on!

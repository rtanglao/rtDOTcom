title: It's 2016 why are we still stuck w/keyboards and printing recognition isn't working?

## Pontifications

* It's 2016 and we still don't have printing recognition as good as the last model of the Newton. No disrespect to [Nebo](http://myscript.com/nebo/) which does a great job on the iPad Pro 9.7 and presumably the iPad Pro 12 inch but it should be part of the OS and not involve a hard to carry, bulky stylus!
* Why?
* Maybe we don't need it? Maybe voice and touch keyboards and other UX gestures will be good enough. That's what I would like. Alternative UX methods like voice and touch for quick snippets and some sort of keyboard for long writing. Can't  wait for that day!

title: " Ning - Diego and I will have to disagree"

<p>I still disagree about <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/d2r/">Ning</a>. I still think the marketing copy on their website comparing Ning to flickr et al is <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=disingenuous">disingenuous</a> and I still think that Ning won't fly in the long run. However I still believe that in the long run Diego will be even more successful than he is now because he's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000073.html">a smart person who gets things done</a>.</p>

 <p>From <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/10/05/ning_i_dont_get_it_is_it_drupal_lite_hypercard_for_webapps#comments">Diego's comment on Roland Tanglao's Weblog: Ning - I don't get it - Is it Drupal lite? Hypercard for webapps?</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Hey Roland,

<p>Good questions. :) Just a few points:
</p>
<p>1- We're not comparing the photosharing app with Flickr. Flickr is an awesome service, but it serves a different, albeit related, need. The Flickr comparison is just to frame what it is, not to say that they're the same.</p>
<p>2- "they get my app" -- everyone developing apps on Ning benefits from what others have done. That's why the license for the code in the playground is Creative Commons.
</p><p>- If you have enough knowledge to set up your own service, you probably won't have a use for Ning, and that's cool. Consider though: many people have enough knowledge to tinker but not enough knowledge (or time) to maintain a hosted account, or manage a DB, and many people could benefit from being able to use these app patterns for their own needs, without having to go through setup and maintenance.
</p>-<p> PHP: over time we'll be adding support for other languages, such as Python and Ruby.</p>
<p>- URL ampersands and such: I hear ya. We're on it :)</p>

Kudos to <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> for addressing the concerns of the community with an excellent FAQ.  If only other companies would respond so well to feedback.

From the <a href="http://www.typekey.com/faq/">TypeKey FAQ</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>With Movable Type comment registration, we've provided a great deal of options for weblog owners. At release (remember, we're still in Alpha), we plan to provide a detailed user's guide to comment registration and comment management options. But, for now, we want to provide a glimpse of the commenting options.

With Movable Type 3.0 you have options. You can:
<ol><li>Only accept TypeKey-authenticated comments where the commenter sends an email address</li><li>Only accept TypeKey-authenticated comments</li><li>Accept TypeKey-authenticated and moderated comments</li><li>Accept TypeKey-authenticated and regular comments</li><li>Accept moderated comments</li><li>Accept unmoderated comments</li><li>Accept anonymous comments</li></ol>
Currently in Movable Type, 6 and 7 are the only two options. 1 through 5 have been added to create a varying degree of accountability.

While comment registration is not the right answer for every weblog, Movable Type 3.0 and TypeKey provide a flexible system that we feel will work for the majority of Movable Type users."</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

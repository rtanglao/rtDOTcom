* Read the whole thing: [Denis Stetskov via mhoye:: The First Full-Scale Cyber War: 4 Years of Lessons](https://techtrenches.dev/p/the-first-full-scale-cyber-war-4)

>Ukrzaliznytsia’s trains ran because they’d been attacked before. Kyivstar, despite security investment, had no institutional memory of crisis response.

>Preparation compounds. Vulnerability compounds.

>Every organization running critical infrastructure faces a choice: build systems during peace for crises that will come, or scramble during attacks with tools that don’t exist.

>The cyber war in Ukraine isn’t just a regional conflict. It’s a live demonstration of what works when nation-state attackers target infrastructure.

>The lessons are available. The question is whether anyone is paying attention.

title: "Is auto-tagging (like flickr) possible with SUMO Firefox Desktop Support Forum posts? e.g. using Keras?"

## Pontifications

* My guess: yes! But like flickr it will make mistakes?! i.e. tags will be wrong sometime
* Maybe we just need to train the auto-tagger on about 100-500 posts per release? (and say 1000 from previous releases)
* Maybe this article will help: [Intro to text classification with Keras: automatically tagging Stack Overflow posts](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/intro-to-text-classification-with-keras-automatically-tagging-stack-overflow-posts)

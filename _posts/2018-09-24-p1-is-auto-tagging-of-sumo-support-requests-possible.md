title: "Is auto-tagging (like flickr) possible with SUMO Firefox Desktop Support Forum posts?"

## Pontifications

* My guess: yes! But like flickr it will make mistakes?! i.e. tags will be wrong sometime
* Maybe we just need to train the auto-tagger on about 100-500 posts per release? (and say 1000 from previous releases)

title: "Slack bot chat interface for replying to Google Play Store reviews?!?!"
---

## Pontifications
The following is just a thought experiment:

* DM a bot to ask for reviews to reply e.g. ```/review```
	* maybe you get 5-10 reviews
	* emoji for skip, emoji for spam, emoji for nonsense reviews
	* reply to a review via slack's reply feature
* DM the same bot to ask for reviews to moderate e.g. ```/moderate```
* emoji for skip, emjoi for thumbs up, emoji for thumbs down, can, maybe have a command for editing, a review reply

### Pros
* userids are taken care of
* easy text driven interface, works wherever slack works, i.e. on mobile, on desktop, etc
* emojis are fun :-)

### Cons
* you need a slack id which might be limited in supply, maybe just do this for moderating?

## Pontifications

* MUST READ!
* Some Juicy Tidbits from [Brent Cannon's Setting expectations for open source participation](https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/):
	* ```Everything in open source should be a series of kindnesses```
	* ```Pay for open source with kindness```
	* ```But when someone in open source makes demands it's like the person passing through the door criticizing how I held the door open. It's pointless and simply leads to people no longer being willing to hold open doors for others.```
	* ```feedback must be constructive```
	* ```negative feedback is never necessary. If you called a project stupid it helps no one. It doesn't help me because I can't act on being called stupid. And it isn't a kindness because you could have simply said that my project wasn't helpful to you for whatever reason```

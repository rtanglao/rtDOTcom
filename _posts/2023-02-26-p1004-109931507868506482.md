Also: FrankPasquale: [Instead of saying “employers are using AI to analyze workers’ emotions” we might say “employers are using software advertised as having the ability to label workers’ emotions based on images of them from photographs and video. We don’t know how the labeling process works because the companies that sell these products claim that information as a trade secret](https://mastodon.social/@FrankPasquale/109929025334956991) <-- from Center on Privacy & Technology, a think tank at Georgetown Law: [Artifice and Intelligence](https://medium.com/center-on-privacy-technology/artifice-and-intelligence%C2%B9-f00da128d3cd)

<p>Oh boy, what next? Boycott is the only answer.

<p>From <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/">EFF: DeepLinks</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Using a program called a rootkit, inserting a Sony BMG music CD will now infect your computer with a nefarious program, burying it deeply and obscurely within your operating system. The program will monitor your computer activity in the name of preventing the so-called epidemic of "piracy" that results from people making extra copies of their music CDs or favorite songs. Worse yet, there is no "uninstall" feature on these program. It's like the roach motel -- once Sony BMG's surveillance program checks in, you can't make it check out without completely wiping your entire system clean. Such practices have been widely condemned in the computer world, even by Microsoft's own research division.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

title: "Broken CFMU podcast scene :-) due to React perhaps?"
---
I can't listen to my friend Kevin's [second](https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-12/) and [third](https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-19/) pre 1989 alternative 80s shows because the web developer failed or something or React fails? [The first episode](https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-05/) works fine. I tried debugging it with Firefox web tools and couldn't figure it out i.e. I'm a terrible hobbyist web developer part 8888 :-).

Outline](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/)):  [Killing Me Softly](https://fobettarh.github.io/Killing-Me-Softly/) via [Tara Robertson](http://tararobertson.ca/) who wrote: "Fobazi Ettarh's text based game is a  clever and creative way for people to see how microaggressions impact  people who are different from them. I found it powerful to see the  options that were crossed out and no longer available for me due to  accumulated physical, mental and emotional stress"

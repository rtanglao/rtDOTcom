<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/391450931/" title="My FON router"><img style="margin-right: 5px" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/135/391450931_ccc984a69a_m.jpg" alt="Unboxing the FON router - 15/02/2007" width="240" height="180" align="left" /></a> <p> My <a href="http://www.fon.com/en/">FON</a> router works! Hurray! Now sharing WiFi with the world! Couldn&#39;t get it to work with my hub like the ancient Airport Base Station does which makes no sense. If I plug it directly into the ADSL modem it works, just doesn&#39;t work plugged in indirectly like the Airport Base Station was! Do I need a cross over eithernet cable to make it work with my hub? </p><p> Other quirks: maybe this is a bug in Apple&#39;s Airport but sometimes the router works but doesn&#39;t show as connected. Also, it took forever (more than 5 minutes!) for FON_AP to show up as a WiFi network after plugging in the router. Finally, the registration webapp on the site wouldn&#39;t accept my street address as valid. I had to manually move to my location on the Google map to make it accept my address. Weird! </p>

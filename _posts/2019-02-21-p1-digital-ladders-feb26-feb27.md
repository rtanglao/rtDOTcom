* From the "This is going to be fun" department:
  * I am one of the [faculty](https://www.digitalladders.ca/who-we-are) who will be teaching (more like dis-coordinating in the best positive sense! you know like [cogdog](https://cogdogblog.com/), [Brian Lamb's abject learning](https://abject.ca/about/) or [D'arcy Norman](https://darcynorman.net/)) [Digital Ladders](https://www.digitalladders.ca/) [Workshops](https://www.digitalladders.ca/workshops) February 25-26, 2019 to arts folks who are unencumbered by large amounts of digital knowledge :-). It's going to be fun brainstorming and helping arts folks fill in their digital knowledge. Can't wait!

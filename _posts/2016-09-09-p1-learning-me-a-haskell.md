title: Learning me a Haskell from Haskell Programming from first Principles by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki
---
## Pontification :-)
* Why? Why not? Easer than Lisp intro to functional programming. I also want to write my own ebook with a similar learning style.
* I'd like to build my Tshirts from instagram metadata using software that's easier to follow and has tests and haskell seems like an excellent choice.
* Get [the Haskell book](http://haskellbook.com/), you won't regret it!
* I'd also like to learn more R, Julia and any language for Instagram machine learning (probably means more python!).

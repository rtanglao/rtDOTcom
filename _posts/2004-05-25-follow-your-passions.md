Follow your passions, put your stuff out there online (and of course blogs are one of the best ways to do this)  and people will find it.  That's the lesson of this great article by <a href="http://collisiondetection.net/">Clive Thompson.</a>

From <a href="http://www.walrusmagazine.com/04/05/06/1929205.shtml">The Walrus Magazine | Game Theories</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Castronova sighs. Though he has made his career out of studying these economies, he is dismayed by how the real world has bled into the virtual one. "I liked it better when they were just, you know, games," he says wistfully. He preferred the meritocratic feel of EverQuest, before all the duping and the auctions and the bidding wars for powerful avatars. He liked the idea of on-line worlds as a place you migrated to when, like an immigrant, you wanted a new lease on life &#8212; just as three years ago, when, depressed and lonely, he first stumbled into EverQuest.

His own voyage had a good ending. A few months ago, the communications department at Indiana University in Bloomington called. They had read his work and wanted to talk. Weeks later, they offered him a fully tenured position in a new department. Castronova had still never published a single one of his EverQuest papers in print; all his analyses had been distributed on-line. "It's all PDFs and Web sites," he joked. Like an avatar in the game, he had levelled up.

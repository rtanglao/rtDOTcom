```
Welcome to Counterexamples in Type Systems, a compendium of 
horrible programs that crash, segfault or otherwise explode.

The "counterexamples" here are programs that go wrong in ways 
that should be impossible: corrupt memory in Rust, produce a 
ClassCastException in cast-free Java, segfault in Haskell, and 
so on. This book is a collection of such counterexamples, 
each with some explanation of what went wrong and references 
to the languages or systems in which the problem occurred.

It's intended as a resource for researchers, designers and 
implementors of static type systems, as well as 
programmers interested in how type systems fit together (or don't).

* See my previous post: [Can't wait for Lev Manovich's Cultural Analytics  which should be 100% applicable to my hobby of making tshirts and  leggings from flickr data](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/05/10/p1-lev-manovich-cultural-analytics/)
* Introduction How to see 1 billion images  <--- On a smaller scale, perhaps we should also learn how to see the 1000s of images that most of us take with our cameraphones and that others take of the neighbourhoods we live, work and play in.
* The above note comes from my checkvist outline: [Reading Notes - Cultural Analytics - Lev Manovich](https://checkvist.com/p/wnqw1vukO7eInCigqIq5IL) where I plan on taking notes as I read the book. You can check the link out or bookmark this post,;here's the embed:

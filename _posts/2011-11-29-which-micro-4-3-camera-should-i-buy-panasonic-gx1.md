title: Which Micro 4/3 camera should I buy? Panasonic GX1?

<p>I am currently leaning towards the not yet shipping <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/panasonicdmcgx1/">Panasonic GX1</a>. Thoughts? I want something that will fit in a sports jacket pocket and that can shoot decent ISO 1600. And assuming I am happy, I will then get rid of all my DSLR gear in a year or two.</p>

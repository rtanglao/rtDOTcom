Today I tried out <a href="http://www.flixwagon.com/">flixwagon</a>, "a stream live from cellphone" competitor to Qik. I did a "Carcast" direct from my N95 (mounted on the empty passenger seat with my Gorillapod) as I drove from Gastown to the Viaduct (12 minutes). Impressive!<br />
What Flixwagon seems better at then Qik:

<ol>
  <li>Better buffering</li>

  <li>More "Ajax-y" website</li>
</ol><br />
What Qik seems better at then Flixwagon:

<ol>
  <li>Non Cheesy look and feel. I could live without the little flixwagon icon moving about before the video is shown and the "too cute" flixwagon smiley icons.</li>

  <li>Higher Resolution. Qik <span style="font-style: italic;">seems</span> to be higher resolution the flixwagon. Qik is 320x240, Flixwagon seems to be lower resolution</li>

  <li><strike>Better URLs. There seems to be no flixwagon equivalent of <a href="http://qik.com/roland">qik.com/roland</a>. If it's there  I couldn't find it.</strike> <strong>UPDATE</strong>: it's there! found it by URL hacking, no obvious link when logged in, my page is indeed <a href="http://flixwagon.com/roland">flixwagon.com/roland</a><br /></li>

  
</ol><br />

Anyways the proof is in the video and both Qik and Flixwagon are evolving at a rapid rate, so let the competition continue!
Check out my flixwagon "CarCast":

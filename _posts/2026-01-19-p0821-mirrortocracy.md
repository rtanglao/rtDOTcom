Try, just for a mo­ment, to sup­pose that it's pro­bab­ly un­natur­al for an in­dust­ry to be so heavi­ly dominated by white/asian middle-class males under 30 who keep tell­ing each other to only hire their friends. Hav­ing sup­posed that, think about what a just fu­ture should look like, and how to get there.`

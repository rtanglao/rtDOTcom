RTWT --> **QUOTE**: `My dream is to work on ambitious projects with 2-20 core contributors over 1-100 months per project. When the project is complete and stable and beautiful, all of us stop working on it and move onto different projects. If built on a small/stable/well-defined platform/VM, it should work indefinitely (like Mario Kart 64).`

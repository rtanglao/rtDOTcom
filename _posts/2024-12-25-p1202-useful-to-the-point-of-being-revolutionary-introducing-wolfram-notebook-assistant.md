Not convinced but willing to be proven wrong :-)! Stephen Wolfram 2024-12-09:: Writings Useful to the Point of Being Revolutionary: Introducing Wolfram Notebook Assistant](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2024/12/useful-to-the-point-of-being-revolutionary-introducing-wolfram-notebook-assistant/) <-- Mr. Wolfram makes "AI" sound so compelling, maybe it's easier for a closed system like Mathematica to use ML and to improve upon it?!?

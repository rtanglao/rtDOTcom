## Pontifications

* Back in the Bryght / Drupal days I met and worked with Stewart Marshall.
* 10 years later he's doing fine and is focused: ["I solve the challenges entrepreneurs and small businesses face in maximizing value from their accounting resources."](http://stewartmarshallcpa.com/). Needless to say I highly recommend Stewart!
* Great to meet up with old friends!

* From [Short Attention Span Theatre: Reproducing Axios’ “1 Big Thing” Google Trends 2019 News In Review with {ggplot2}](https://rud.is/b/2019/12/27/short-attention-span-theatre-reproducing-axios-1-big-thing-google-trends-2019-news-in-review-with-ggplot2/)  I gather you can do [ggridges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) fka ```ggjoy``` ([previous ggjoy blog post)](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/10/p1-faceted-daynumber-sixhundred-colurs-r-ggjoy-joyplot-with-colours-and-fill-colour/) with ```geom_area```! I had no idea!

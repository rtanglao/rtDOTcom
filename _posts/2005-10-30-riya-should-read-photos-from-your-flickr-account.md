title: " Riya should read photos from your flickr account"

<p>I already have 20, 000 photos in two flickr accounts. It would be cooler if <a href="http://www.riya.com/">Riya</a> read my existing flickr photos (with my permission of course) and auto-tagged them. The true value of Riya is in its auto-tagging and facial recognition not in re-inventing flickr, <i>nicht wahr</i>?</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/10/26/riya-prepares-to-launch-alpha/">First Screen Shots of Riya</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>The process starts with registration and choosing a privacy setting on your pictures. You then download a client application that uploads photos you choose to include in Riya. The actual uploading takes a while - about 4 hours for each GB of photos. Instead of waiting around, Riya will email you when the process is complete.
</p>
<p>That's when the fun starts. In my case about 400 pictures were uploaded. I was presented with a view of facial thumbnails of everyone in my photos. Riya asks that you begin to educate it by telling it who the people are-it then very quickly starts to auto-tag pictures with a surprising level of accuracy.
</p>
<p>Riya also recognizes text in photos, and lets you select any area of a photo and tag that as well. For instance, you could select just the Eiffel Tower in a photo and tag it as such. Within moments, everything of importance in all of my photos was tagged. And more importantly, it was searchable.
</p>
<p>It's an easy step to allow friends to also tag and search your photos (if you choose), and even allow full public search.
</p>
<p>Linking these two features - massively automated tagging of everything in photos, with search, is compelling to say the least. The folks at Riya call it "tag locally, search globally".</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 27, 2022 21:14  [Knowing and Doing: November 2022 Archives](https://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2022-11.html#e2022-11-27T09_38_28.htm) <-- QUOTE: Several people in my feed posted, boosted, and retweeted a link to [this DEV Community article](https://dev.to/bitsrfr/getting-started-with-the-mastodon-api-41jj), which walks readers through the process of posting a status update using curl or Python. Everything worked exactly as advertised, with one small change: the Developers link that used to be in the bottom left corner of one's Mastodon home page is now a Development link on the Preferences page.

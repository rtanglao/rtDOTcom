Happy belated Canada Day and happy July 4th to my American cousins.

I am still here. Just took a wee bit of a blogging rest.
</p><p>
Had a nice conversation with <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy Abramson</a> at <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon IV</a>. He told me nicely that <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/06/24/n91-review-part-5-no-850mhz-support-means-no-gprs-data-in-san-francisco">my 850 Mhz post </a>was bogus :-) (and pointed me to a  <a href="http://www.mopocket.com/international/#000202">nice explanatory mopocket post about the cingular walled garden</a>: "Basically this means that if Cingular does not recognize your phones International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number then you can't use things like MobiTV, Rabble and a host of other applications that companies that are on deck with Cingular have sent me to try but would not install. Your phone must be a Cingular branded phone which means the phones IMEI number will be registered with Cingular. ")!

My summary: it's more the fact that the carriers know exactly what phone you are running (and the N91 is unsupported and unknown to North American carriers as was the N70 and 7610  for the most part) and know you are roaming so they can turn off your GPRS data based on that aaargh!

There is hope. The WiFi stack on the N91 is verrrrrrryyyyyyy 1.0. It crashes and is less than a 100% reliable. However it works well when it works. If every phone had WiFi and every place had WiFi (as do most of the places I hang out in like home, the <a href="http://bryght.com/">Bryght</a> offices, and <a href="http://www.take5cafe.com/index.html">Take 5</a>) and if Skype or a SIP client works reliably over WiFi, then it won't matter that the carriers will only let me do voice calls (and not data with "unsupported" handsets like the N91). Lots of "ifs" but it's coming. Mark my words. 5 years from now making voice calls over WiFi will be painless and something everybody does not just some early adopters!

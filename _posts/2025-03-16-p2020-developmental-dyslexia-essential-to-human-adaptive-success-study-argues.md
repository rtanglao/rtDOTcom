Cambridge: Helen Taylor, PhD, Martin David Vestergaard, PhD:: Developmental dyslexia essential to human adaptive success, study,  Developmental Dyslexia: Disorder or Specialization in Exploration?, argues](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/developmental-dyslexia-essential-to-human-adaptive-success-study-argues) <-- QUOTE: `Cambridge researchers studying cognition, behaviour and the brain have concluded that people with dyslexia are specialised to explore the unknown.

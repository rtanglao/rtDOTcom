I don’t really like the design of most mirrors, and the others are quite small and don’t give much detail. You also have to frequently look at the mirror, which is sometimes difficult if you’re riding a tough stretch of road. The Varia gives you audio warnings and shows traffic much further away – it really is system you can switch on and forget about. ... I still look around me though. When I see a car come up behind me, I keep an eye on my bike computer to see where and how fast it is approaching. Depending on where I’m riding, I wait until the icon reaches a certain point (about 25m away) and look around to show the driver that I’ve recognised them and see how they act. I can then decide on how to respond.`

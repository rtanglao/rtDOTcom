At 2MB per 4 megapixel image, I guess that would be approximately 500 photos.  Aargh.  I guess either I need a super duper Flickr Pro account, or I have to only selectively upload some photos or upload at at lower resolution.  Thinking on what to do! <strong>LATER</strong>: In the meantime, you can check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/">my photos on Flickr</a> and rest assured, I will be uploading lots in November when I once more can upload another gigabyte.

* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) Aug 13, 2021. [Fragment: Tools of Production – ggalt and encircling scatterplot points in R and Python](https://blog.ouseful.info/2021/08/13/fragment-tools-of-production-ggalt/) <--- geom_encircle() looks great to circle photos average colour?!? also geom_lollipop and dumbell! both look useful! Must try more R ggplot2 plotting stuff!
* My off the cuff idea is of course to plot the average colours of my flickr photos and Vancouver flickr photos over time and then encircle them with `geom_encircle()`
  * i.e. Circle the purple photos in purple, the blue photos in blue, etc :-)

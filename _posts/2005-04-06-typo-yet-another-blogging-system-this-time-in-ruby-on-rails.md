<p>Excellent. The Ruby on Rails juggernaut of apps continues.  For hackers only at this point or power users who don't need a web interface.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">typo - Trac</a>. (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/">John Gruber's linked list</a>):</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote<p>>Typo is an absolutely minimal weblogging engine which comes without an admin interface. Its configured the first time you start it using a simple web form and after that you use it by posting from a rich desktop client application like MarsEdit or similar ( see below for a list of compatible clients ).</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

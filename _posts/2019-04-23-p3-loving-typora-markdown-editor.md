title: "Loving the Typora Markdown Editor"

# Pontifications

* I'm sure I'll find some nits :-) but at the moment, loving [Typora](https://typora.io/) on Windows for editing Markdown which, unlike the current version of IA Writer, Typora reads and writes to Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) files.
* The current version of  IA Writer, 1.1,  hangs when reading and writing WSL files; I'm sure the IA Writer folks will fix it quickly since Windows 10 build 1903 with support for writing to WSL files from the Windows side will go GA in a month or two.

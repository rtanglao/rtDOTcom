[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jul 14, 2024 21:38 [GitHub - h2non/imaginary: Fast, simple, scalable, Docker-ready HTTP microservice for high-level image processing](https://github.com/h2non/imaginary?tab=readme-ov-file) <-- **QUOTE**: `imaginary uses internally libvips, a powerful and efficient library written in C for fast image processing which requires a low memory footprint and it's typically 4x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings or Go native image package, and in some cases it's even 8x faster processing JPEG images.` <-- not sure i believe these bold claims and in my case having no CLI option makes it awkward. The blur, fit, watermark, flop, zoom, thumbnail look interesting but i doubt i'll switch from the venerable imagemagick :-) Oh and I've used lipvips and it's harder to use than imagemagick because it doesn't have as much of an ecosystem around it and i'm old :-) or something!

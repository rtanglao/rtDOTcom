## Pontifications

My friend and like me, one of the former Bryght co-founders, [Boris Mann](http://www.bmannconsulting.com/), wrote ([Boris claims it was just verbal](https://twitter.com/bmann/status/811332484155600896) but I don't believe him, I believe it's on a hard drive somewhere in the "cloud" :-) !) in 2005 (or was it 2006? or 2004?) about [URLs for places like Stanley Park](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/811332141577404416) and in 2016 it's now becoming a reality with AR/MR, Bluetooth beacons etc. 

Boris we need a real blog post in 2016 with an update! Please write it!

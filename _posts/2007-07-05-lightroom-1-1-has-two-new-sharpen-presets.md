I know nothing about sharpening. So I will read this blog post about Lightroom 1.1 sharpening very carefully and try the new presets (and playing around with the sliders of course!).

Perhaps the easiest way to get started is to use either of the two new Sharpen presets found in the Develop module Presets panel (Develop presets are also available via the Library module Quick Develop panel). These two presets can be a useful starting point when learning how to sharpen in Lightroom 1.1. All you have to do is decide which of these two settings is most applicable to the image you are about to sharpen.

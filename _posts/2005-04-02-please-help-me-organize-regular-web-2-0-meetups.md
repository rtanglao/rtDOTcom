<p>Yup, wanted to do this for a long time!
<a href="http://blog.larixconsulting.com/">Tris</a>, <a href="http://www.hopstudios.com/"><strike>Suzie</strike>Susie and Travis</a>, love your help (or anybody else's) organizing this. Off the top of my head:</p>
<ul><li>Topics: Anything business or tech related about Web 2.0</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/204">Web 2.0</a> includes for me: <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aunofficial&q=identity+2.0&btnG=Search&meta=">Identity 2.0</a>, RSS and the general topics of syndication and aggregation, blogs,  Wikis, social software like flickr which to me is social photo blogging, the web as a platform, etc.</li>
<li>Not on the same night as the Vancouver Webloggers Meetup or <a href="http://www.beercasting.com/shows/vac-squad/">Beercasting</a> obviously</li>
<li>Once a month initially, perhaps twice a month later
</li><li>At a pub? Or maybe at a neutral place like a library so somebody can give a short (30 minute presentation or some lightning talks; I love lightning talks!)?
</li></ul>
<p>If you have any ideas or want to help organize this, leave a comment or email roland AT bryght.com

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Darren wanted me to start running a Business Blogger Meetup. I'm involved in too many things already to run with this, but I would certainly attend on occasion. Actually, I continue to hate the term "blog" -- I would suggest NOT labelling it "business blogger": it's too short sighted and too limiting. Maybe we'll call it a "Web 2.0 Meetup" -- inclusive of technology and business? I guess that means I'm nominating Roland or Suzie and Travis to run it. Or Tris, but that means he has to fly over to Vancouver every month.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

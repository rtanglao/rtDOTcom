[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 28, 2024. 08:53  [Matt Dancho's ggalign example R script has some fun colours and graphs](https://github.com/business-science/free_r_tips/blob/master/088_ggalign/088_ggalign.R). Just need a dataset with floating point numbers between -1 and +1 or something :-) --> **QUOTE**: `Hey Roland, This new R package is wild for making heatmaps. It's called ggalign. ... I used it to help me visualize the Top 50 US Stocks for annual return correlation and cumulative log returns. My crazy stock heatmap uses: - Dendrograms: For x and y alignment into 5 correlation buckets ... - Heatmap: For correlation similarity inside buckets ... - Bar Plot: For exposing the cumulative stock returns (shocker, NVDA is an outlier)`

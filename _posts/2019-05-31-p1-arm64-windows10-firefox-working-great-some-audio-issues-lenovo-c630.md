* Firefox [Nightly](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/firefox-69.0a1.en-US.win64-aarch64.installer.exe) ([ARM64 Windows 10 announcement](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/04/11/firefox-beta-for-windows-10-on-qualcomm-snapdragon-always-connected-pcs-now-available/)) on ARM 64 Windows 10 is working great so far.
* Have had a few issues with audio drivers but I'm not sure if that's a Firefox bug.

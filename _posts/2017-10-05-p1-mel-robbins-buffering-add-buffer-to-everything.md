title: "Mel Robbins -- buffering: top 3 things/day 50% more time; every 15 minutes of meetings, 5mins to process; create space between you and people who deplete you; make 1 decision that will help future you; consider dropping those things you wouldn't try to get involved in if you weren't already doing them"

## Pontifications

* [Mel Robbins on Buffering](https://mel-robbins.mykajabi.com/p/31-sessions-buffering): (via internal Mozilla slack channel):
    * every 15 minutes of meeting, 5 minutes to process
    * 50% more time to do top 3 things of the day
    * create space between you and people especially people who deplete you
    * make 1 decision today that will help future you
    * make a list of everything you are involved in at work and in the community. if you weren't already involved in this, how hard would you try to get involved?

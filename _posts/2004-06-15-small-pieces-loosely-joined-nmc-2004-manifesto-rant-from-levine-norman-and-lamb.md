This is the piece that inspired <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/06/15/decentralists_rule_in_10_years_or_so_aka_i_am_an_nmc_2004_fencesitter">my last post</a>.  Can't wait to see their presentation on Thursday afternoon at UBC!

From <a href="http://careo.elearning.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SmallPiecesLooselyJoined/AboutSmallPieces">UBCWiki: SmallPiecesLooselyJoined/AboutSmallPieces</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Colloboration via the net does not necessarilty require monolithic, expensive tool suites that aim to do everything under one umbrella. We will share and demonstrate the use of readily available, mostly free, discrete sets of "small" and "loosely joined" technologies - weblogs, wikis, instant messaging, audio/video chat. The loose joining means that how they are connected are not necessarily in the programming of the software, but the ways people can use them in a social context that is an environment of dynamic, changing relationships and connections, rather than the rigid, limited ones defined by computer code.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

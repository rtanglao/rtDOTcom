* Zack's blog post: [croc: Fast, simple, and secure file transfer between any two computers.](https://schollz.com/blog/croc6/)
* Code and docs: [https://github.com/schollz/croc]( https://github.com/schollz/croc ) 
* It requires a public relay server which is $40-50 a month. See this croc github issue: [This project needs your help again #453](https://github.com/schollz/croc/issues/453)    
* There are so many of these nifty command line tools! e.g. rg: grep in rust

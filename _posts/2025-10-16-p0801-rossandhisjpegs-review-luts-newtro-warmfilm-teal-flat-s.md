## QUOTE

>“NEWTRO” by Kotaro Kumazawa - this one is my go to for everyday-shoot and portraits. The color profile is close to what my eyes see, with lifted blacks. I set the opacity at around 60-70%.

>“Warm Film” by EJAY - though meant for VLOG, I use this one quite a lot when shooting well-lit environments with a lot of whites in the scene. It warms the scene up in a harmonious way. I also like the way it expresses skin tone. Again, play around with the opacity. I usually stack it on top of a Rec709 LUT set to 10% opacity.

>“Teal Flat-S” by LUMIX - kind of a fun one. I usually use it at night. It makes the yellows really pop.

>“Leica Monochrome” - my go-to for black and white!

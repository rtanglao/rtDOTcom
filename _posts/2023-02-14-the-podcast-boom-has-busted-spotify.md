    * [How Spotify's podcast bet went wrong](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/12/2023/how-spotifys-podcast-bet-went-wrong) --> QUOTE: `Spotify was a one-company podcast bubble. Its drastic cuts have triggered a podcast winter, as the small studios it helped support consolidate and lavish narrative productions wane. But rivals from tech giants Amazon and Apple to the radio company iHeart have found better returns on more cautious bets. Spotify’s pivot has more in common with the recent cuts to Hollywood’s spending on streaming television.`
* Spotify's "podcasts" are not really podcasts but I think the collapse has started for sure.

# Pontifications

* Emma Humphries [WONTFIX](https://emmas.site/blog/2020/04/09/not-a-defect) is great. If you post an ad hominin attack or threaten folks, your entire post should be hidden and/or deleted and in bugzilla it will be at least hidden.
* Previously relevant in the case of "non ad hominin attack" rants that also  have constructive feedback: 
  * 2019: [Hey Tyee Commenters! Scholars Studied You. Hereâ€™s What They Found <-- leads me to believe there's something to  'de-ranting' i.e. only displaying ranting language to the 'original  ranter', everybody else only sees the constructive language](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/11/07/p1-tyee-comments-no-insults-de-ranting/)
  * 2018: [De-ranting: Making non constructive feedback visible only to the person who posted it](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/06/27/p1-remove-insults-rants-non-constructive-feedback/)

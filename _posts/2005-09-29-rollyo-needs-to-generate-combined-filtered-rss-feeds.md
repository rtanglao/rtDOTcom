<p>Hmmm. <a href="http://www.rollyo.com/">Rollyo</a> is cool (combine several Yahoo search feeds, and filter what you want), but it would be a lot cooler if you could get a RSS feed of the combined, filtered feed! Anyways, this is not (YET) a business model but rather a cool feature methinks. What Rollyo does could be done with the built in <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> 4.7 aggregator module and a tiny bit of code (use a regular expression to filter on the title and description of each RSS item, so simple even I could code it!). So in other words: Rollyo coming to a Drupal 4.7 site near you real soon now :-) ! The relentless commodification of open source continues.</p>

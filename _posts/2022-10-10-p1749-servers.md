[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 10, 2022 17:49 [I wish my web server were in the corner of my room (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers) <-- I wish that as well but dynamic DNS, security updates, etc :-) I would love to buy a box and a service that somehow takes these difficulties magically out of home hosting! I did run Apache on Windows NT in the 1999 and early 2000s and it was 'difficult'. <-- QUOTE: 

>Perhaps there’s a way to host my website at home, but have the static bits served by Cloudflare if the Raspberry Pi isn’t available (using a global CDN as a UPS), and the dynamic bits always visit my home – but there’s a graceful “come back later” message if the Pi is down?

>I’m pretty technically capable but I’m not sure I can be bothered.

>There are so many things in the way. Getting a routable IP address at home. Making it secure. Monitoring it. Gracefully stepping up and down from the CDN.

>I would love a turnkey way to home-host.

>Here’s the BIG question: even if it works as above, it’s still a bit of a hacky compromise to have my web server sitting on a shelf. How could it be easier than a monthly rental fee for cloud hosting? How could it be extra? Sure, ambient beats playing into my home office when somebody visits this blog… but what else? There’s a project here.

## Pontifications

* Like [Indian Horse](http://www.indianhorse.ca/), [Métis Mutt](https://buzzon.com/index.php/reviews/31166-metis-mutt) is gut wrenching and a must see eye opener about the unacceptable history and current reality of the folks who were here first! Highly recommended! We saw it in Charlottetown on September 1st!

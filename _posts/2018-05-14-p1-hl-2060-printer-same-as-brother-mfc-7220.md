**QUOTE**

<blockquote>
After a long, frustrating search, I finally found a clue in an obscure post somewhere in the Ubuntu forums, hinting that CUPS actually comes with a driver that works with the MFC-7220. It appears that the printer part of MFC-7220 is identical to Brother's HL-2060 printer; so all I had to do, was to uninstall the MFC-7220 drivers, delete the printer from the CUPS web interface, and then re-add the printer and select the HL-2060 driver for the printer. After this very non-obvious choice of printer driver, the printer started to work perfectly again.

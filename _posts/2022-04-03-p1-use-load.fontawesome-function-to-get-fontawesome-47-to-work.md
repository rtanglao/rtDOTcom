* [Discovered Apr 3, 2022. 17:20](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog) SO:[Can't use font awesome in R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46978992/cant-use-font-awesome-in-r) aka how to get fontawesome 4.7 to work<-- From this SO question, I had to use `load.fontawesome()` to get my previous blog post to work: [Use fontawesome to display awesome characters for Firefox support tags (antivirus, operating system, certificates, addons, etc) but currently the R fontawesome package only supports fontawesome 4.7 even though the current version is version 5 and 6 is in beta](http://rolandtanglao.com/2022/01/19/p1-use-fontawesome-version-4.7-since-r-package-does-not-support-fontawesome-5-or-6/)

## The working R Code

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(emojifont)
load.fontawesome()

## Generate some data
DF <- data.frame(x=1:5, y=1:5)

ggplot(DF, aes(x=x, y=y)) + 
     geom_text(label=fontawesome(c('fa-check-circle', 'fa-linux', 'fa-meetup', 'fa-github', 'fa-eur')), 
               family='fontawesome-webfont', 
               size=seq(6, 14, 2))
```

title: " Feed readers don't have features 'humans' want like rating, interlinking,
  filtering, auto-correlation because only programmers"

Rant du jour! I want these features too; it will happen, either wait until <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent</a> or <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/">Nick</a> does it (they will) or write your own or start a project and find a developer and pay him/her to  write it driven by your design for humans! Seize the feed!

From <a href="http://www.glassdog.com/archives/2004/08/25/whats_wrong_with_feed_readers.html">glassdog: &quot;What's Wrong With: Feed Readers&quot;</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Where are the extrapolations, based on the data? Where is Bayesian filtering? Why isn&#8217;t there auto-correlation between like items? Why isn&#8217;t there sorting by link popularity? Or inter-linking between feeds? Why can&#8217;t I rank feeds or categories higher than others? Why can&#8217;t I rate items and let the cumulative ratings over time determine feed rankings? Why isn&#8217;t there some statistical combination of each of the above to put what I&#8217;m actually going to care about at the top of the list and the discussions about which syndication protocol is best at the bottom? Why isn&#8217;t there an archive, to throw useful-but-read items somewhere other than the to-do list and trash? Why can&#8217;t I synchronize state information to a server, so I can read feeds at home without having to re-read them the next morning at work? (Dear BlogLines users: shut up. Web apps suck.) Why can&#8217;t I automatically delete any item which references the same links as the current item? Why is the desire for any of this a surprise?

Why? Because so far only programmers have written feed readers. Actual humans are no where to be found.

The linear programmer mindset has invaded the user model &#8212; something that never happens &#8212; and as a result feed readers haven&#8217;t evolved beyond a way to more efficiently plow through all available information. Of course you can&#8217;t skip anything! That would be non-linear!</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

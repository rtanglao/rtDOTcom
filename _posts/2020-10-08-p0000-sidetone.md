"So how about this:

    when you start a new Google Doc, you set a collaboration time a the top: an hour, a week, whatever
    the toolbar shows the current quarter: 1, 2, 3, or 4. People know if it’s time to chat and get alignment on goals, or time to finesse and wordsmith.
    in the toolbar, there’s an animated progress bar that shows how long is left till the end of the current quarter. That provides the urgency.

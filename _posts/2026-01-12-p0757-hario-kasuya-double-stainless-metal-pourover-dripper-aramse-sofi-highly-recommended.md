title: "Things that Work: Hario Tetsuya Kasuya Double Stainless All Metal Pourover Dripper with Aramse Sofi Top and holder. Best pourover coffee ever :-) !"
---
1. Place the [Hario Double Stainless Dripper・KASUYA Model](https://global.hario.com/kasuya_model/kdd.html)on top of your coffee cup or carafe and add your ground coffee.
2. Place the Aramse [Sofi](https://aramse.coffee/products/sofi) [holder](https://aramse.coffee/products/sofi-holder) on top of the Tetsuya dripper and then place the top part of the Aramse Sofi brewer on top of the stand
3. Use your favourite pourover method. The Armase Sofi top part acts as a shower head. No need for a fancy pourover kettle.

No plastic! And super coffee with no fines.
Disclaimer: I have no interest financially or otherwise in Hario or Aramse. Love them both!

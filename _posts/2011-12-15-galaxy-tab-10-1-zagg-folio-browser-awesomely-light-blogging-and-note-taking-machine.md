<p>The Zagg Folio keyboard case for the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is great for editing (e.g. Google Sites or blogging on your Drupal or Wordpres site with WYSIWYG editor turned off). A fun, light way to blog on the road without having to carry a laptop. Better than a bottom of the line MacBook Air? No but a lighter and viable and slightly cheaper alternative. Recommended!</p>

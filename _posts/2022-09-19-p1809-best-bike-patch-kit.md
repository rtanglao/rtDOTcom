[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Sep 19, 2022 18:09  [Build a Bike Patch and Flat Kit in 2022 ¦ Reviews by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-bike-patch-kit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=RSS%20Feed) <-- QUOTE: `If you own a bike, you need a flat-fixing kit. It’s really that simple. Sure, maybe you’ll get lucky and get a flat close to a shop, or the buses will be running on time for once, but even with all that going for you, getting stranded across town will cost you time, money, and precious sanity. You can put together a great kit in less time than it takes to read this guide.` <-- The pump and tire levers and bag recommendations sound great.

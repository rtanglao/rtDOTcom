title: "Stephen Downes: There's no one best way to learn computer programming"
---

## Pontifications
* How does Stephen do this? Since I learned about him in the early 2000s he's been concisely and beautifully summarizing things over at downes.ca at [oldaily](https://www.downes.ca/index.html). Amazing body of work this alone! But wait there's more! He gives talks and he writes essays on his [half an hour blogspot blog](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/).
* "This is a really good but conceptually difficult essay with an important point to make: there's no one best way to teach computer programming. There's no natural ordering of concepts from foundational to advanced." <--- read Stephen's summary post, [Programming Paradigms and Beyond](https://www.downes.ca/post/68266)  AND [the whole PDF](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kf-prog-paradigms-and-beyond/paper.pdf) .

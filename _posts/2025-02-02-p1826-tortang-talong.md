My parents cooked this dish almost every week at home, and I honestly never bothered to try it until I caved one day (one of my best decisions by far). ...A simple dish, but it’s one of the best ways to really showcase the flavor and versatility of the eggplant. It’s the main reason why eggplant had quickly become my favorite vegetable!` <-- See also: [Jacqui Mackenzie:: Tortang Talong (Filipino Eggplant Omelet)](https://food52.com/recipes/23933-tortang-talong-filipino-eggplant-omelet)

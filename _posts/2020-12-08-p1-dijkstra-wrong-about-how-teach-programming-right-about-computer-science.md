* See my previous related posts which are basically Mark Guzdial again :-) :

  * [Computing Education Research Blog:Task-specific programming languages: People aren’t dumb. Programming is hard.](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/08/08/p1-people-are-not-dumb-programming-languages-are-hard/)        
*   [Dijkstra’s Truths about Computing Education Aren’t The many kinds of programming](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/12/07/dijkstras-truths-about-computing-education-are-mostly-wrong/):  <-- “Of course, there are innate differences between people, but that fact  doesn’t have to limit who can program. Computers are the most flexible  medium that humans have ever created. To argue that only a small  percentage of people can “groove with programming” or that learning a  specific programming language “mentally mutilates” is to define  programming in a very narrow way. There are *lots* of activities that are programming” <-- AMEN!

Time and money require privilege and wealth;  Federico Viticci:: The AI App Experience Matters More Than Benchmarks Now - MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/notes/the-ai-app-experience-matters-more-than-benchmarks-now/) <-- **QUOTE**: `Which brings me to my takeaway: from my perspective, despite a stronger baseline, there is still no single LLM that “does it all” these days. Beyond my nerdy experiments, I generally alternate between two modes: Claude for most work-related tasks, and either ChatGPT or Perplexity for web search. The combination of these two modalities gives me everything I need from modern LLMs, and it provides me with the mix of performance, design, and app integrations I like best. ... Ultimately, choosing between any LLM at the frontier of AI right now is a highly subjective matter that comes down to cost, workflow, app ecosystem, design, and, yes, pure “vibes”. Personally, I try to avoid fixating on benchmarks and instead prioritize these qualities in my decisions`

## Pontifications
* Former colleague Katharine Bailey and current AI maven at Accenture continues her fabulous explanations of 'AI' to newbies like myself.
* In [A.I. and the Future of Work](https://medium.com/@katherinebailey/a-i-and-the-future-of-work-e18653d1636d?fbclid=IwAR0ADV0MMw8FS6G9EwtTGL9jRnVPPTaZ4NHBIBdiWRmHYPdXAtb99AEwXC8) she writes how AI leads to more jobs for humans:

**QUOTE**

<blockquote>

Many companies working in the AI space today are at pains to make clear that these technologies are about augmenting human intelligence, not about machine intelligence replacing humans. This may seem like a PR platitude to avoid coming across like they’re in the business of putting people out of a job, but it’s actually more than that. The type of AI that’s being used today, i.e. Machine Learning, doesn’t just augment humans, it requires them.

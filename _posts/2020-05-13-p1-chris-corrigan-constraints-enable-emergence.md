# Pontifications

* Alicia Juarerro's main points according to Chris Corrigan:

  * "Nature uses constraints to generate emergence and sustain it. Constraints both limit and enable.
  * Evolution selects for resilience, adaptability, and evolvability.
  * Resilience is sustained by micro-diversity.
  * Ecosystems are sustained by distributed control rather than governing control. The key is in the links.
  * The emergence of novel practices – innovation – cannot be caused, but novelty can be enabled. You do this by catalyzing conditions that allow innovation to occur.
  * Think of constraints as phenomena that change the likelihood of things, and the probabilities of what is going on." <-- read the whole thing [Chris Corrigan: Constraints that enable emergence](www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/constraints-that-enable-emergence/) and if you want more [Professor Juarerro's 27 minute video](https://vimeo.com/128934608) seems like a good place to start

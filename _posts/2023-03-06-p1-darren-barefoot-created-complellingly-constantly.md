title: "Darren, thank you for your creating compellingly constantly!"
---
* Vancouver has lost one of its most compelling creators: [Darren Barefoot](https://darrenbarefoot.com/). See his last blog post: [They were all splendid](https://darrenbarefoot.com/2023/02/25/they-were-all-splendid/)
* We in the tech community in Vancouver, Ireland, and beyond were lucky to have intersected with Darren and his life and work.
* I was privileged enough to have hung out with DB (and fabulous partner Julie) at the Northern Voice blogging conference and to be a co-organizer and attend so many NV meetings with him. So many great memories, so many great DB blog posts and words. e.g. May 2, 2016: [Why marketers need to become inventors](https://capulet.com/2016/05/02/2016-5-2-why-marketers-need-to-become-inventors/)
    * "I like to think my friend Roland [invented content strategy](http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/07/31/anil-its-not-about-seo-its-about-creating-compelling-content-constantly/) in the early 2000’s when he described his Four C’s: create compelling content constantly. Content strategy has, of course, been added to our long list of online marketing activities — media relations, SEO, email marketing, social media and so forth — that everyone does. We have to do these things just to keep up with our competitors. I call these ongoing daily marketing activities “heartbeats,” because they’re constant, reliable and they keep an organization’s outreach alive."
* Thanks DB. I miss you!

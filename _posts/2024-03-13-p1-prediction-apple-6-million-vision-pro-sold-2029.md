* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) Mar 12, 2024 18:03 [Asa Dotzler on FB predicts that by March 11, 2029, Apple will have sold less than six million Vision Pros](https://www.facebook.com/asadotzler/posts/pfbid02CSE4uf6oY4cDYeCqhu8RgL6pBYSSrNQEvJPhzYQ5GkzGKUc5hwze2SPuX1Q1k5ddl) <-- Probably wrong :-) prediction on my part: Asa is right! <-- **QUOTE**: `If, in 5 years, Apple has 1/10th of them using Vision Pro, I'll eat some hat I have yet to purchase. That is, if 10% of Apples most fervent 60 million, or 6 million users, by all these wild and probably incorrect estimates above, jump on the VR bandwagon, then please call me out and link this post. (That's giving Apple 5 years to catch up to Meta's current active users.)`

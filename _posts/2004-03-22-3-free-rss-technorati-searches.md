Awesome, thanks! Now if you could only do wild card URL searches like <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a>'s <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/news/archives/000020.html">referenced URI</a> feature e.g. give me an RSS feed of all blogs that have links with rolandtanglao.com in them. That way I can see if anybody links anywhere on a site rather than to just a single URL  i.e. anybody who links to a page anywhere on rolandtanglao.com

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I'm proud to announce the new Technorati redesign has launched, available at www.technorati.com. Some highlights of the new design:

Three free email or RSS watchlists for individuals - all you have to do is sign up as a member. Of course, people who have paid for watchlists are grandfathered in as well.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

title: Vanmoof "Boncho" aka Bike Poncho - first impressions

## Pontifications

* tl;dr - Love [the Vanmoof Boncho](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boncho/boncho-the-bike-poncho) except for the fact that it doesn't have a place for lights ([Vanmoof Boncho link](https://www.vanmoof.com/en_us/accessories?cat=17), how to fold a Boncho).
* When it's rainy, you need lights on your handlebars and the Vanmoof Boncho hides them. Checkit:<br />

*  Feature request for Boncho 2.0: some sort of mount for lights on the outside of the boncho.
* I really need to start [my bike to work blog like I said I would 1.5 years ago](http://rolandtanglao.com/2015/04/17/2-I-think-I-will-have-to-start-a-commuter-bicycle-blog/) :-)

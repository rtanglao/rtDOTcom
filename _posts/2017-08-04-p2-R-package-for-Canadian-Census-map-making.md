## Pontifications
* From the incomparable [Jens von Bergmann](https://twitter.com/vb_jens) of [Mountainmath.ca](https://mountainmath.ca/) we are lucky to have an R package called [cancensus](https://github.com/mountainMath/cancensus) for accessing his database of Statistics Canada's Canadian Census Mapper data aka [CensusMapper](https://mountainmath.ca/mountain_math/canada_census_map). It's beta so it can change at any time! [Check out the demo!](https://censusmapper.ca/r-censusmapper-demo.html)
* Wow, thanks Jens!

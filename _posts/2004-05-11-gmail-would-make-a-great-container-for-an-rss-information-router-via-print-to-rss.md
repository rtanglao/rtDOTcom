Steve Gillmor nails it! Now does Google have the wherewithal to put a 'print to RSS' in Gmail?

From <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1589750,00.asp">Gmail Has Potential as Enterprise Platform</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>In fact, Gmail would make a great container for an RSS information router. In the same way you can print a conversation in Gmail, I suggested to Brin, you could also print to RSS. "Yeah," he said, "that's a very interesting idea."</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

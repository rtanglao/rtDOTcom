title: "USB Spellcraft: magic spell from March 20 no longer works; plugged in USB-A devices into old Anker USB 3 hub and plugged Anker hub into USB-C port of the Dell Thunderbolt 4 WD22TB4 hub"

* The USB Magic Spell from [March 20th, 2024](http://rolandtanglao.com/2024/03/20/p1-usb-spellcraft-usb-ports-not-working-sonoma-macos-144-update/) i.e. 2 days ago no longer works sad face.
* Workaround: plugged in USB-A devices into old Anker USB 3 hub and plugged Anker hub into USB-C port (using a USB-A to C converter) of the Dell WD22TB4 Thunderbolt 4 hub. macOS Sonoma 14.4 seems to have broken the USB-A ports on the Dell Thunderbird Hub but luckily the USB-C ports still work in 14.4!

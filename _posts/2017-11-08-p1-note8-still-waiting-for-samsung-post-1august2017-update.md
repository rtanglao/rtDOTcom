## Pontifications

* It's November 8, 2017 - My flagship Note 8 is still stuck at security level: August 1, 2017 which I think means no Blueborne patch! Thanks S*msung and F*do for making my >$CDN1000 phone needlessly vulnerable.
* I guess my next step is off to the Fido forums and Howard Forums. 
* No doubt other Canadians have experienced this problem sad face!

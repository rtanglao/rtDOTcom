title: "It ain't easy to be a software platform vendor: just ask Apple, Twitter, Relive, Garmin and Strava"

# Pontifications

* This thought has been in the back of my mind since July when relive was cut off: Strava cutting off relive as related in [DC Rainmaker's Strava cuts off Relive: Hereâ€™s what actually happened](https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/07/strava-relive-cc-app-platform-dispute.html#comments) has happened time and time again. You can't trust a platform vendor not to revoke your API access or to remove the  APIs your software depends on!
* Apple has done it umpteen times. So many times, I'm sure it's not possible to get an accurate count!
* [Twitter has done it a least twice.](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/16/p1-remember-the-last-two-times-twitter-wrecked-their-api/)
* I still use Apple and Twitter (fortunately or unfortunately :-)  !)
* I think I'll still use Strava even with relive.cc gone. I think I'll post to relive from Garmin but yeah it s*cks. 
* The only solution is to own your own data and to pass it directly to the silos like relive and strava that you trust, but who has time for that ? I just want to bicycle and get kudos from my friends LOL!
* [This Dave quote from 1994](http://scripting.com/davenet/1994/10/29/platformischinesehousehold.html) seems relevant:

```
"Today, Macintosh is an empty loveless house. Not a home. 
All the developers walked but left the babies behind. 
Not because of market share, that can be fixed with 
economic tweaks. We walked because Apple is a lousy lover."

title: Haskell Programming from first principles - Review of Chapter 1

## Pontifications

* I fell in love with this tutorial so I bought [the book](http://haskellbook.com/) :-) ! I think I have read at least 6 or 7 explanations of lambda calculus before but for whatever reason (writing style? the level of detail? I actually paid attention :-) ?) it clicked this time.
* Beta Reduction is difficult. I think it would have been better to completely explain [exercise 7](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/14/p1-combinator-beta-reduction-exercise/) (scroll down to "Beta Reduce on page 49") with a diagram and/or with the ":=" notation used previously. Other than that, the other exercises were explained well.

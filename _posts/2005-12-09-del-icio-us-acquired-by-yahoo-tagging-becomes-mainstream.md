<p>Not quite mainstream but this is the next step.  Coming soon to millions of Yahoo! users, tagging! Great news. Congrats to Yahoo! on acquiring yet another cool small team!</p> <p>From <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">del.icio.us: y.ah.oo!</a>.:</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>We're proud to announce that del.icio.us has joined the Yahoo! family.  Together we'll continue to improve how people discover, remember and share on the Internet, with a big emphasis on the power of community.  We're excited to be working with the Yahoo! Search team - they definitely get social systems and their potential to change the web. (We're also excited to be joining our fraternal twin Flickr!)</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

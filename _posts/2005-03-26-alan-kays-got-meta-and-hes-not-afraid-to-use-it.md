<p>Java, C++ etc. as programming pop culture and Smalltalk and Lisp as classics! Interesting point of view! And not without merit!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=printer_friendly&pid=273&page=1">A Conversation with Alan Kay</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>In fact, let's not even worry about Java. Let's not complain about Microsoft. Let's not worry about them because we know how to program computers, too, and in fact we know how to do it in a meta-way. We can set up an alternative point of view, and we're not the only ones who do this, as you're well aware.</blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

title: "Learning ethics (the real ethics not the STV100) version should be mandatory for all starting high school"

# Pontifications

* Learning ethics, the real ethics  that my son is learning in high school not the [STV100](https://uwflow.com/course/stv100) version, should be mandatory for all starting high school
* Disclaimer: I took the first offering of STV100 at the University of Waterloo back in the 80s and though I learned lots,  in retrospect, really learning ethics from the philosophy ground up to its application to technology would have been better than STV100's much more superficial treatment.

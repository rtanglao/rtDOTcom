## Pontifications

* We went to [Centum Corpora](http://littlechambermusic.com/centum-corpora/) today which was was a very meditative and fitting way to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the WWI armistice day:

**QUOTE** from their website

<blockquote>

"The Little Chamber Music Series That Could, in association with the Homegoing Brass Band, are proud to present Centum Corpora.<br /><br />

To mark the 100th anniversary of Armistice Day and the end of “the war to end all wars“, we will be placing 100 professional, student and community musicians in the Jones 45 section (enter on 41st west of Fraser) of Mountain View Cemetery, which is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission section.<br /><br />

Each musician will be representing a different fallen soldier from WW1, and will be standing behind their marker for the performance. Simple, beautiful chords will echo through the cemetery when 100 instruments musically repeat the name and date of death of their veteran 100 times, as the community walks amongst them for this unique composed sound installation (approx 25min). In the spirit of what soldiers in WW1 faced, this outdoor performance will proceed in any weather."

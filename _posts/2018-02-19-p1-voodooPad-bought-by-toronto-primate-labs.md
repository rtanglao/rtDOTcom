## Pontifications

* [VoodooPad acquired by Toronto's Primate Labs in December 2017](https://www.voodoopad.com/blog/2017/12/primate-labs-acquires-voodoopad/)
* Still want to use it for my ["real-soon-now" wiki](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/24/p1-rolandex-for-my-personal-wiki/) :-) (gotta buy a copy first)
* Hope it continues to be updated, [looks like support questions are being answered fast](http://support.primatelabs.com/discussions/voodoopad)!

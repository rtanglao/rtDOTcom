[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 2, 2023 08:17  [The future of Offpunk: UNIX command-line heaven and packaging hell](https://ploum.net/2023-10-01-future-of-offpunk-packaging-hell.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `I’m not a good developer. Anything more complex than that is too much for my taste. Unless forced, I’ve never used an IDE, never understood complex toolchains nor packaging. I modify files with (neo)vim (without any plugin), compile from the command line and run the resulting binary (not even needing the second step with python). Life is too short for making it more complex than that. I like to play with the code, not to learn tools that would do it for me.` <-- ditto, ty*anny of packing etc etc, maybe use git to make zip files??!?

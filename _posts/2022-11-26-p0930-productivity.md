[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 26, 2022 09:30 [Massively increase your productivity on personal projects with comprehensive documentation and automated tests](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/) <-- QUOTE: `With issue driven development you don’t have to remember anything about any of these projects at all. ...I’ve had issues where I did a bunch of design work in issue comments, then dropped it, then came back 12 months later and implemented that design—without having to rethink it. ...I’ve had projects where I forgot that the project existed entirely! But I’ve found it again, and there’s been an open issue, and I’ve been able to pick up work again.` <-- love this issue driven approach, maybe i should adopt this for my personal hobbyist projects !!!!

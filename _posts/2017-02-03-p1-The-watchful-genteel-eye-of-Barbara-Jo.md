title: What are you going to miss when Barbara-jo's Books to Cooks closes in 25 days? I'll miss Barbara-jo's genteel presence and watchful eye

## Pontifications

* What will you miss when [Barbara-jo's Books to Cooks](http://www.bookstocooks.com/) [closes on February 28, 2017](http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=448aa9fd599f08ed28b38ec8a&id=6440777843)?
* I'll  miss her genteel presence, fantastic curated selection of books and the fab staff when Barb (my wife Barb, not Barbara-jo :-)!) worked there.
* Above all, I'll miss the fantastic atmosphere at one of the fabulous cookbook events: take a great cookbook, add a great chef (often the author or local celebrity chef!) cooking recipes from the book and a cozy atmosphere and it adds up to magic all under Barbara-jo's watchful eye!

More shaky backlight video from the fantastic combo of the E75, Qik and 3.5G. this time mobile and web related pontifications from <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">Boris Mann</a> of <a href="http://bootuplabs.com/">Bootup Labs</a> (and fellow co-founder of Bryght). Check out the video after the jump or read my stream of consciousness pseudo-transcript :-) !
<ol>
<li>Please port Maemo to Qik, and Nokia please buy Qik; just like <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/07/26/nokia-buy-shozu-and-be-done-with-it">Nokia should have bought ShoZu</a> :-)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.miss604.com/2010/04/back-online-for-now.html">Miss604's Denial of Service of Attack</a></li>
<li>Bryght - the first hosted Drupal, first Drupal as a service, 5 years ago</li>
<li>Bryght partnership with <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/">Workhabit</a> - 50 servers, Cisco routers, pre cloud, we had DOS
attacks and Workhabit's awesome <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/users/gary">Gary</a>, <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/users/aaron">Aaron</a> and <a href="http://www.workhabit.com/users/jonathan">Jonathan</a> fixed the routers</li>
<li>DOS cannot be fixed completely but it can be minimized through various means including taking out the DOS IP addresses at the router level, taking your site down is not a solution, shows
that real hosting companies need to own their infrastructure or have DNS separated</li>
<li><a href="http://www.drupalgardens.com/">Drupal Gardens</a> aka "Bryght done right" aka "Bryght in the cloud is <a href="http://acquia.com/blog/minimizing-maintenance-time-while-updating-thousands-drupal-gardens-sites">not using Aegir</a></li>
<li>But Drupal Gardens does use Drush</li>
<li>Bryght didn't use Drush, we used python for lots of historical reasons
To upgrade 1000 Drupal sites e.g. from Drupal 5.1 to Drupal 5.2 sites I ran hmupdate.py (or was it hmupgrade.py? it's fuzzy now!) in a for loop over  the 1000
Bryght Drupal web sites</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.drupal.org/aegir-hosting-system">Aegir</a> has commoditized Bryght (former Bryght guy, <a href="http://drupal.org/user/1337">Adrian Rossouw</a>,
developed Aegir; Adrian rocks)</li>
<li>The entire Bryght Drupal as a service is available in a box i.e. commoditized</li>
<li>The awesome <a href="http://www.emmajane.net/about">Emma Jane Hogbin</a> has advocated a web infrastructure e.g. a Drupal cloud for every town</li>
<li>A Drupal cloud for every town is a way to attract businesses because
you can spin up a free (government pays for it, far better than bogus tax breaks) scalable, modern, SEO optimised website for a business or non profit
in 5 minutes</li>
<li>Dreamweaver doesn't cut it - Technologists have failed because there
is still no Dreamweaver for 21st century but wordpress.com is close and Acquia Gardens when it's 1.0 will be even closer</li>
<li>Does <a href="http://qik.com">Qik</a> have a business model? Yes bundling with handset
</li>
<li>Schmap is annoying and irrelevant
</li>
<li>Iphone 4.0 is highly relevant :-)
</li><li>Apple Gaming network is huge - Could <a href="http://tinyspeck.com/">Tiny Speck</a> use it for <a href="http://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>? Yes! How
porous will Apple make it? i.e. will it play nice with other social networking sites? probably not in the near term but maybe in the long term</li>
<li>iAds - based on HTML5! Big ! Will make HTML5 "the voice of the new web
dev generation"</li>
<li>Multi-tasking - it doesn't matter, it comes down to UX; area where
Nokia is lost (except possibly Maemo! go Maemo go! p.s. I hate the
name Meego much prefer Maemo!)</li>
<li>User Experience of multi-tasking is what's important and having to
install a 3rd party task manager to make Symbian multi-tasking work is a really,
really bad user experience</li>
<li>Yet another shout-out to <a href="http://twitter.com/janole">Jan Ole Suhr</a> for the awesome <a href="http://mobileways.de/gravity">Gravity</a> Twitter App - best mobile Twitter app on ony platform, only available on Symbian for the moment
</li>
<li>Took Boris "83 clicks" to pay for Gravity, sad but true :-) ! Nokia,
please fix!</li>
<li>Maemo potential is so much greater than Apple iPhone and Symbian
because it's Linux and because it's truly open from the get go rather
than openness being bolted on like Symbian :-) !</li>

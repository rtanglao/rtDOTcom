<blockquote>

Legacy extensions were akin to kernel modules. When there is no abstraction, there can be no such thing as userspace. This is precisely the problem that WebExtensions solves!<br /><br />

...<br /><br />


* Gecko is the kernel;<br />
* WebExtensions are privileged user applications;<br />
* Web content runs as unprivileged user applications.

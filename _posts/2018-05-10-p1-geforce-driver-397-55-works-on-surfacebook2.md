## Pontifications

* [Geforce 397.55 hotfix drivers works on Surface Book 2](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1038669/geforce-drivers/surface-book-2-15-inch-cant-install-drivers-after-390-65/post/5338203/#5338203) 
* I applied 397.55 and it appears to work. So far so good!
* Hopefully the saga of "[GeForce Drivers don't support Surface Book 2 as of April 27, 2018 but they will be supported in a future update](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/28/p1-surface-book2-display-drivers-not-supported-by-geforce-but-will-be/)" is over :-)

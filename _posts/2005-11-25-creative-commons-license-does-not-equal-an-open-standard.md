<p>Ray Ozzie and Dave Winer are both gurus I respect but no matter how great the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/">Simple Sharing Extensions for RSS</a> are, <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/rayozzie/Blog/cns!1pyct_cYtbBtOBPDVAumMEdw!175.entry">putting SSE under a Creative Commons license</a> does not make them an open standard. I am very skeptical that non M*crosoft software using SSE will be first class citizens, but I would love to be proven wrong.</p>

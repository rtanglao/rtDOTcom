title: "SUMO Volunteer contribution Metadata Database for infographics"

## Pontifications

(quite similar to [Photo Metadata Database for flickr and instagram](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/09/16/p1-metadata-database-system-for-flickr-and-instagram.jpg/) )

* This is my long term goal: A "SUMO (support.mozilla.org) Volunteer contribution Metadata Database"
* The database could be mongodb or redis ! Basically anything that stores json and has a decent query language.
* Poll the volunteer API once an hour. Get all the metadata e.g. replies, date of replies, tags, does this solve the problem, etc
* Use the meta data to make infographics and visualizations (which could be turned into t-shirts) once an hour.

* We need better tools like this  and they should be built into every computer. Probably something built on Javascript, HTML and CSS that can be easily hosted by anyone for free.
* We need tools that don't involve writing arcane syntax into arcane text editors to get meaningful and useful software that is on the internet! Not just stuck in the island of your computer or phone!

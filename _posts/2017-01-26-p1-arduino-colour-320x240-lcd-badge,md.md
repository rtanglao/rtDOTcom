title: Arduino driven colour 320x240 LCD Badge using the Espressif ESP32 WROVER Kit?
---


## Pontifications

* From [Kip](https://twitter.com/kearwoodgilbert), a week ago, I found out about the [Espressif ESP32 WROVER KIT](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3384) an amazing prototyping board with an ESP32 micro controller, SD card slot, RGB LED, 4 indicator lights, WiFi, Bluetooth, 320x240 LCD Screen, USB Power!
* Perfect for prototyping a "smart" IOT badge. Wouldn't it be great to have this handed out to 1000 people at an Mozilla All Hands with preloaded All Hands stuff and Mozilla's IOT stuff on it? Would be great to see what that 1000 people  come up with!

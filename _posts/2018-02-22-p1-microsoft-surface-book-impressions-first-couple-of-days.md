## Pontifications

* What I got: [Microsoft Surface Book 2, 16 GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 13 inch](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/02/13/p1-switching-to-a-microsoft-surface-book2-for-mozilla-work/)
* Love the facial unlock. Don't need to ever type passwords.
* Love USB-C power. I am using the Apple Laptop USB-C chargers and they work perfectly except for the gratuitous message about it charging slowly! Thanks but no thanks Microsoft :-)
* Only down side is it's too thick! Don't have a sleeve or case; I thought it would fit 13" MBP sleeves but it's too thick! 
* Still haven't tried the Window Linux subsystem aka Ubuntu box :-)
* Hope I can write my blog posts using IA for Windows and the Linux subsystem

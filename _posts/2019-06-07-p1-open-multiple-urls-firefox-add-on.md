* Since [I can't get Launchy on ARM64 Windows 10 to work](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/06/06/p1-launchy-ruby-gem-does-not-launch-firefox/), I am opening multiple URLs using the following Firefox Add-on:
  * [Open Multiple URLs Firefox Add-on by Firefox user 12363525](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/open-multiple-urls/) <--- it is slower than Launchy but good enough for now.

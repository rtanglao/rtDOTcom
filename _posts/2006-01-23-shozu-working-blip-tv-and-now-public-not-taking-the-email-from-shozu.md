title: Shozu working, blip.tv and Now Public not taking the email from Shozu

<p>Well, I had to deactivate and reactivate <a href="http://shozu.com/">Shozu</a> on my N70 and now it successfully uploads both photos and videos to Shozu but unfortunately when Shozu emails the video to <a href="http://roland.blip.tv/">blip.tv</a> and <a href="http://nowpublic.com/">Now Public</a>, it's not showing up (or they are both being very slow). I know that Shozu has the video and that it emails properly because when I get Shozu to email me, I get the email with the video attachment now problem! This is weird because 3GP from my old 7610 worked fine and quite quickly via Shozu to blip.tv, perhaps blip.tv and Now Public can't handle MP4 which is the video format from the N70?</p><p>Aaargh, email is really the wrong way to do this. We need a standard video upload API. How about the<a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/atompub-charter.html"> Atom Publishing Protocol</a>?</p>

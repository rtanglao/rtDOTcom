[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Aug 14, 2022 20:18  [ME:: really :-) ?!? Latacora:: Stop Using Encrypted Email](https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/02/19/stop-using-encrypted.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `Email is unsafe and cannot be made safe. The tools we have today to encrypt email are badly flawed. Even if those flaws were fixed, email would remain unsafe. Its problems cannot plausibly be mitigated. Avoid encrypted email.` <-- the subject line and other metadata is unencrypted so good luck with encrypting email :-) and using it for private things :-)

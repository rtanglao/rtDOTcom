<p>It's as easy as "git pull". Check out my commits on my <a href="http://github.com/rtanglao/rt-d6/commits/master">public rt-d6 repository</a> if you want to see what's up on my server (which admittedly is of limited interest). If you just want to use Acquia 1.2.4, then check out:</p><p><a href="http://github.com/rtanglao/acquia-drupal-6/"> my acquia drupal 6 repository</a>.</p>

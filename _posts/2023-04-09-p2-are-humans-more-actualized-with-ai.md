title: "Emily Bender: you are not a stochastic parrot / Judith Butler, are we more actualized with AI -> NY Magazine you are not a parrot"
---
* `“On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots” is not a write-up of original research. It’s a synthesis of LLM critiques that Bender and others have made: of the biases encoded in the models; the near impossibility of studying what’s in the training data, given the fact they can contain billions of words; the costs to the climate; the problems with building technology that freezes language in time and thus locks in the problems of the past.` [Please read the whole thing: You Are Not a Parrot And a chatbot is not a human. And a linguist named Emily M. Bender is very worried what will happen when we forget this.](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html)
* Judith Butler, UC Berkley: "Or that human potential — that’s the fascist idea — human potential is more fully actualized with AI than without it". [AGAIN :-), please read the whole thing](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html)

* January 9, 2020:  [Working with 4 University of Alberta Computer Science Students in the CANOSP program on a machine learning project to auto-tag Firefox desktop support questions based on a human trained dataset](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/01/19/p1-canosp-firefox-support-question-tagging-project-machine-learning-university-alberta/) <- in retrospect this seems like a primitive project now :-) Is this better with GPT-3 or 4?

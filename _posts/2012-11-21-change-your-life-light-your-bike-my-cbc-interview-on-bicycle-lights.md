These hub dynamos unlike the awkward bottle dynamos you grew up don't rub on the wheel and are very efficient and have a "stand light" feature so they stay on for a few minutes after you stop! All powered by your bicycling so no batteries required and quite powerful with the latest LED lights like the ones from Lumotec and E3.<br /> <br /> The best lights for hub dyamos are German:</p><p>This is what I have: <br /> <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/lighting/lumotec-hub.html">http://sheldonbrown.com/harris/lighting/lumotec-hub.html</a> (Lumotec IQ CYO front; and the matching rear light)<br /> I dream of someday owing the even brighter ones from e3<br /> <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://supernova-lights.com/en/products/e3pro2.html">http://supernova-lights.com/en/products/e3pro2.html</a></p><h2>But of course my setup has even more bicycle lights, in fact it's verging on overkill, but I am quite happy with the amount of light</h2><ul><li>In addition to the lights from the Gold Medal level, I also ride with lights on my spokes, so called persistence of vision lights. I ride with the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/minimonkey/mini-monkey-light-wheel-lights-for-bicycles">Mini Monkey Light </a>which displays 25 8 bit patterns including Space Invaders which I got from Kickstarter. But you can get them from good bike shops here in the city or directly from MonkeyLectric in Seattle</li><li>But wait there's more. I also ride with the 500 Lumen Front Light Urban 500 (the Urban 500 is no longer available but you can get the <a href="http://www.lightandmotion.com/bike/urban550.html">Urban 550 which</a> emits 550 lumens)</li></ul><h3>In the future I will have turn signals and perhaps more!</h3><ul><li>I know there's a British company that makes a turn signal bicycling jacket, but I can't find the link. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5913591/create-a-bicycling-jacket-with-turn-signals">Here's a DIY Turn Signal Bicycling jacket.</a></li><li>I have experimented with DIY Electroluminescent&nbsp; wire to <a href="http://bikingtoronto.com/blog/2011/09/how-to-tron-ify-your-bike/">"tron my bike"</a> but I'd rather purchase a more polished i.e. aesthetically pleasing EL solution (and I will :-) !)</li><li>And I'd love to have this <a href="http://ca.gizmodo.com/5943831/laser-bike-light-creates-your-own-tron+like-virtual-lane">laser powered portable virtual bike lane</a></li></ul>

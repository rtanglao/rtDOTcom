title: "The OM Systems OM-3 will be a very small 'h' hit simply because of its cool in camera real time while shooting (and post in camera) adjustment of photos and videos. but at $USD2000 it's too pricey for it to be a capital 'H' hit (the X100VI is $USD1600!). People already have a water resistant camera namely their iOS or Android phone and all the other features are already on phones soooo.... #ProbablyWrongPrediction"

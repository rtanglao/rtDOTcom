title: Deep Learning in 7 lines of code?!?
---

## Pontifications

* [Deep Learning in 7 Lines of code](https://chatbotslife.com/deep-learning-in-7-lines-of-code-7879a8ef8cfb)
* Impressive but it still seems to be 1950s and 60s technology with more RAM and CPUs, not sure there is "real" learning.
* I need to try something like this with my Vancouver flickr and instagram photo datasets!

* Data isn't  as useful if other folks can't use it.
* Therefore  [Jacob Kaplan- Moss's Pinboard -> SQLite](https://github.com/jacobian/pinboard-to-sqlite) -> [datasette -> glitch](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/04/23/p1-datasette-on-glitch-has-a-future-but-seems-harder-than-zeit-now/) sounds amazing to me because then I can query my bookmarks with SQL!

<p>I don't "illegally" download anything anymore but the RIAA and MPAA would make more money for their members if they chose to do the right thing and work with downloaders rather than suing them.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/2004/12/mark-pesce-on-bittorrent.html">Mark Pesce's Out of Control: The Sequel - Susan Mernit's Blog</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>Pointing up the single greatest weakness of BitTorrent take down the
tracker and the torrent dies - has only served to energize, inspire and
mobilize the resources of an entire global ecology of software
developers, network engineers and hackers-at-large who want nothing so
much, at this moment, as to make the MPAA pay for their insolence.
Imagine a parent reaching into a child's room and ripping a TV set out
of the wall while the child is watching it. That child would feel anger
and begin plotting his revenge. And that scene has been multiplied at
least hundred thousand times today, all around the world. It is quite
likely that, as I type these words, somewhere in the world a roomful of
college CS students, fueled by coke and pizza and righteous indignation,
are banging out some code which will fix the inherent weakness of
BitTorrent - removing the need for a single tracker. If they're smart
enough, they'll work out a system of dynamic trackers, which could
quickly pass control back and forth among a cloud of peers, so that no
one peer holds the hot potato long enough to be noticed. They'll take
the best of Gnutella and cross-breed it with the best of BitTorrent.
And that will be the MPAA's worst nightmare.</p><p>Hey, Hollywood! Can you feel the future slipping through your fingers?
Do you understand how badly you've scr*wed up? You took a perfectly
serviceable situation - a nice, centralized system for the distribution
of media, and, through your own greed and shortsightedness, are giving
birth to a system of digital distribution that you'll never, ever be
able to defeat. In your avarice and arrogance you ignored the obvious:
you should have cut a deal with SuprNova.org. In partnership you could
have found a way to manage the disruptive change that's already well
underway. Instead, you have repeated the mistakes made by the recording
industry, chapter and verse. And thus you have spelled your own doom.</p>

<p>It's said that the best sequels are just like the original, only bigger
and louder. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare yourselves for one h*ll of a
crash. This baby is now fully out of control.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

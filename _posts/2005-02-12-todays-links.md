<br><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">Don't agree with much else in this post, but this is true: real broadband to the home (i.e. 10Mbps symmetrical) will trigger a lot of economic growth through apps and services we can't even imagine in today's bandwidth starbed world of 1-3 Mbps up and 128-640K down - &quot;The coming tech revolution comes down primarily to bandwidth -- leveraging the dark fiber that was stuffed underground in huge quantities five years ago to support communication services that weren't economically feasible at that time but we were all so stoked we didn't care. &quot;</span>

<br><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">Excellent, looking forward to cool Flash apps on Series 60 Phones - &quot;Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Macromedia (Nasdaq: MACR) today announced a licensing agreement that will integrate Macromedia Flash technology into Series 60 Platform.

<br><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">Amen - &quot;But its safe to say that we saw a lot of parallels to the Blogging 1.0 businesses that were built almost ten years ago and we think that some of those dreams will get realized in a much more meaningful way in Blogging 2.0.&quot;</span>

<br><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">Sounds about right - &quot;Now, of course, you can argue that what they said should not have been a firable offense, and that companies need to recognize that employees now have much louder virtual megaphones to use in bitching about their employment situation, but people aren't getting &quot;fired for blogging.&quot;&quot;</span>

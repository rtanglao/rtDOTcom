# Pontifications

* `'With documentation, it's rare for terms like "easy" to be intentionally condescending. Often times, writers use them to show that something isn't as intimidating as it sounds. If this is the case, think about what the docs are trying to communicate and replace the condescending language with word choices that better represent the intention'` <- from Carolyn Stransky: [How to remove condescending language from documentation](https://dev.to/meeshkan/how-to-remove-condescending-language-from-documentation-4a5p)
* Seems like a similar but less difficult version of [de-ranting](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/11/07/p1-tyee-comments-no-insults-de-ranting/). But I could be wrong about the level of difficulty. 
* There are lessons here for asking support questions on the internet; most obviously that users being condescending towards support folks and to software designers and developers not only isn't necessary but can be unhelpful and damaging.

<p>This should be fun. Maybe I'll sign up to do a <a href="http://northernvoice.ca/schedule/lightning-tool-talks/participation">flickr</a> lightning tool talk. Interested? Fill in the <a href="http://northernvoice.ca/schedule/lightning-tool-talks/participation">Northern Voice Lightning Tool Talk Participation Form</a>.</p><p>From <a href="http://northernvoice.ca/node/116">We're looking for a few good bloggers to get excited about their tools</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>The Lightning Tool Talks section has been suspiciously empty. Well, now is the time to fill it up!
</p>
<p>We're looking to have conference attendees participate by demonstrating their favourite weblog-related tool -- whether it's a cool photo sharing app, a great blog platform, or your favourite blog-related online tool.
</p>
<p>Interested? Fill out the participation form and let us know what you want to demo.
</p>
<p>The talks will be fast and furious, with time limits strictly enforced. Show off your favourite tricks and techniques, show your passion for the tool, or just show off! Bonus points for style, clothing and/or makeup, and "lightning-like" energy.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

Sorry for implying that he isn't in <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/03/22/i_still_believe_that_reading_and_writing_everyday_will_make_you_a_better_writer_unlike_mark_pilgrim">my previous post</a> as <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?__mode=red&#38;id=14">Tomas</a> pointed out!

In fact, due to Mark's writing, I've learned tons of stuff about <a href="http://diveintopython.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">accessibility</a>.

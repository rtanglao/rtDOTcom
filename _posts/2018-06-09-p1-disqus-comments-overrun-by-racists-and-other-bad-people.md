## Pontifications
* According to BuzzFeed's [How The Alt-Right Manipulates The Internetâ€™s Biggest Commenting Platform](https://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/how-the-alt-right-manipulates-disqus-comment-threads?utm_term=.km5o9290DA#.bsLxNnN4Mg),   Disqus is over-run by racists and other bad folks, when will this happen to github issues?
	* Hopefully never?	
	* Why does this happen to every free commenting service and blog service sad face?!?

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Feb 12, 2023 09:3  [The Four Horsemen of the Tech Recession – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2023/the-four-horsemen-of-the-tech-recession/) <-- "COVID 1.0" is over i agree but will the next thing i.e. 2.0 be worse the 1.0. I think t"Covid 2.0" is worse. More people are dying which is not a good thing!!!!! Masks! Don't work sick (if you have sick leave!!!) and go out sick! --> QUOTE: `Now that may seem like a bit of an odd statement given that COVID is for all intents and purposes over in most of the world. To state the obvious, COVID obviously still exists (and will forever), but it isn’t the dominant factor in the economy. That’s good for the vast majority of businesses — and by extension the broader economy — which were decimated by COVID.`

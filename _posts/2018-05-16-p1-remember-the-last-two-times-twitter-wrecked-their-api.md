title: "Remember the last two times twitter wrecked their API? Neither do I :-)"

## Pontifications

* First they made it hard (or was it first and second and third and fourth times)
* [Then Twitter charged outrageous fees :-) for API access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/pricing/aaa-all) 
* (I expect the above link to break the next time Twitter borks their API, the flickr API is still the gold standard!)
* It's a private business they can do whatever they want. Better off blogging methinks but I'm krazy :-) 
* I also think the black helicopters should take over twitter :-) but again I'm krazy ! Nationalize it :-) UN-takeover please!

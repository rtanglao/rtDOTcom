We Don't Know Yet - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-06/are-autonomous-vehicles-safer-than-human-drivers-we-don-t-know-yet) <-- **QUOTE**: `For proof, just look outside the US, where plenty of countries have managed to bring traffic fatalities down dramatically. Most recently, the Nordic cities of Helsinki and Oslo have gone an entire year without any cyclist or pedestrian deaths at all. How did they accomplish this feat? Local leaders credited a range of infrastructural and policy changes, from slower speed limits and wider sidewalks to higher car fees and stiffer enforcement.`

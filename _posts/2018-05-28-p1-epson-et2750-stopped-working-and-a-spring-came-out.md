## Pontifications

* [Epson 'Ecotank' ET-2750](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/25/p1-epson-et2750-ecotank-does-save-ink/) stopped printing, jams every time and a spring fell out! oops! it apparently has a 1 year warranty. I'll see if I can get it fixed under warranty.
* Up until it now when it jams every time it's been reliable!

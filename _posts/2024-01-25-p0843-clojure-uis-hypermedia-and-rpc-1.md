Part 1 - Thomas Cothran, Software Developer](https://thomascothran.tech/2023/11/clojure-uis-hypermedia-and-rpc-1/) <-- Can't wait for the rest of the series --> **QUOTE**: `In the rest of this series we will debunk some myths: ... * Following a REST or Hypermedia approach is incompatible with rich client interactivity ... * Hypermedia == Plain HTML ... * React+ is required for things like infinite scroll, inline edits, and offline functionality ... And we will discuss an alternative path, extending the hypermedia approach to achieve the same (or better) functionality with vastly less complexity.`

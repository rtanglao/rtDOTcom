<a href="http://blogtalk.net/oswaldrngp.html">Brigitte</a> presented about giving blogs to Austrians trainees using a dual interface: blog posts on the left, filtering and context interface on the right A mixed success: some of the clients used it ; most of their coaches didn't.

Why? Because it was too hard to use (and this wasn't stated and is just my guess, people didn't want to share.) We still have a ways to go as toolsmiths to make our blogging tools easier to use in my opinion.

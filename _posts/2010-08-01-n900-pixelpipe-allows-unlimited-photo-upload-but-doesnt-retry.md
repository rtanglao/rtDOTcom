The N900 version of Pixel Pipe *does* (yay! my apologies to the PixelPipe folks!) &nbsp;allow sharing of unlimited number of photo as follows:</p><ol><li>In the Photos app, touch the top (where it typically says "All Images")</li><li>Tap "Share Images"</li><li>Select as many images as you want to upload</li><li>Tap "Share"</li><li>Tap "Share via service"</li><li>Under Account, select your PixelPipe service</li><li>Tap "Share"</li></ol><p>It works great except when you lose connectivity. Then PixelPipe due to no fault of their own but due to Nokia's brittle sharing infrastructure doesn't retry when you re-gain connectivity. This retry "seamlessly when you re-gain connectivity" is what ShoZu does so well. It's not a big deal if you only load 1 or 2 photos. It is a big deal when you upload dozens ; then you have to figure out which photos were uploaded and then go through the above 7 step process for the remainder of the photos.</p>

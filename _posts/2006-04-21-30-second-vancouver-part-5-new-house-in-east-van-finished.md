<p>[Cross posted automagically from <a href="http://blip.tv/">blip.tv</a> to test out the relatively new blip.tv cross posting to Drupal feature! Have I mentioned that blip.tv rocks? It does, they don&#39;t get the press of YouTube but they have many more features (like post via email, could we please have a video upload API that ShoZu can hook into) and are the service behind <a href="http://www.geekentertainment.tv/">Geek Entertainment Televison</a> and many other cool video blogs. Back to normal tech blogging, nothing to see here!]</p> <div id="blip_movie_content_29574">&nbsp;</div><div id="blip_movie_content_29574"><a href="/rt/javascript:void(0);" onclick="play_blip_movie_29574();"><img src="http://blip.tv/uploadedFiles/Roland-VanVideoVerite113703-786.jpg" border="0" alt="" title="Play the movie" /></a><br /><a href="/rt/javascript:void(0);" onclick="play_blip_movie_29574();"></a></div><div id="blip_movie_content_29574"><a href="/rt/javascript:void(0);" onclick="play_blip_movie_29574();">Click to Play</a></div><br /><br />                                                                    <div class="blip_description">The <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/special-reports/east-van-new-house">New House in East Van</a> is finished and it&#39;s great but incredibly over-priced at my guessestimate of $CAN 500K for each of the 2 units.Unfortunately for those hoping for a Vancouver real estate bubble collapse, I don&#39;t see it happening. It may happen after the <a href="http://2010.dailyvancouver.com/">2010 Winter Olympics</a> but overall by world standards, property in Vancouver bubble or not is still undervalued. But remember this advice is worth what you paid for it, i.e. $0 :-) !<br /></div><div class="formats_available" style="margin-top: 15px"><strong>Formats available</strong>:	<a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Roland-VanVideoVerite113703.mp4">MPEG4 Video (.mp4)</a><br /><br /></div>

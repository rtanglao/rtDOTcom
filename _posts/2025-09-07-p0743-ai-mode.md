## QUOTE

* Read the whole thing: [Simon Willison:: Google's AI mode is good, actually](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/7/ai-mode/)

>When I wrote about how good ChatGPT with GPT-5 is at search yesterday I nearly added a note about how comparatively disappointing Google's efforts around this are.

>I'm glad I left that out, because it turns out Google's new "AI mode" is genuinely really good! It feels very similar to GPT-5 search but returns results much faster.

Geoffrey Litt, Peter van Hardenberg, Orion Henry:: Ink and Switch:: October 2020:: Project Cambria: Translate your data with lenses](https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/) <--  See also Anuj's post from September 2025:: [The Lexicon Interop Problem Competing AT platforms are using different lexicons. Should we be worried?](https://augment.leaflet.pub/3lxxnzrh6pc24) and Noel De Martin's 2021 post:: [Interoperable Serendipity](https://noeldemartin.com/blog/interoperable-serendipity) <-- **QUOTE**: `We propose a principled replacement for these messy solutions: an isolated software layer that translates data between schemas on demand. This layer allows developers to maintain strong compatibility with many schema versions without complicating the main codebase. Translation logic is defined by composing bidirectional lenses, a kind of data transformation that can run both forward and backward.`

title: August 2015 Apple Watch Thoughts
---

1. I've stopped using the camera remote control because it's a gimmick!
2. Siri to set alarms and timers is super helpful and useful all the time.
3. Getting text messages on the watch means I no longer miss text messages.
4. It's surprising how often you check the time!
5. I still don't understand the digital crown versus the button difference!
5. It's surprising how many little bugs there are! I don't recall the iPhone 2G having this many small fit and finish bugs but I bet I am mis-remembering!
5. Having said that while I was on vacation I left my Apple watch at  home and didn't miss it! 
6. I think it will be useful on vacation when apps appear.

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jun 18, 2025 14:32 [ME:: yay a more intuitive language than jq (which is fab but hard to learn) for filtering JSON ; André Arko:: fx, a language for working with JSON](https://andre.arko.net/2025/06/13/2025-06-13-fx/) <-- **QUOTE**: `Good news, you don’t have to learn a new language to filter JSON anymore, thanks to fx. With a docs site at the excellent domain fx.wtf, and the ability to filter interactively or by providing Javascript as arguments, fx is the program I have always wished that jq was.` <-- via [Julia Evans on Mastodon](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/114704626786265729)

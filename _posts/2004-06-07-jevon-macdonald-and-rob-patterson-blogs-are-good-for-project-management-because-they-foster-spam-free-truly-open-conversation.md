<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Conversations are the key
When we have a conference to plan, a system to change, or a topic to
research, we need to have conversations around what we want to
accomplish. To do this,
we need a project management space that is focused on these
conversations.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

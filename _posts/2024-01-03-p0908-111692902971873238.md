They replied and said actually, no, there are no settings for that. ... But first, their AI Support Bot took a crack at an answer — and absolutely, confidently hallucinated two settings that don’t actually exist. I thought I was losing my mind because they just weren’t there. ... That feels worse than just not replying at all, right?` -->  Will we laugh about these bad support bots as being so "primitive" in 2030?

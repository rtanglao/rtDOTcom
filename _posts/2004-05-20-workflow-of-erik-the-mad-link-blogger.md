<p>Awesome! Must revisit <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">Newzcrawler</a>! From <a href="http://www.thauvin.net/blog/news.jsp?date=2004-05-19">Erik's Weblog : How do I do it?</a>:</p><p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>A few days ago, the folks on #mobitopia were wondering how I manage my Linkblog, etc. They thought it would be something interesting to blog about. I've briefly explained the process before, but I'll go in more details this time around. Here goes nothing. How many feeds do you read? I monitor around 1600 feeds on a daily basis. How long does it take to read them all? First, I don't actually read everything. I usually scan the subject/topic first and weed out the stuff I'm definitely not interested with. Second, I rarely read everything at once, but when I do, it takes a little over an hour. I usually spend 30 minutes or so here and there throughout the day. Which news/feeds reader do you use, and why? NewzCrawler. Everything else I've tried (and I've tried them all) chokes on the sheer volume, or lacks some major functionality I really need. When I find something of interest I post it using the Blog This! editor:</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

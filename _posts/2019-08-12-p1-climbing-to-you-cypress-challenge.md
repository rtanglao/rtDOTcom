* I was inspired by yesterday's Cypress Challenge ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/2610662823), [2019 official chip time 1:00:15](https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2019/cypress/view/173) which was three minutes faster than [2018](https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2018/cypress/view/56); yay fantastic coaching from Brite Coaching and Lotus training!) to write a poem entitled [Climbing to You](https://roland.micro.blog/2019/08/12/climbing-to-you.html):

## Climbing to you

<pre>
Climbing to you Mom
Just around the corner
At the top of the next hill
I can see your smile and hear your laugh about your world travels
Climbing to you Goong Goong
Just around the corner
At the top of the next hill
I can see your smile and hear your laugh as we eat together
Climbing to you

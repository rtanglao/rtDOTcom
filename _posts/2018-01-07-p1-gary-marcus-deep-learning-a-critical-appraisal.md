## Pontifications

* [Gary Marcus: deep learning a critical appraisal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631) ([PDF of paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00631)) via [Gary's tweet](https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/948364570120335363), some juicy headings from the paper:
    * Is deep learning approaching a wall?
    * Deep learning thus far is shallow and has limited capacity for transfer
    * Deep learning thus far has no natural way to deal with hierarchical structure 
    * Deep learning thus far cannot inherently distinguish causation from correlation 
    * Deep learning presumes a largely stable world, in ways that may be problematic 
    *  Deep learning thus far works well as an approximation, but its answers often cannot be fully trusted 
    *  What would be better?

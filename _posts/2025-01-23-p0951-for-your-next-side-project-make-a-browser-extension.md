>Software should be a malleable medium, where anyone can edit their tools to better fit their personal needs. The laws of physics aren’t relevant here; all we need is to find ways to architect systems in such a way that they can be tweaked at runtime, and give everyone the tools to do so.

>Beyond the pragmatic efficiency benefits of building a browser extension, I would argue that it’s simply more fun to engage with the digital world in a read-write way, to see a problem and actually consider it fixable by tweaking from the outside.

>So, if you’re a programmer: the next time you come across an annoying problem on a web app frontend, maybe consider writing a browser extension to make it better, and then share it so that other people can benefit too.`

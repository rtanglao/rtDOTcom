Looking forward to video support (i&#39;d settle for 3GPP but love if it supported the N93&#39;s glorious 640x480 video).  </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br />Suggestions: </p><ul> <li>Don&#39;t call it kyte.tv if it doesn&#39;t do live video!!!! I am sure that is coming.</li> <li>Fix the chat to allow cut and paste</li> <li>Fix those URLs please: http://www.kyte.tv/channels/browse.html;</li><li>jsessionid=na3urj9uqokh.as02?first=0&amp;mode=LATEST#uri,channels/1114 belongs to 1999 no disrespect intended! </li>  </ul>

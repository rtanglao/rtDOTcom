This is PART-4 of The Product Manager’s guide to the Blockchain series! If you somehow landed on my publication for the first time, Welcome! I recommend you start from part 1, and then read part 2 and part3 before reading this post. However If you are the explorer type, read on!<br /><br/>

In Part 3 of this series, we looked at the mechanics of Ethereum and also talked about the concept of Ethereum Accounts, Smart Contracts and Gas — the fuel that helps all these pieces to work together. Its been a lot of reading so far, but while you can read all the blockchain content available on the internet, nothing helps understand blockchains better than building one yourself. So that’s what I did. You can simply follow this post and build a little prototype to see how everything we’ve talked about so far comes together.<br /><br/>

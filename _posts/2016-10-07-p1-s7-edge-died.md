title: My Samsung S7 Edge died
---
## Pontifications

* Not sure what happened. Was it water damage? But it's supposed to be water resistant!
* So I am back on the S6 Edge. Not water resistant. But really not that much different from the S7 Edge.
* But it appears (other than the camera app) to be faster because I have disabled all the Samsung bloatware.
* The camera app is slower to start and the camera is not as good (slower to focus, not as good in low light). Subtle but noticeable if you take as many photos as I do.

title: RethinkDB seems to be much better supported on Raspberry PI than Mongo
---

At least [the current version of RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/docs/install/raspbian/) seems to work unlike MongoDB. [Mongo’s current version (3.x) doesn’t compile officially on RaspberryPI or ARM.](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-1811)

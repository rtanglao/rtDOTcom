title: "Periodic reminder: Computer software is full of bugs and hard to create and modify"

## Pontifications

Just in case anybody forgot :-) :

* Coding a command line script that 1 person uses, usually the person writing it, is easy.
* Coding a mass market app means lots of bugs and it is hard to create and modify apps.
* Our greatest failure is our failure to communicate the above two statements.
* Hopefully this will change in the future and we'll have [secure, true software components](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/11/17/p1-everything-built-on-insecure-non-verified-layers-will-break-at-some-point-you-will-refactor-modify-those-layers-in-a-non-backwards-compatible-way/) that make software development for the masses pleasant and easy.

Great idea!

From <a href="http://www.wirelessmoment.com/2004/05/simon_woodside_.html">Reiter's Camera Phone Report: Simon Woodside releases semacode URL software for Symbian camera phones</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Computer programmer Simon Woodside has released version 1.0 of his semacode software for Symbian/Series 60 camera phones that, in essence, incorporates a URL within a barcode.

You snap a photo of the semacode graphic (left), the URL is displayed and you can click on it to access a Web page without having to laboriously enter the URL on a keypad. Simon has a Weblog that explains in detail the use and creation of semacodes.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

* `Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Devices and Printers > PCTV 800E > Properties > Drivers` and install the  latest driver which is from 2010.
* [Install Media Portal 2](https://www.team-mediaportal.com/mediaportal-download) and then done!
* Not sure how to do this on Mac but I bet there is an equivalent!

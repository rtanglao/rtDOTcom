title: "logseq for personal knowledge management looks promising for personal knowledge management and more"
---
* Tried [logseq](https://logseq.com/) for personal knowledge management and after a 30 minute quick dive, it looks promising.
* Looks like it might take its place in my  toolset alongside checkvist which I've been using since 2018.
* Previously: 
  * 2018: [Checkvist seems like a great omnioutliner on the web cross platform replacment  except for html export which doesn't implement expand and collapse  unlike omnioutliner](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/25/p1-checkvist-webapp-for-outlining-good-so-far/)     
  * 2005:  [I also used the awesome Instant Outliner (in 2002)](http://rolandtanglao.com/2005/06/13/i-also-used-the-awesome-instant-outliner/)

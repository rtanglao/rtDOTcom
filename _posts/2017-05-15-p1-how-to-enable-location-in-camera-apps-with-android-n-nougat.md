title: How To Enable geolocation with camera apps in Android N aka Nougat

## Pontifications

* For some strange reason (bug? "roland" aka user error :-) ?!?), all the Android N for Nougat Apps had their geolocation permission set to off and I had to manually set the geolocation permission on, here's how I did it for Lenka, BlackCamPro, etc on the Google Pixel XL:
* ```Settings```-> ```Apps``` -> select your app e.g. ```BlackCam Pro``` -> ```Permissions```  -> toggle ```Location``` to the right i.e. ```ON```
* Screenshot:

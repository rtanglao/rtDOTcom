## Pontifications

* By EVs I mean ALL electric vehicles (including buses, trams, subways, trains, cars, trucks, everything!). I don't count hybrids like the Prius (because it has an ICE) but I do count things like the BMWs with the "assist" engine.
* If anything this is conservative and will happen sooner. It took smartphones 3 years, why should it take more than 19 years for electric cars; we already have all of the pieces just like smartphones.

<p>It seems like only yesterday that I first started using Writely. In fact it was back in <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/10/02/writely_rocks_as_long_as_you_dont_use_nested_lists">early October 2005, five months ago</a>. Since then it's become my default cross platform way to create rich documents collaboratively despite its bugs like the fact that it can't pass the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/10/02/writely_rocks_as_long_as_you_dont_use_nested_lists">"Roland and Troy nested list test"</a> (but then no web writing app does!). Congrats to the Writely folks.</p>

<p>To the fine folks at Google a few humble pleas: Please don't pull a Blogger. Keep adding features such as fixing the aforementioned nested list bug. Keep Writely competitive unlike Blogger.  And finally consider picking up <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/03/07/dabble-db-wins-id-pay-for-that-award-at-under-the-radar">Dabble DB</a> as your spreadsheet web app.</p>

<p>Yes, we've been acquired by Google, and we're really excited about this for many, many reasons. But I can hear you saying, "I don't care why YOU'RE excited - I want to know how this change will impact ME!"</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

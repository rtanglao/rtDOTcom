* Cross-country skiing is such a happy place for me (and our entire family; so lucky to have found something we all love to do and to do together!
* So is taking photos (not editing them except for fast edits in RNI films )
* [Bicycling](https://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/changeyourliferideabike) of course!
* And finally walking

There are many alternatives and they're all fine Kottke:: “S🇺bstack Is At It Again”](https://kottke.org/24/12/substack-is-at-it-again) <- **QUOTE**: `Since I left S🇺bstack for beehiiv in January, I went from making a little bit of money to actually making a living as an independent journalist with my own publication. I didn’t need S🇺bstack’s Tw🇮tter-esque Notes feature or its recommendation network to grow; I used social networks — mostly Bluesky — to successfully promote my work. That personal engagement created, I believe, deeper relationships with my readers than passive subscriptions via an algorithm. Most importantly, I’ve remained committed to producing work that I’m proud of, and publishing it via a platform that doesn’t force me to compromise my values.` <-- [Read Ryanb Broderick's bluesky thread](https://bsky.app/profile/ryanhatesthis.bsky.social/post/3ldjeowoaas2b)

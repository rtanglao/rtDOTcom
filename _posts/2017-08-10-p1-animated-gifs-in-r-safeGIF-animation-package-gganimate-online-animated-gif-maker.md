## Pontifications

* tl;dr saveGIF from the [animation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/animation.pdf) package, the [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) package for ```ggplot2``` plots and [online-animated-gif-maker](https://ezgif.com/maker)

* Cool [animated GIF tutorial in R: Code for my educational gifs by Rafael Irizarry](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/08/08/code-for-my-educational-gifs/)

<blockquote>
"All these gifs are paginated R plots. You will see in the code that I used different approaches to converting individual plots to animated gifs. The first (not recommended) was to save files then do a system call to the ImageMagick convert tool. Through a simplystats comment, from Yihui Xie, I learned about the saveGIF function from the animation package, which is what I now use when the plots are made in R base. When using ggplot I use David Robinsonâ€™s gganimate package. Finally, if I want to add special effects, like phasing, I use the online Animated GIF maker."

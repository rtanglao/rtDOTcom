[I know my blog is NOT usually about politics, but <a href="http://www.paulhillsdon.com/blog/">Paul</a> is worth a brief digression!]
</p>
<p>
If I lived in Surrey, I'd be <a href="http://www.paulin08.com/">voting for Paul</a> today on the basis of his transport policy alone! Not only that my friend Paul is an articulate, passionate man who knows his stuff and I've been lucky enough to meet him at <a href="http://justagwailo.com/2007/12/18/vancouver-transit-camp-recap">TransitCamp</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/TransportHeroCamp">Transport Hero Camp</a> and many other transit related events in the city.

<blockquote>
	<p>
	One thing that Paul is passionate about is transit and he’s outlined an ambitious yet extremely responsible and practical proposal with his Transit for Tomorrow plan.
	</p>
	<p>
	“The detailed plan is quite simple: shift $1.1 billion provincial dollars from 6 km of SkyTrain in Surrey to funding a 43.4 km light rail network across Surrey and Langley.”
	</p>
	<p>
	In fact, transportation is one of the main reasons Paul has even considered a career in politics. “It was a matter of timing,” he noted “I decided to run and bring this to everyone’s attention.” However he’s also branching out and you’ll find his name in two places on your ballot this Saturday.

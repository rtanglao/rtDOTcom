## Pontifications

* Following up on: [HTML tags &lt;details> and &lt;summmary> can be used for expand/collapse with disclosure triangles for 'collapsible HTML'](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/26/p1-collapsing-and-expanding-disclosure-triangles-using-details-summary-html-tags/):
  * [checkvist has a nice open api](https://checkvist.com/auth/api) that can probably be used to convert the outlines faster and better than using converting to collapsible html from checkvist's html or markdown output

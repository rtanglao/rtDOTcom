* In case you were wondering :-)
* Colonialism has been great at marketing terrible food influenced by the USA (although Filipino fried chicken is delicious of course) and mostly good food influenced by Spain and Mexico (kaldereta, tamales, menudo, the list goes on and on. Not to mention the Philippines hidden sophisticated bread culture which has been overshadowed by overly sweet ensaymada (haha thanks USA influenced sweet obsession :-) )

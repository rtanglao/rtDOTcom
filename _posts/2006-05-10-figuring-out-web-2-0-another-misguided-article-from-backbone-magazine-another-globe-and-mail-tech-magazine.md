  Globe and Mail tech magazine

<p> Instead of regurgitating material from big companies like Yahoo who are doing &quot;Web 2.0 by acquisition&quot;, why not profile Canadian Web 2.0 startups like <a href="http://eqo.com/">eqo</a>, <a href="http://sxip.com/">sxip</a> and <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a> (at this rate the Globe and Mail will write about them in late 2007!) where the true innovation is happening? And also why do none of these Globe and Mail magazines ever talk about open source? Without open source there would be no flickr, in fact there would be almost no Web 2.0 companies.  Finally, it&#39;s not right  to preach at organizations that they &quot;better wrap their heads around Web 2.0 or they will find themselves stuck in a 1999 frame of mind&quot; when<a href="/rt/archives/2006/05/02/paul-limas-confessions-of-a-search-engine-optimizer-is-still-wrong-fact-checking-the-globe-and-mails-tq-part"> the same author advocated an 1999 style SEO strategy in the Globe&#39;s TQ just a couple of weeks of ago</a>. The &quot;authority&quot;  of the Globe and Mail is seriously undermined by flawed articles like this one. </p><p> FROM <a href="http://www.backbonemag.com/php_site/home.php?m_column_id=php_news/wmview.php?ArtID=1811">Backbone Magazine business technology news consumer technologies e-marketing news online.</a>: </p><p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p><blockquote> In short, Web 2.0 may be a coined phrase, but it is also a way of using online tools in a creative and collaborative manner. Software and hardware developers, researchers and scientists, businesses -- especially those with an online customer base -- not-for-profit groups, and even political organizations had better wrap their heads around Web 2.0, or they will find themselves stuck in a 1999 frame of mind.  </blockquote><p> <strong>END QUOTE</strong> </p>

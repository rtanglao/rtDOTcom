## Pontifications

* I'm thankful to family friends and computers without whom I'd have nothing!
* Be nice online and in so-called real life.
* This piece: [A letter of hope from Henry Rollins](https://calvinscanadiancaveofcool.blogspot.com/2018/06/a-letter-of-hope-from-henry-rollins.html?m=1)  seems apt (shared by [Michael Tippett](https://tippett.org/)  on the occasion of [Phillip Djwa](http://www.agentic.ca/studio/phillip-djwa)'s 50th), thanks Mike, happy 50th Philipp!

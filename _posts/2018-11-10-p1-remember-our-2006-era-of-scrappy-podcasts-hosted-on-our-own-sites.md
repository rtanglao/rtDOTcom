## Pontifications

* Remember 2006 when we used our own websites for own media like Dave's podcast: 
[Coffee talk with Gold Medalist Ross Rebagliati – Olympic Outsider #3 (enhanced)](https://daveostory.com/audio-pods-songs/olympic-outsider/coffee-talk-with-gold-medalist-ross-rebagliati-olympic-outsider-3-enhanced/)
* Neither do I :-)
* Bonus fun: [A Good Morning to Mike and Dave 14 second podcast](http://roland.micro.blog/2018/11/10/good-morning-dave.html) who inspired me to write this post. ([Mike's site](https://tippett.org/), [Dave's site](https://daveostory.com/); we're still here on the internet making our stuff, join us :-)!)

## Pontifications

* [Maha Bali: 'Where is the Humanity in the Computer Science Curriculum?'](https://dmlcentral.net/humanity-computer-science-curriculum/) <--- read it, it's excellent and thought provoking
* Me: 'Where is the Enlightenment in the Liberal Arts?'. Why did so many people who have Liberal Arts degrees vote for T* and H* and D*?
* We need people who are facts and science and arts based! All 3 not just 1! Not just selective bits of each !

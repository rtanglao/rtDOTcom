<p>Wow! Go BBC go! I want bookmarkable audio with tags everywhere!
</p><p>From <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/10/on_the_bbc_annotatable_audio_project.shtml">On the BBC Annotatable Audio project... (plasticbag.org)</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote><p>This post concerns an experimental internal-BBC-only project designed to allow users to collectively describe, segment and annotate audio in a Wikipedia-style fashion. It was developed by the BBC Radio & Music Interactive R&D team - for this project consisting of myself, Tristan Ferne, Chris Bowley, Helen Crowe, Paul Clifford and Bronwyn Van Der Merwe. Although the project is a BBC project, all the speculation and theorising around the edges is my own and does not necessarily represent the opinion of my department or the BBC in general.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

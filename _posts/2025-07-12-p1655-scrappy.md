>We ended up creating a research prototype that we call Scrappy — a tool for making scrappy apps for just you and your friends. First and foremost, we aim to contribute a vision of what home-made software could be like. We want to make this vision as concrete as we can, by sharing a working tool and examples of apps made in it. Scrappy, in its current state, is a prototype, not a robust tool, but we hope it paints the picture we carry in our heads — of software as something that can be creative, personal, expressive. Made by anyone, for themselves and their loved ones.

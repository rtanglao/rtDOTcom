## Pontifications

* Bought an Epson 'Ecotank' ET-2750 printer, it does save ink and is fast and works with wireless
	* So far so good, about 50 colour pages
	* It is fast and not too noisy
	* Decent scanner (at least up until now)
	* Mac Software doesn't install, instead I just print on OS X
	* [Preview on OS X is great for tweaking photos haven't found nanything aything like it on Windows still](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/10/p1-more-switching-to-windows-thoughts/)!

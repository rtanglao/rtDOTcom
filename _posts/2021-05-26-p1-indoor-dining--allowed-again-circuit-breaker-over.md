title: "I still won't be indoor dining until over 50% of the population has 2 vaccinations even though it's allowed as of May 25"

* [The circuit breaker lockdown that started March 30, 2021 in](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021PREM0023-000578) BC is over and indoor dining is allowed again as of May 25, 2021. When will that be? I'm hoping for October i.e. Canadian Thanksgiving or slightly earlier!
* I still won't be indoor dining until over 50% of the population has 2 vaccinations even though it's allowed now?
* Why? aerosols, lack of filtration and ventilation in 99% of the restaurants and variants #ymmv :-)
* Stay healthy!

title: "Dave Winer's UserLand's Instant Outliner from the 2000s coming back in 2021? (bonus Jon Udell blog post about Instant Outliner)"

* From the rolandtanglao.com archives: [April 1, 2002 from the wayback machine aka Internet Archive: O'Reilly Network: Jon Udell: Instant Outlining, Instant Gratification (Apr. 01, 2002)](http://web.archive.org/web/20020402073722/http://www.rolandtanglao.com/) <-- it only took 19 years but maybe [Instant Outlining is coming back](http://scripting.com/2021/06/11.html#a131743)?!?!? It was a good idea in the 2000s and it's a good idea in 2021! Thanks, Dave, UserLand folks and everybody else involved for the original idea!

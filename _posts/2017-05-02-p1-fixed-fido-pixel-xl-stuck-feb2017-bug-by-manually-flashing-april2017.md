title: Fixed Fido unlocked vanilla Pixel XL stuck at Feb 2017 ROM bug by manually flashing April 2017 ROM
---

## Pontifications
* I fixed the ["unlocked vanilla Pixel XL running Fido "corrupted" firmware :-) stuck at Feb 2017"](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/mQzpXYDmRxE) bug by manually flashing April 2017 using [Techno :-) LOL Bill's fab rescue OTA instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6x7k-VkpUJMlZ1aEliVnhMOHM/view)
* I hope I don't have to do this every month. It's painful but definitely doable. And not what Google advertises for the Pixel especially a Pixel that has vanilla Android and wasn't bought with a carrier ROM. Updates are supposed to occur monthly from Google unimpeded by carrier craziness!

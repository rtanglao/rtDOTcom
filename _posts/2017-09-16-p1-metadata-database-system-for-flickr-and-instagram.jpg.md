title: "Photo Metadata Database for flickr and instagram"

## Pontifications

* This is my long term goal: A "Photo Metadata Database for flickr and instagam"
* The database could be mongodb or redis ! Basically anything that stores json and has a decent query language.
* Poll the flickr and instagram API once an hour. Get the average colour and all the other meta data including lat/long.
* Use the meta data to make infographics and visualizations (which could be turned into t-shirts) once an hour.

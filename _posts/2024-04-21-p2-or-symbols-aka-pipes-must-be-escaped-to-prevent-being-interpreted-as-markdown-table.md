title: "Pipe characters aka 'or symbol' aka '|' must be escaped with a backslash to prevent being interpreted as a table in Markdown"
---

* In the previous post, I re-discovered :-) that pipe characters aka the "or symbol " aka `|` must be escaped with a backslash to prevent being interpreted as a Markdown table. [Example 308 of the github flavoured markdown spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-308) seems to document which characters must be escaped (e.g. in addition to the pipe character, exclamation mark, quotation marks, etc.):
  * \!\"\#\$\%\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\-\.\/\:\;\<\=\>\?\@\[\\\]\^\_\`\{\|\}\~

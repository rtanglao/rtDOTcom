I wrote this poem for the [2017 Ride To Conquer Cancer](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/08/19/p1-ride-to-conquer-cancer-fundraiser-softball-game-bbq/):

"Rolling to Redmond"

```
Rolling for you Mom
Rolling for you Dad
Rolling for you Goong Goong
Rolling for you Sandie
Rolling because you can't beat us Emperor of Maladies
I'm rolling with you Eva
I'm rolling with you Andy
I'm rolling with you yellow flag survivors
My heart is rolling
Rolling from Cloverdale
Rolling to Redmond
```

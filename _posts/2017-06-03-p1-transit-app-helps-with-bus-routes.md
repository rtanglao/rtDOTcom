title: Transit App is accurate with Vancouver bus routes, thanks!

## Pontifications
* Less than 12 times a year I take the bus here in Vancouver.
* Tonight was one of those nights.
* The [Transit iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/transit-real-time-app-for-bus-subway-metro/id498151501?mt=8) amazingly enough appears to have the right information, in an easy to use format and a beautiful interface. Kudos! Highly Recommended!

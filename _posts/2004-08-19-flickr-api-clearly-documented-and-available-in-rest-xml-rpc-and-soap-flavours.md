Wow! Now I want to write apps.  Other platforms like <a href="http://pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> should follow Flickr's lead: clearly document the APIs and be API religion agnostic by offering APIs for the 3 major cross platform religions: REST, XML-RPC, and SOAP.

From <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr Services</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>The Flickr API is now available for non-commercial use by outside developers.

For an example of an application built with this API, see Organizr (or here if you are already a Flickr member).</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

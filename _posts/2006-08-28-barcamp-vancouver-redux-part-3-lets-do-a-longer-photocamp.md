<p>
I'd love to do a 6-8 hour PhotoCamp (thinking out loud program: eat, photowalk, a few sessions, photowalk, a session or 2 and then go home?)! In the 1 hour <a href="http://barcamp.org/PhotoCamp">PhotoCamp</a> session at BarCamp, I learned a lot! <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/">Kris</a> you in? Anybody else in ? Love to have <a href="http://www.utata.org/articles//utatabites/13313.php">VanDigiCam</a> (and other Vancouver digital photography groups) co-organize this!

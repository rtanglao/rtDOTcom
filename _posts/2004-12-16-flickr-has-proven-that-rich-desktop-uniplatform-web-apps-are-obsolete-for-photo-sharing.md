<p>I can't use <a href="/rt/heypix.com">HeyPix</a> because you can ONLY upload photos if you have Windows which s*cks!  <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> has proved that NON cross platform photo sharing and organizing web apps like HeyPix are obsolete.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/12/15.html#a8896"<p>Flickr has new competition: HeyPix - Scobleizer: Microsoft Geek Blogger</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Flickr, don't look over your shoulder, but there are some new photo sharing services coming that are looking pretty darn interesting.</p>

<p>First one is HeyPix!
</p>
<p>Someone should write up a review of all the photosharing apps out there. Flickr is definitely the market leader, at least among the blogs I watch.
</p>
<p>James Park, founder of Windup Labs, the folks that just shipped HeyPix today, gave me a demo of HeyPix about a week ago and it had several advantages. The sharing app was easier to use and had more features.</p>

<p>I'll put up a Flickr and a HeyPix site and let you see the differences.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

<p>[Via email from <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>] Wow! There is a <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/yjevents/estespark.cfm">Yoga conference featuring Iyengar</a>  (the type of yoga Barb has been doing for almost 10 years!) in Colorado from September 26-October 2, 2005 and the Iyengar founder, BKS Iyengar will be there. Not only that. They have a <a href="http://blogs.yogajournal.com/?ctsrc=blurb2">blog</a>. Very cool. <a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/204">Web 2.0</a> for everybody! It's not just for geeks any more!</p>

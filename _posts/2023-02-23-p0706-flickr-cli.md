Upload and download photos, photo sets, directories via shell.](https://github.com/TheFox/flickr-cli) <-- Hasn't been updated for 5 years, wonder if it still works. Se also https://github.com/luk355/flickr-uploader which looks less versatile. And see also https://github.com/oPromessa/flickr-uploader/ which looks less versatile and again hasn't been updated in yonks :-)

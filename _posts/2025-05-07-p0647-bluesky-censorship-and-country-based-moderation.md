>For now, it seems that Blᜂesky PBC and the Tᜂrkish government both have reached a situation that is acceptable for both parties. The Tᜂrkish government has significantly restricted the visibility of accounts they deem unwanted. Sidestepping these restrictions remains an option, with new and easier ways to do so. But considering how powerful the default apps are and how few people use other apps, this seems likely to be an acceptable tradeoff. For Blᜂesky PBC it seems to be an acceptable outcome as well. Not complying with the government order would risk the app to be banned in the entire country. Using geographic moderation labelers gives compliance with the government order, while at the same time minimising the impact: the accounts in question are still visible outside of the country, and people within Tᜂrkey have fairly accessible ways of sidestepping the ban.

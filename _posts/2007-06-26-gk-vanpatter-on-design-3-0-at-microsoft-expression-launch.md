<p> Inspired by Jonathan of <a href="http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/">atmasphere</a>, I decided to try <a href="http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2007/05/18/testing-video-services">Viddler</a> for my video of <a href="http://www.nextd.org/05/index.html">GK VanPatter</a> of <a href="http://www.nextd.org/">NextD</a> at the Microsoft Expression Launch in Canvas in Gastown last Thursday. Cool features: you can tag and comment and video comment on  both the entire video and anywhere in the timeline. Question: Can you get RSS feeds of all that? </p><p> Like <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/microsoft-expression-launch-event-canvas-lounge-gk-vanpatter-and-silverlight">Boris</a>, I internally re-coiled at GK&#39;s mention of Design &quot;3.0&quot; and &quot;2.0&quot; but whatever you call it, the idea of solving the big problems of society and not just designing yet another product is an idea whose time has come. I gently challenged GK afterwards to contribute back to Canada (he&#39;s a Canadian based in New York) and he challenged us by asking does Bryght have a designer? I think that integrated multi-disciplinary teams helping solve big societal problems as well as designing products are the key challenges of the 21st century and open source is a large part of that. </p> <p> What about Silverlight and Expression, the actual focus of the event? Ho Hum. I used to love iView Media Pro (and still have 10,000 photos and videos in a an iView Media catalogue) but compared to Lightroom and Aperture (and yes I know they are apples and oranges since Expression Media, the successor to iView Media Pro since the Microsoft acquisition is a true digital asset management program and LR and Aperture only do photos) the interface in Expression Media seems old fashioned and much hasn&#39;t changed.  Until Macs and Linux are first class development and deployment platforms for Silverlight, I can&#39;t take the Expression tools seriously. As for Web and the other programs in the Expression Suites they are not my thing! Others like <a href="http://andnowyouknow.net/mac/microsoft-tries-it%e2%80%99s-hand-at-design-and-hiding-the-elephant-20070622/">Morten</a> have a better perspective. However it&#39;s something to watch and Microsoft and <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/Jun-21.html">others are working on full Mac and Linux suppor</a>t so wait and see. </p> <p> Herewith the 15 minute 15 second video (<a href="http://www.viddler.com/show_movie!orgFile.action?movieToken=14ea5b86">original 300 MB MPEG-4 video)</a> complete with my inline tags and comments for your viewing pleasure :-)  (also check out <a href="http://www.freyburg.com/archives/2007/06/microsoft_expre_1.html">Warren Frey&#39;s Expression launch video</a>)! </p>

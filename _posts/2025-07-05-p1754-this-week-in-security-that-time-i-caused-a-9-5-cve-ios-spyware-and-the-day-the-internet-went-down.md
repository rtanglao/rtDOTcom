>The attack chain that X-Force highlights is convoluted, with the SVG containing a link offering a PDF download. Clicking this actually downloads a ZIP containing a JS file, which when run, downloads and attempts to execute a JAR file. This may seem ridiculous, but it’s all intended to defeat a somewhat sophisticated corporate security system, so an inattentive user will click through all the files in order to get the day’s work done. And apparently this tactic works.

>We’ve talked a few times about vibe researching, but [Craig Young] is only tipping his toes in here. He used an LLM to find a published vulnerability, and then analyzed it himself. Turns out that the GIMP despeckle plugin doesn’t do bounds checking for very large images. Back again to an LLM, to get a Python script to generate such a file. It does indeed crash GIMP when trying to despeckle, confirming the vulnerability report, and demonstrating that there really are good ways to use LLMs while doing security research.

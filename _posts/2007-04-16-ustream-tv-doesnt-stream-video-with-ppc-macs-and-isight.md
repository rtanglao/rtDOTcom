title: ustream.tv doesn't stream video with PPC Macs and iSight?

<p> I can&#39;t get <a href="http://ustream.tv/">ustream.tv</a> to stream video with my Power PC Powerbook G4 and iSight. I know it works with MacBook Pros (because <a href="http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/">atmasphere</a> got it to work). Any clues or workarounds would be appreciated.  I have tried Firefox 2 and Safari. Email roland AT rolandtanglao.com or leave a comment. </p>

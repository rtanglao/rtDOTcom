title: Bret Victor-like programming environments-- Smalltalk, Lamdu, Eve, et al which ones should I try?

## Pontifications


* I agree with [Bret in his amazing Learnable Programming post from 2012](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) which I read in 2012 and continue to re-read and learn from every year since 2012!

* What environments are there like this other than the following and that are worth trying?
    * Smalltalk (the first and still not topped it seems to me)
    * [Eve](http://witheve.com/)
    * [Lamdu](http://www.lamdu.org/)
    * Others? (Clojure-like and Haskell-like languages seem to be what these things are built on but I have another list of languages I should dabble in and these two are on it together with Julia and I've already started tinkering with Haskell)

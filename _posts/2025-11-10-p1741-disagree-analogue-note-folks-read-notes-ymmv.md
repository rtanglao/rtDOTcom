And there's no links. Digital text wins. If your notes are digital and text only (markdown, html, none of that other stuff :-)  or text + PNG and JPEG it's simple (no crazy Obsidian or other note taking system needed) and will last forever. I want my Newton back. I guess I'll eventually buy an iPad mini with something like the  [paperlike](https://paperlike.com/) screen protector that enhances the writing experience with an Apple Pencil and a Remarkable. Stylus plus printing recognition works for me., Again #Ymmv :-)  an example of the analogue note taking propaganda er marketing :-)  is `reysu's video`: [the hybrid note-taking system I wish I learned earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq0XvGPSm9w\)  advocates both :-) digital and analogue no thanks!

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 19, 2022 11:31 [With "Immunity Debt," Democrats are Having their Ivermectin Moment](https://thegauntlet.substack.com/p/with-immunity-debt-democrats-are?fbclid=IwAR17SsQEjXMDOhXBWaQ7838tmnksoNbuz-BfbHTSqFGd1vHbJRhD06vf1vo) <-- tl;dr: Immunity debt is bogus and NOT a thing. --> QUOTE: `It’s time to take post-COVID immune deficiency seriously and in turn, to accept that a “new normal” would mean high-quality ventiliation everywhere, indefinitely working from home, and universal high-quality masking, for starters. This is not a disease we can live with- certainly not the way we are living with it. “Old normal” cosplay will never bring 2019 back, but it will kill and maim many more children before we are done with it. Like the Republicans before us, we deserve better than being told to get back to work and enjoy our twice-annual infections. Following in their footsteps by swallowing every evidence-free half-truth our government throws at us will leave us no better off than the MAGA crowd. `

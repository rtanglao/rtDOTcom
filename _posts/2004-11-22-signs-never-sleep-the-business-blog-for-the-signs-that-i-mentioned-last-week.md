Here's <a href="http://signsneversleep.blogspot.com/">the sign blog</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/11/18/building_21st_century_websites_with_weblogs_and_rss_with_darren_barefoot">I talked about last week</a>.  It's very cool and yet another example of how blogs = $!

<p>From <a href="http://signsneversleep.blogspot.com/">Signs Never Sleep</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>Lincoln Sign Company is a small, custom sign shop specializing in carved, sandblasted & dimensional signs, but we will happily do just about any job (big or small) that is sign related. The company has been in operation since 1972 and was started by Rick & Chris Weissbrod. J.D. & Vicki Iles recently took over the business this past May, and have been having fun ever since!

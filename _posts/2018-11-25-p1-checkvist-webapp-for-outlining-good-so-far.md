title: "Checkvist seems like a great omnioutliner on the web cross platform replacment except for html export which doesn't implement expand and collapse unlike omnioutliner"

## Pontifications
* As per: [Looking for recommendations: OmniOutliner for Windows or as a cross platform webapp? Checkvist seems close!](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/05/p1-omni-outliner-for-windows/) I've been trying out Checkvist for the last week i.e. [Week 3 of My Firefox 63 desktop SUMO forum report](https://checkvist.com/checklists/695874).
* So far so good except for html export which doesn't implement expand and collapse "disclosure triangles" unlike omnioutliner!
  * Hope lives on, maybe somebody can write or has written a markdown to disclosure triangle HTML script or some such :-)
  * or maybe I'll write the script (unlikely :-) !)
  * or maybe somebody has done one for markdown?!?

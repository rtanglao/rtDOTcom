## Pontifications

[information wants to be free + “Yes, but people want to get paid.” ! = military javascript industrial complex](http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/12/10/exploring-the-business-behind-digital-medias-invisibility-cloaks/)

Ultimately if we don't destroy ourselves and/or this planet, we'll move to a place where money is irrelevant ! Seriously! Until then, things like patreon and having ethics about ads (i.e. don't blindly call javascript ad networks, use something that won't serve your ads on embarrassing and racist and sexist ads like br*itbart.com) will go a long way !!!!

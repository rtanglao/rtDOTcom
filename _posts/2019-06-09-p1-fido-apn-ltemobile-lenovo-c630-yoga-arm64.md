* If you insert a SIM card, then from "Fido Stephen"'s [Fidoâ€™s APN & MMS Settings](https://forums.fido.ca/t5/General-Support/Fido-s-APN-amp-MMS-Settings/td-p/91614) all you need is to create an APN  called: <br />
    **LTEMOBILE.APN**                   
* That's it, that's all :-) MMS settings not required!

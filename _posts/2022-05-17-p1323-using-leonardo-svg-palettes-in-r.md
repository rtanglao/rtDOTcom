[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): May 17, 2022 13:23  [Using Leonardo SVG Palettes in R ¦ rud.is](https://rud.is/b/2022/05/17/using-leonardo-svg-palettes-in-r/) <-- QUOTE: `The (Adobe) app lets you download the palettes in many forms, as well as just copy the values from the site. Two of the formats are SVG: one for discrete mappings (so, a small, finite number of colors) and another for continuous mappings (so, a gradient). I’ll eventually add the following to my {swatches} package, but, for now, you can tuck these away into a snippet if you do end up working with Leonardo on-the-regular.`

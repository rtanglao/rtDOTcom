<a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/01/31/another-n70-cool-feature-hold-to-toggle-between-silent-and-general-profiles">Just like Nokia N series phones</a>, you can hold down the "#" key when on the home screen to toggle the ring from silent to normal and vice versa. Useful feature for when you are in a meeting or a place where a cellphone ring would be obnoxious. I still think it should be toggling between normal and pager and not silent but maybe that's just me!

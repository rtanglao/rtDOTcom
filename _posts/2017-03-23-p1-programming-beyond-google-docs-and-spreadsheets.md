title: Programming for normal people beyond Google Docs and Google Sheets?
---

## Pontifications

* 1/16 [Databases for "the normal non procedural programming" people in 2017 seem to be Excel and Google Docs (spreadsheets and Writely er I](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/844719474204913664)
* 2/16 mean whatever they are called now :-))
* 3/16 Anything better out there?
* 4/16 When it comes to correlating, chopping and slicing, visualizing, calculation, aggregation, etc, it seems we are stuck with what Excel
* 5/16 and Google Docs give us which isn't much.
* 6/16 Sure you can do easy charts!
* 7/16 Sure you can combine columns and rows.
* 8/16 But what if you want to do "real" programming aka something more complex encompassing both the richness of the web and the spreadsheet or
* 9/16 document you are in?
* 10/16 Normal folks can't. Geeks have 8 million solutions: R Studio, Julia, Jupiter notebooks etc etc
* 11/16 Something built on top of Google Spreadsheets with some sort of scripting language maybe? (the crazy Google Apps Script language that
* 12/16 Google uses is silly but I'm biased)
* 13/16 I have no idea but I think some fab creativity would be unleashed if there were a way to give more"procedural like programming" power
* 14/16 to the people.
* 15/16 I'm sure we've already invented this: e.g. Xerox Parc, Smalltalk, the mother of all demos, Brett Victor's stuff but does anybody
* 16/16 have an affordable solution on the web I can point normal people to try today instead of some prototype or research project?

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/3409381287/" title="Sports Tracker Screenshot0047 by roland, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/3409381287_e325ff59dc_o.jpg" alt="Sports Tracker Screenshot0047" width="320" height="240" /></a></p> <p>Here's my very rough draft <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157616316200470/">Nokia Sports Tracker Tutorial</a> for the recently released version 2.06. It still is too complicated and harder to use than Nokia viNe but appears to be regularly updated unlike viNe. And it still doesn't remember my Live Sharing Pref which I think is a bug and is annoying because I want my maps to be always shared ]!</p>

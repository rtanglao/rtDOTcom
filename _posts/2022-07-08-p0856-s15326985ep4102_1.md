[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jul 8, 2022 08:56  [Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work: An Analysis of the Failure of Constructivist, Discovery, Problem-Based, Experiential, and Inquiry-Based Teaching: Educational Psychologist: Vol 41, No 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15326985ep4102_1) <-- QUOTE:`Evidence for the superiority of guided instruction is explained in the context of our knowledge of human cognitive architecture, expertâ€“novice differences, and cognitive load. Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appealing, the point is made that these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that consistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process.` <-- applies to learning how to write software of course!

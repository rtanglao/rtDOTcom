## Pontifications

* Canon 5D "classic"+40mm "pancake" + eye-fi mobi SD card = 21st century camera fun! (using a CF to SD card adapter)
* Connectivity makes a huge difference. As always! Just shoot jpeg and upload automatically!
* Would be cool if we could add a digital back to vintage film cameras with an SD card slot for the eyefi (or something like the eye-fi)

### Sample Picture from the 5D

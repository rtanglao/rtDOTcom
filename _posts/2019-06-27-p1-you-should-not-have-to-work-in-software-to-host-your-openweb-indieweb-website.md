* I agree with [Susan Jones](https://resourceroomblog.wordpress.com/)'s comment on Ton's post: [An Obligation to Explain the IndieWeb](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/an-obligation-to-explain-the-indieweb/): "[Yes; it  does require lots of tech skills that are constantly changing so you have to be in the field basically to keep up.   A person w/ a day 
  job in education?  Not gonna happen ðŸ™‚   Worth following along, though](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2019/06/an-obligation-to-explain-the-indieweb/#comment-126959)"
* Not sure it's possible to follow along completely without a lot of work (worthwhile work if you have the time and the capacity mind you)
* Until then what do you suggest? I suggest simple static websites  on your own domains and lots of experiments with folks near you in real life if possible on open web services that allow you to back up your data like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) and finding a technical person on the web or in real life  who can continually explain it to you like [Ton](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/)!

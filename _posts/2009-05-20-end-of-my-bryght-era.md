title: End of my Bryght Era

<p>May 15, 2009 was my last day of work for Raincity Studios and with it of course my involvement with Bryght ended as well. It's been a great ride! Thanks to all the Bryght Gals, Guys, customers, investors, friends and of course the folks at Raincity Studios. I am certain that the "Bryght Children" will in their own way (in a small "Fairchild children" way, haha!)&nbsp; continue to make their mark&nbsp; (e.g. <a href="http://rilli.com/">Rilli</a>, <a href="http://bootuplabs.com/">Bootup Labs</a>, and I predict many many more). My next post will be about my new job but for now a few random thoughts and reflections (apologies to the great people I have omitted!):</p><ul><li>I'll never forget moving day into the first Bryght offices at 525 Seymour with the folks at EQO (also gone).</li><li>Bryght Light developed by Adrian and the rest of the Bryght team was and is a Drupal milestone. I can't to see what the fine folks at Lullabot and Acquia&nbsp; and WorkHabit and the other fine folks doing Drupal hosting come up with. Not to mention what happens with Development Seed, Adrian and&nbsp; the other folks developing Aegir. Aegir definitely ups the proverbial Drupal hosting 'ante'.</li><li>Speaking of WorkHabit, I will always be impressed by their VPS hosting partnership with Bryght. As far as I know Bryght VPS was the only Drupal-centric VPS hosting from a Canadian company, one of the few in the world and probably the first. Nobody did it better. Thanks to Richard, Gary of WorkHabit, incredible system engineers and sysadmins: Narayan Newton and Ben Holt. Learned some great lessons:i.e. always iterate, automate and listen to the market!</li></ul><p>Herewith some random Bryght photos to end it off in a visual style! Ciao Tschüß!</p><p><a title="Fri19Nov2004 Dinner with Dave Winer at Phnom Penh - Boris, Kris by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/1587432/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/2/1587432_1d6a06de91_s.jpg" alt="Fri19Nov2004 Dinner with Dave Winer at Phnom Penh - Boris, Kris" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Walking to New Town Bakery - N95-1 image - 035 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/1936160629/"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2066/1936160629_902ee92eae_s.jpg" alt="Walking to New Town Bakery - N95-1 image - 035" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Buying a Europe to North American adapter - 07/12/2006 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/316806613/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/102/316806613_72e71221a5_s.jpg" alt="Buying a Europe to North American adapter - 07/12/2006" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Bryght walk - Downtown to Strathcona 05June06 - 7 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/180207691/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/56/180207691_2f6049af4e_s.jpg" alt="Bryght walk - Downtown to Strathcona 05June06 - 7" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Loyalty Fidelity Broccoli digitally cross processed by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/102334798/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/21/102334798_de4f57fb4a_s.jpg" alt="Loyalty Fidelity Broccoli digitally cross processed" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Drupal - OSCON 2005 T shirt sneak peek by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/30549220/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/30549220_3127a943d7_s.jpg" alt="Drupal - OSCON 2005 T shirt sneak peek" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Pre Gnomedex - 22June2005 - 12 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/21131476/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/16/21131476_44b6fcc16a_s.jpg" alt="Pre Gnomedex - 22June2005 - 12" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="New Raincity Studios Offices - Album Cover Pose II by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/66022950/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/30/66022950_5ce21c2be5_s.jpg" alt="New Raincity Studios Offices - Album Cover Pose II" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Phones for Fearless-20081223-129 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/3132516260/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3132/3132516260_365e649108_s.jpg" alt="Phones for Fearless-20081223-129" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Adrian arrives in Vancouver - 2 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/29402201/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/29402201_18aa7d8fe9_s.jpg" alt="Adrian arrives in Vancouver - 2" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Walkah plays with N91 - 17112006096 by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/299626512/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/117/299626512_a04985d867_s.jpg" alt="Walkah plays with N91 - 17112006096" width="75" height="75" /></a><a title="Puregin aka Djun at OSCMS by roland, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/96817770/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/38/96817770_8e1226f37c_s.jpg" alt="Puregin aka Djun at OSCMS" width="75" height="75" /></a></p>

[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 8, 2023 09:18 [Why millennials are dreading becoming mothers - Vox](https://www.vox.com/features/23979357/millennials-motherhood-dread-parenting-birthrate-women-policy) <-- We do have an all-encompassing climate crisis!!!!!! --> **QUOTE**: `We should have the courage to reject the all-encompassing crisis frame — which frankly isn’t working, anyway. We can’t expect to fully eliminate dread or even regret over having children. Rather, this is a gentle reminder that people can thrive doing the hard stuff, and we can build each other up without fear that we’ll sabotage prospects for bolder change. That’s a world that brings me hope. That’s a world I don’t dread. `

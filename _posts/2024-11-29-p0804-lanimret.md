[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 29, 2024 08:04 [Greg Wilson:: gvwilson/lanimret: Record ASCII terminal session with audio and then play back](https://github.com/gvwilson/lanimret) <-- super cool --> **QUOTE** from [Greg's toot](https://mastodon.social/@gvwilson/113567062296477960): `I know there are lots of tools out there to record and play back a terminal window session, but I can't find the one I bookmarked years ago that records both the terminal session and a voiceover, then replays them in sync. I've recreated the core of it in github.com/gvwilson/lanimret, but if anyone knows where the original inspiration lives these days, I'd be grateful for a pointer. (Motivation is to record/play back live coding sessions as searchable text rather than video.) thx` <-- [followup from Daniel Katz](https://fosstodon.org/@danielskatz/113567066272551465): **QUOTE**: `On a mac, you can just use command-shift 5 to record part of a screen, with audio from various sources`

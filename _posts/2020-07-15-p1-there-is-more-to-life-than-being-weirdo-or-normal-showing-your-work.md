* There's more to life than being a weirdo, being normal or showing your work aka not sure what to make of [Meredith L. Patterson's: When Nerds Collide
My intersectionality will have weirdoes or it will be bullshit](https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c) (via [Richard's tweet](https://twitter.com/sillygwailo/status/1283424365200187396))
  * e.g. walking, bicycling, doing nothing just for the sake of doing nothing, etc
* writing code seemed weird back in 1977 to me, now it's been corrupted  by both "weirdos" and "normals"  to make [the miasma of the internet](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/12/p1-the-whole-miasma-of-the-internet/)
  * weirdo is the new normal if you ask me and that's not 100% a good thing! because decency is not weird often and mundanity is often better than being weird!

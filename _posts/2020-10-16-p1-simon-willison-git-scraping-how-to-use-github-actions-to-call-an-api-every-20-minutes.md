*   [Git scraping: track changes over time by scraping to a Git repository](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) aka how to use github actions to call an API every 20 minutes; the git action is a Linux cron job that calls curl to get the data and if it has changed to commit to github ; see also t[his Hacker News thread for more examples](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1314654153646383104).

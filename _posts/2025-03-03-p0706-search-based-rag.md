>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for adding extra “knowledge” to systems built on LLMs, allowing them to answer questions against custom information not included in their training data. A common way to implement this is to take a question from a user, translate that into a set of search queries, run those against a search engine and then feed the results back into the LLM to generate an answer.

>I built a basic version of this pattern against the brand new Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model, using SQLite full-text search running in Datasette as the search backend and Val Town as the prototyping platform.

>The implementation took just over an hour, during a live coding session with Val.Town founder Steve Krouse. I was the latest guest on Steve’s live streaming series where he invites people to hack on projects with his help

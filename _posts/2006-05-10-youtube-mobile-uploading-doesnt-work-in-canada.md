YouTube Mobile Uploading doesn't work in Canada, *sigh*. Well at least it doesn't work with Fido (in my experiments anyway. I'd love to be proven wrong) since <a href="http://www.fido.ca/portal/en/support/mms.shtml#eight">Fido MMS can only handle 300K</a> and most videos are at least 1MB.

Supporting MMS is ridiculous, YouTube! Nobody uses MMS in North America (well at least no adults, youths and crazy Web 2.0 people that I know). Please support <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/01/27/blip-tv-upgrades-software-to-support-nokia-n70-mp4-videos">video upload using email like the fantastic blip.tv does</a>!

YouTube announced a new feature today that allows uploading of videos from a mobile device that supports Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). Users need to create a moblie profile before uploading videos. Sign up here.

<br />I use my camera phone to upload pictures directly to Flickr all the time (yesterday’s banana-yellow ridiculous rental car, for example). If my phone had the ability to create video, I’d be using this for YouTube all the time, too.

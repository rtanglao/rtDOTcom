All apps (especially sharing and authoring apps) will be location enabled in the future.  This is just the start.

From <a href="http://blog.ziffdavis.com/coursey/archive/2004/03/24/251.aspx">MapPoint Location Server debuts (Part 1) </a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>I agree with people who described this as a &#8220;watershed event&#8220; in making location-enabled applications available to American (and Canadian)&#160;businesses at prices they can afford. If your business involves sending people to customer locations, whether on service calls, deliveries, or &#8220;when news happens&#8220; this is technology you can use. Maybe not immediately, as we are still a bit on the bleeding edge, but now is the time to get this on your radar and plan for 2005 and beyond.

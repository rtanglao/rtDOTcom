[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Jan 5, 2021. [Simon Willison: DALL·E: Creating Images from Text](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Jan/5/dalle-creating-images-from-text/) (via [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25649557)) “DALL·E is a 12-billion parameter version of GPT-3 trained to generate images from text descriptions, using a dataset of text–image pairs.”. The examples in this paper are astonishing—“an illustration of a baby daikon radish in a tutu walking a dog” generates exactly that.  <--- does it work for anybody or is it paywalled? Sounds like access is limited to a "lucky few". "AI" segregation for tech elites for the loss!

Gotta love Dare.  Agree or disgree with him; he manages to get some great discussion going,  Just read the comments to <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=eb9c26a4-31c3-4bcc-9b03-fce4d7766ad8">his post</a>.

From <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=eb9c26a4-31c3-4bcc-9b03-fce4d7766ad8">The RSS Sky is Falling...Again</a>:

This is becoming a broken record. Every couple of months some web site that hasn't properly prepared for the amount of bandwidth consumed by having a popular RSS feed loudly complains and the usual suspects complain that RSS is broken. This time the culprit is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/">Weblogs @ ASP.NET</a> and their mistake was <a href="http://www.imc.org/atom-syntax/mail-archive/msg09707.html">not providing HTTP compression to clients speaking HTTP 1.0</a>. This meant that they couldn't get the benefits of HTTP compression when talking to popular aggregators like Straw, FeedDemon, SharpReader, NewsGator and RSS Bandit. No wonder their bandwidth usage was so high.
<br />
<br />But lets ignore that the site wasn't properly configured enough to utilize all the bandwidth saving capabilities of HTTP. Instead lets assume Weblogs @ ASP.NET had done all the right things but was still getting to much bandwidth being consumed. Mark Nottingham covered this ground in his post <strong>The Syndication Sky is Falling!</strong>

title: "Funkwhale - grooveshark inspired decentralized music"
---
* "[Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio/) is a community-driven project that lets you listen and share music and audio within a decentralized, open network - Instances can be federated with the ActivityPub protocol." Super cool, started 4 years ago roughly i.e. sometime in 2017!
* From the founder's [Reddit AMA 9 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/fkvah3/funkwhale_a_freeopensource_musicaudio_server_ive/):
  * "**In a nutshell, you can use Funkwhale to build your own, private Spotify**. Once the Funkwhale server (a.k.a. pod) [is deployed](https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/), you can upload your music on it (or import it from the server through a command-line interface), build playlists, favorites, search within your collection, etc. You can also invite other people on your pod so they  can enjoy the service."
  * "While you can definitely use Funkwhale to listen to music and audio created by others (this is the core use case), **you can also use it as an alternative to SoundCloud, to publish your own work.**"
* Would love to have the time to run my own instance in the cloud!
* Grooveshark died in 2015. RIP I loved it!
* Found via a demo last week at element.io

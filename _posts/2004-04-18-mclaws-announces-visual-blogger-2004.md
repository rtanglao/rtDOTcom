Very cool.  In the future you will be able to blog from every app that you use whether it's  your development environment (like Visual Studio or Eclispe) or your Wordprocessor or your spreadsheet or...

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Robert McLaws is working on Visual Blogger 2004. This is going to be an awesome way to edit a weblog. McLaws was telling me about the Visual Studio integration. Here's how it'll work. Highlight a few lines of code in Visual Studio that you want to blog about and right click. Choose "blog this" and Visual Blogger 2004 will open up, with the lines of code already in the editor, and will let you publish those lines of code to your blog with comments.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

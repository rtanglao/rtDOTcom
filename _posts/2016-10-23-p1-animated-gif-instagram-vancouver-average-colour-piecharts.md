## Pontifications

This animated GIF thing is still fun! There is something about circles! Gray makes up most of the piecharts! Hmmm :-)

Full context see [my animated GIF git repo and scroll down to October 23, 2016](https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-animated-gifs):

* ```mkdir 2016-10-23```
* ```cd !$```
* ```cp /Users/rtanglao/Dropbox/GIT/2016-r-rtgram/JANUARY2016/colourname*.png .```
* ```ls -1 *.png >2016-january-piecharts.txt```
* ```gm convert -loop 50 -delay 20 -scale 1024x512 @2016-january-piecharts.txt 2016-january-instagram-vancouver-average-colour-piecharts```

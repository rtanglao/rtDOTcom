[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 28, 2022 16:11  [grunfink/snac2: A simple, minimalistic ActivityPub instance (2.x, C) -  snac2 - Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2) <-- QUOTE `This program runs as a daemon (proxied by a TLS-enabled real httpd server) and provides the basic services for a Fediverse / ActivityPub instance (sharing messages and stuff from/to other systems like Mastodon, Pleroma, Friendica, etc.). This is not the manual; man pages snac(1) (user manual), snac(5) (formats) and snac(8) (administrator manual) are what you are looking for.
snac stands for Social Networks Are Crap.` <-- Except for being written in C :-), this sounds great! <--- there's a MacPort! https://ports.macports.org/port/snac/details/

[Belated Happy Canada Day](https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/881540620359057408)! You've made us great Canada despite [our many flaws](https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21724386-governments-intentions-are-good-righting-historic-wrong-will-take-sustained) as a country! And for that we will all be forever grateful. #lucky #thanks

## Pontifications
 
 * Having Surface Book 2 WiFi 802.11ac issues: ```ipconfig /release``` and then ```ipconfig /renew``` in powershell seems to fix it
	 * the above fix was found by a google search that turned up reddit:[New Surface Book 2, same BS Marvell WiFi fails... (help) ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/7dtr5b/new_surface_book_2_same_bs_marvell_wifi_fails_help/) 
	 * Note: I don't have these issues with 802.11ac wifi on OS X, Android or iOS (so it's probably driver related?!?)

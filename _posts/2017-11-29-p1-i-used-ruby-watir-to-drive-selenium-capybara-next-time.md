## Pontifications

* For my [London Drugs Scraping photo downloads script](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/11/22/p1-add-command-line-parameters-london-drugs-photo-downloading-scraping-script/), I used the ruby watir gem instead of [capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara/) because I couldn't get capybara to work?!?!
* There is a [nice capybara tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/scraping-with-capybara.html), I need to try capybara next time.
* Finally here are some capybara versus watir posts: [github watir issue](https://github.com/watir/watir/issues/444), [A tale of three ruby automated testing APIs (redux)](https://watirmelon.com/2011/12/03/a-tale-of-three-ruby-automated-testing-apis-redux/)

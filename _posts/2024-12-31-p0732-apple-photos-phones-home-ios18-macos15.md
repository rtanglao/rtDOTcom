[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Dec 31, 2024 07:32 [Me:: HowTo: Enhanced Visual Search off on your iPhone/iPad: Settings > Apps > Photos > slide 'Enhanced Visual Search' to the left to disable it Jeff Johnson:: Apple Photos phones home on iOS 18 and macOS 15](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/12/3.html) <-- **QUOTE**: `This morning while perusing the settings of a bunch of apps on my iPhone, I discovered a neaw setting for Photos that was enabled by default: Enhanced Visual Search. (I manually disabled it before taking the screenshot below.)` <-- Seems like a pointless feature so I turned it off! Yet another proof that Apple is better than most but still has privacy issues.

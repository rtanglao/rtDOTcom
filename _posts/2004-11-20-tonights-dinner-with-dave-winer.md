A small, intimate gathering.  Excellent discussion about OPML, outlining, podcasting, the good 'ole Manila days back in late 1999, etc.  We missed <a href="http://tomalak.org/">Lawrence</a> (Dave and Lawrence worked together but have never met, someday!). Thanks to <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave</a> for coming out even though he was still a wee bit sick.

Tonight, in a small Vietnamese restaurant on the east side, about twenty people had dinner with Dave Winer. I accidentally ate tripe, and intentionally tried frog legs (yep, like chicken). A good time was had by all. Here are the attendees. Let me apologize in advance to those I missed, or whose URLs are missing. Please comment or email me and I'll amend this list.

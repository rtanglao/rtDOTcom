Finally.  What Andy said!

From <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2004/05/an_objective_look_at_table_based_vs_css_based_design/index.php#comments">Andy Budd::Blogography: An Objective Look at Table Based vs. CSS Based Design</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>Web standards and CSS based design are defiantly the way forward. However in our rush to advocate these &#8220;new&#8221; techniques, we may end up believing our own hyperbole. Build something up enough and the reality will always fall short of our expectations. By taking a dogmatic approach we risk alienating the very people we are trying to convince.

Table based design will be around for a long time. To encourage developer buy-in we need to lead by example and help reduce the barriers to entry. Not create new barriers. We need to be honest and up-front about the benefits as well as the cost. Developing CSS sites can be hard and it can time consuming. In certain circumstances using tables for layout can make much more sense than CSS.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

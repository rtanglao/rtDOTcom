* Prediction: Artificial General Intelligence won't be written in [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) (more likely to happen is widespread stuff like this: "The 2.0 stack can fail in unintuitive and embarrassing ways ,or worse, they can “silently fail”, e.g., by silently adopting biases in their training data, which are very difficult to properly analyze and examine when their sizes are easily in the millions in most cases.") and [AGI won't happen before 2029](http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/03/11/p1-artificial-general-intelligence-wont-happen-before-2029/)

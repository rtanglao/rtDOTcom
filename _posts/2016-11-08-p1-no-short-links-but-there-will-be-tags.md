title: There won't be short links but there will be tags

tl;dr: Short links to other sites break the internet so I won't have those, but there will be tags

## Pontifications

Following up from [yesterday's no newsletter and other stuff I won't have](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/07/p1-No-email-newsletter-and-other-accoutrements/):

* I won't have shortened links to other sites so I can track if you click on them. That breaks the internet because it slows things down and really do I need that info? Do you? I can see the need for short links to your stuff to put on a bus or billboard :-) but that's it!
* There will be tags like flickr, and instagram and twitter, I've just been too lazy :-) to figure out how to do them.

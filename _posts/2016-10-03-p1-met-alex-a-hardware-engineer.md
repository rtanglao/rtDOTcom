title: Met Alex, a hardware engineer, at Revolver

## Pontifications

* [Alex](https://twitter.com/alexwarrior) is a hardware engineer, a bicyclist and good person :-).
* He knows embedded systems, electronics and how to make circuit boards (and much more that I don't know about I bet :-) !).
* This means he can help me with my hardware projects like the [Minimum Perceptible Difference Brooch](http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/10/02/p1-minimum-perceptible-difference-brooch/)! Yay!
* Here's a photo of Alex (some day I'll take a picture of Alex in those fab yellow sun glasses that are in his fab twitter profile pic!!!!) that I took at archive by [Revolver](http://revolvercoffee.ca/):

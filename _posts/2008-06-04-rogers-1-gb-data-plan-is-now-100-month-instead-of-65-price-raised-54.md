<p>Sorry, Rogers raising prices by 54% from $65 to $100/month for 1GB of mobile data is unacceptable. This unfortunately confirms <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2008/06/02/12-hours-with-rogers-n95-8gb-nam-get-an-unlocked-one-instead">Danny's experience</a>.</p>From <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2008/06/04/rogers-vision-sucks/"><cite>Rogers “Vision” sucks — Alec Saunders SquawkBox</cite></a>:

  <p>the $65/month data plan which I’ve written about previously has gone away. Rogers will still give you 1 G of mobile data, but now they want $100/month. Hello? When the rest of the world has data rates that are plunging like a stone, Jolly Rogers is cranking their rates up. Sure smells like a monopoly to me. Is anyone at Industry Canada paying attention? Needless to say, I chose to stick with my pre-existing $65/month “deal”.</p>

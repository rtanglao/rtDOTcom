It is possible to have a far less violent country that takes care of their fellow citizens better through universal healthcare and other things and that "innovates". Japan is just one example of country that is better on what many people value: it is safer and healthier and people have time for hobbies ie doing something other than working for 50 weeks a year like most i.e. unprivileged ðŸ‡¦mericans :-) who get 2 or 3 weeks of holidays at the most and don't have the money to buy the stuff that Mr. Smith cares so much about!

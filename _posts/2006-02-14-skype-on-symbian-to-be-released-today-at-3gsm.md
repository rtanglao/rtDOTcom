<p>Skype on Symbian to be released today (somebody send me a link, please!) at <a href="https://www.3gsmworldcongress.com/">3GSM</a> according to my "sources" (don't you hate it when people tell you that). It'll probably only work on the very latest phones on Symbian Series 60 so it will be a high end solution only but it points to the future. Since what's only on high end phones today in a couple of years migrates to lower end phones!</p>

<p>Awesome! I wish I could have thought of this.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/8435544887719633/">And The Winner Is… - The Social Software Weblog - socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com</a>:&lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;First, think about the value of the Wall Street Journal to business leaders. The value it provides is context — the Journal allows readers to see themselves in the context of the financial world each day, which enables more informed decision making.
              
With this in mind, think about your company as a microcosm of the financial world.  Can your employees see themselves in the context of the whole company? Would more informed decisions be made if employees and leaders had access to internal news sources?
 
Weblogs serve this need.  By making internal websites simple to update, weblogs allow individuals and teams to maintain online journals that chronicle projects inside the company. These professional journals make it easy to produce and access internal news, providing context to the company — context that can profoundly affect decision making.  In this way, weblogs allow employees and leaders to make more informed decisions through increasing their awareness of internal news and events.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<strong>UNQUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

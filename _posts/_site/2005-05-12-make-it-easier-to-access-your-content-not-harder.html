<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Here is a simple recipe for the content industry -- make it EASIER for consumers to get access to content, not harder. I know this is counter-intuitive, but what if consumers could go to the Internet and access the programming they cared about, whenever and wherever they wanted. What if you charged them a small amount of money or got them to agree to watch targeted advertising for each program? Would you need broadcast flags?</p></blockquote>

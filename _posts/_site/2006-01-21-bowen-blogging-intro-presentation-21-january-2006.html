<p>For those who were at the <a href="http://bryght.com/events/intro-to-blogging-on-bowen-island">Bowen Island Blogging Intro</a> today, thank-you! I learned that single sign on/identity is really an issue for real people. Watching them endure the process of giving their first and last name, think of a screen name and email address multiple times as well as going through the email verification dance for <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a>, <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. Nothing against these services, it's just the gruesome reality of coming up with multiple userids on multiple systems today. Give the people what they want and need: <a href="http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/">Identity 2.0!</a> </p>
<p>Anyways, attached is the presentation in <a href="/rt/system/files?file=BowenBlogIntro21Jan2006_0.pdf">PDF</a> and <a href="/rt/system/files?file=BowenBlogIntro21Jan2006.key.zip">Keynote</a> (for Mac people) form and the outline of the presentation notes is below. </p>
<p>As well I will tag any links we mentioned using an online bookmark service called <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> with the tag: bowenblogintro. You can can get all the links on the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/bowenblogintro">bowenblogintro tag page</a> as well as subscribe to the <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/bowenblogintro">bowenblogintro tag RSS feed</a> for updates. </p>

<p>Why? It feels faster and the middle button of my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer Optical  mouse works for popping new windows or tabs.  But I will probably switch to Firefox as my default browser when it goes 1.0 because it just keeps getting faster and I doubt Safari can catch up!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/03/19/12OPstrategic_1.html">InfoWorld: Firefox fills the IE void: March 19, 2004: By Jon Udell : APPLICATION_DEVELOPMENT : APPLICATIONS : PLATFORMS : WEB_SERVICES</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Ironically, although Microsoft cited competition with Apple&#8217;s Safari as the reason for killing IE for the Mac, I&#8217;ve abandoned Safari on OS X for the same reason I&#8217;ve abandoned IE on Windows. Firefox does more, it&#8217;s moving faster, and &#8212; here&#8217;s the kicker &#8212; it runs identically on Windows, OS X, and Linux.</blockquote>

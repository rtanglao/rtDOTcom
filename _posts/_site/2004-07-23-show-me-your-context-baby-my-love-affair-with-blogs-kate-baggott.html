<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>If the pen is still mightier than the sword, then the pen has been dulled, emptied and badly refilled by traditional media. Blogs, as yet, are the only sign of the new revolution, the new democracy, and the new nervous system. New media blogs are our one true hope if their legions expand and voices of reason are heard. I believe in the wisdom and might of blogs and bloggers, but I believe it with the same fear and hope that lovers do when they cling to each other in any fresh spring romance. Like the lovers, I do not know if my belief is ultimately sustainable or just naive, but like the lovers I will let it bloom in all its good feeling.</blockquote>

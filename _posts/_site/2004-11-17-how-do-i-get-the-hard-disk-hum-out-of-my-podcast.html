Played around with a podcast last night for an hour and I actually recorded one but I am not releasing it because there is an annoying background hum from the disk.
</p>
<p>
How do I remove the hum of my hard disk from my podcast? I am looking for an inexpensive and quick solution if one exists.  Don't want to be doing heavy duty audio stuff that requires a lot of time.
</p>
<p>
Better yet, how do I prevent this hum from occurring in the first place? I have set my Processor Performance to Highest in the Energy Save System Preference.
</p>
<p>
I am using Mac OS 10.3.5 on a 15" Powerbook and GarageBand to record.  It's weird because <a href="http://www.barbandroland.com/blog/_archives/2004/11/2/173384.html">my first podcast</a> didn't have this problem and I used the identical setup.
</p>
<p>
My next attempt will try <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>.  Maybe it won't have this problem.
</p>
<p>
Any help would be appreciated.

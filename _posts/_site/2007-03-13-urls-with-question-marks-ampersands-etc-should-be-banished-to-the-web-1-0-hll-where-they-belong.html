<p> URLs with question marks, ampersands, etc should be banished to the Web 1.0 h*ll where they belong. I&#39;ve been preaching the <a href="http://bryght.com/node/50">clean URL gospel</a> for years but if I see one more WordPress blog with &quot;?p&quot; or one more Drupal site with &quot;?q&quot;, I&#39;ll scream :-) Seriously if your webhost or your tech gal/guy can&#39;t figure out how to use clean URLs, find somebody else. It&#39;s 2007! </p>

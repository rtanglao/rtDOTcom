<p> At <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/05/08/vancouver-super-happy-dev-house-at-bryght-sponsored-by-socialtext">shdhvan</a> on Friday, <a href="http://liz-henry.blogspot.com/">Liz Henry</a> (who is most excellent and knowledgeable by the way!) and I started riffing on forums and communities and came up with the following pseudo-manifesto for social software:</p>
<ol> <li>everything must be subscribable by RSS and email:  i) author  ii) tags  iii) topics</li> <li> google like search of all the text</li> <li>everything must have permalinks with clean urls</li> <li>all urls must be hackable e.g. coolwiki.com/food/restaurants/vancouver/dona-cata - I should be able to remove &#39;dona-cata&#39; and get a list of all Vancouver restaurants</li> </ol>
<p>Surprise, surprise, most wikis and most content management systems and blog systems like Socialtext, Drupal and Wordpress do most of the above things; most forums don&#39;t. Which is why forums make me uncomfortable; lots of forums have great content  but they are impossible to follow, ugly and have really bad 1990s style URLs replete with question marks and ampersands which are not hackable.</p>

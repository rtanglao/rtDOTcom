<p>Now running Drupal 7 courtesy of <a href="http://justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> (thanks!), who I had the privilege to work with at Bryght and Raincity Studios. Richard, like myself, has been working with Drupal since 2004 (wow, has it been that long?) and he has a deep technical knowledge of both working with, and administering Drupal sites as well as debugging and writing Drupal code and modules. And Richard is a gifted trainer &amp; educator as Iâ€™ve experienced first hand watching him working with social media newbies at <a href="http://2011.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a> and at Drupal events helping out Drupal novices.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:It looks like blip.tv took the FLV that the Brightcove Publishpod encoded out of my MP4 (if <a href="http://blip.tv/file/95910/">the video below doesn't work, go to my blip.tv post to play it!</a>):</p>

It's an awesome video but its 100MB (since I did it at 640x480 30fps MPEG4). I tried to upload it to <a href="http://studio.brightcove.com/">Brightcove</a> (since I know it won't work on blip.tv, my fav service; file is too big) but it didn't work. The Brightcove Mac OS X uploader, Brightcove Publishpod, successfully encoded the MP4 to flash video aka FLV but the sites says it's processing (and it's been saying that for 24 hours!).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I guess I'll try Google Video. I did search the Brightcove knowledge base and FAQs but found no documentation for video file upload limits or that MPEG4 (and yes I know there are many variants of MPEG4 and perhaps Nokia's is not supported) was not supported.  Ah well early days. Brightcove sounds great (<a href="http://blog.brightcove.com/blog/2006/10/robin_good_revi.html">Robin Good's Brightcove review</a> makes it sound wonderful) but I couldn't get it to work. &lt;/p&gt;

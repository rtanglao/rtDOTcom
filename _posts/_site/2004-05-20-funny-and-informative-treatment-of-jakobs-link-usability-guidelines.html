<p>Amazing. Jakob should follow this advice on his site. It would me it a lot more usable!  Doctor heal thyself!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Last Monday, to much fanfare, Nielsen published the second part to his guidelines on the display of links. I was as shocked as anyone by it. He actually made sense!

Well, color me paranoid. I&#8217;m at loss. Beyond the awkward language, beyond the retina-burning presentation, and beyond a few misused design terms, I actually got from the King of Usability what I have been asking for all this time.

Life is good sometimes.

So, as you can see, I&#8217;ve implemented a few of the suggestions found in Nielsen&#8217;s Alertbox. I have added dotted underlines to my links, even though they look like shoddy, gnarly dashes in Internet Explorer, and I&#8217;ve changed the color of visited links to be a darker shade of red to distinguish them. I&#8217;m getting religion.

Further, in the spirit of sharing, I decided I&#8217;d gather up some knowledgeable designers and help Nielsen in return with a little bit of design advice. The Design Fab Five, right here, right now.</blockquote>

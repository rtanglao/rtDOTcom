<p> Technology willing, <a href="http://www.hockeynw.com/more-dave">Dave Olson</a> and I and his awesome cast of hockey pundits will be doing a live <a href="http://www.hockeynw.com/">Canucks Outsider</a>  webcast using <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream.tv</a> Saturday at 5p.m. Pacific to coincide with Game 6 of the Canucks/Dallas Series. Dave and the gang will be commenting live on the game on video over the internet! </p>
<p> Fingers crossed that there won&#39;t be a Game 6. If there&#39;s no Game 6 we&#39;ll still go live for a couple of hours as I am sure we&#39;ll have tons to say about the quest for the Stanley Cup. </p>
<p> [Gear help: If anybody has a 4 mike mixer and a couple of mics, I&#39;d love to borrow them for our &#39;cast. Contact me roland AT rolandtanglao.com or call me at 694 729 7924 OR leave a comment]. </p>

<p>On the night before I receive my N97 from Nokia WOM World for a brief trial, just for fun I looked back at my <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2008/12/01/nokia-reveal-insanely-great-device-nokia-world-wednesday-dec-3-2008">N999 concept/vision from December 1, 2008</a>. And what the heck here's the N999 concept updated for July 2009 (notable updates are in <strong>bold</strong>):</p>
<ol><li>screen with as many pixels as the 5800 Tube or iPhone (<strong>sorry but QVGA doesn't cut it in 2009</strong>!)</li><li><a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2007/07/21/1312">S60 simplified and fixed as Rui describes</a></li><li>5 megapixel camera with cover and Xenon flash with 3x optical zoom and 640x480 30fps video (basically re-use the awesome N82 camera hardware and software and <strong>combine with the N93 optical zoom</strong>)</li><li>Quad band GSM and 3G (i.e. works on Rogers and AT&amp;T in North America AND European 3G out of the box just like the N85, no funky North American model)</li><li>Built in ShoZu (with 10MB limit removed for 3G and WiFi, make the limit 50-200MB for 3G and WiFi) - killer app for photographers and videobloggers - <strong>Qik is built&nbsp; into the N97 why not ShoZu</strong>? (I can't stand Share Online's limit of 6 photos at a time since I take over 50 a day; hope it's removed on the N97)</li><li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Bult-in Qik (killer app for videobloggers!) - </span><strong>Qik is built&nbsp; into the N97 can't wait to try it</strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">!<br /></span></li><li>Awesome web browser (Nokia's Web Kit browser was great in 2006, it is now far behind Apple's)</li><li>Lots of available RAM (as much as the N95 8GB please!), 8GB storage on built-in card -<strong> Reviews are mixed on the N97, sounds like it has a lot of RAM (more than the N95 8GB)&nbsp; but with widgets it takes up a lot more.</strong> - I doubt I will use widgets!</li><li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Built in Nokia viNes to take advantage of Nokia's great GPS hardware (killer GPS app!) - </span><strong>viNes apears to be dead. Nokia Sports Tracker appears to be alive, so I'd rather have that built-in</strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><br /></span></li><li>Built in Twitter App i.e. <strong>built in <a href="http://mobileways.de/products/gravity/gravity/">Gravity</a></strong></li></ol>
<p>Now I know the above list is not possible given today's processors and batteries but in that case I can live without optical zoom! Everything else is doable as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I still don't need:</p>
<ol><li>QWERTY keyboard - <strong>I'd rather have an awesome camera and flash than a touch or QWERTY keyboard</strong>. And for me touch keyboards are just as good as QWERTY.</li><li>Email (Email is dead to me<strong> </strong>(<strong>ok email isn't dead</strong> but my resolution is to take any email thread&nbsp; that I need to keep that has more than 2 replies to a wiki or blog); I continue to use it&nbsp; for work and to communicate with "normal" folks!) -<strong> If the browser is as good as the iPhone's, then webmail clients work just fine.</strong></li><li>Touch (would be nice, but not convinced Nokia has the software chops for this; I am not interested in S60 transmogrified with touch, I would prefer touch to be part of a totally revamped user interface that's NOT S60.) - <strong>Unfortunately it appears that Nokia's current touch interface s*cks. I hope I am proven wrong by my N97 trial.</strong></li><li>Micro SD card slot</li><li>Calendar (would be nice but that's what my laptop is for :-) !) - <strong>Again with a good enough browser a web client would be good enough</strong>)</li><li>IM (Twitter is IM enough for me <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><strong>and I am fine with using it in the browser</strong></span>)</li><li>VOIP is dead to me except for Skype</li><li>MMS - I am not convinced I need it, I can always use ShoZu email photos :-) but I was <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/05/16/sms-is-dead-twitter-proves-it">wrong about SMS</a> (so maybe I am wrong about MMS) -<strong> I am pretty sure I am wrong about MMS and I am pretty sure (unfortunately) I will be MMSing my relatives with pictures since they all finally seem to have MMS plans and devices and none of my luddite :-) relatives still use flickr or any of the other public or private photosharing sites!<br /></strong></li></ol>

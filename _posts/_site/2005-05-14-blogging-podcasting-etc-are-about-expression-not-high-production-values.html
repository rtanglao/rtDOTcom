<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Dave’s podcast is an 18 minute ramble so if you are in a hurry here’s <a href="http://biketrouble.typepad.com/bike_trouble/2005/05/kindergarten_po.html">Mark’s Reader’s Digest :-) version</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>To summarize - and save you the bother of listening to Dave ramble for 18 whole minutes, people don't criticize kindergarten kid's drawings because they don't want to discourage them from being creative. And so likewise, early podcasters should not be criticized on the basis of production values because we want to see a thousand flowers bloom etc etc*

<p>Dave really nailed it in <a href="http://mp3.morningcoffeenotes.com/cnMay13.mp3">this morning's coffee notes</a> response to <a href="http://radioopensource.org/wp-content/open_source_pilot_1.mp3">Christopher Lydon Open Source Radio pilot</a>.

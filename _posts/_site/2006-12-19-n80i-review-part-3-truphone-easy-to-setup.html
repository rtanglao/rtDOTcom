<p> <a href="http://www.truphone.com/">Truphone</a> was easy to setup (<a href="http://saunderslog.com/2006/12/16/calling-for-free-on-my-mobile/">Alec Saunders has a nice post about it</a>) if you are familiar with WiFi on series 60 phones (getting much closer to something normal people can use!) and I verified it works with my land line. Nokia put the VoIP software in all of your WiFi phones not just the N80i! </p>
<p> I encountered a minor bug when trying to add $5 USD to my account with PayPal (PayPal worked but the redirect back to Truphone&#39;s site failed! Cheese Louise, it&#39;s 2006 why is ecommerce so hard!) but other than that it looks like a solid product. </p>
<p> Now the real test: cheap calls to Holland, and maybe even China and South Africa. </p>
<p> If you want to check it out call +13604880717 or better yet get an E61 or N80i and call me for free via Truphone! </p>

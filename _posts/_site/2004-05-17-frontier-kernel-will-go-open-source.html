<p>Great news. Hopefully this will provide the basis for a re-energizing of Radio, Manila and Frontier.  If not, at least it will be out there for others to build from and learn if nothing else!</p>

<blockquote>At some point in the next few months, there will be an open source release of the Frontier kernel. Not sure what license it'll use. There won't be any grand expectations of what kind of community will develop. Even if no bugs get fixed, if no features get added, if no new OSes are supported, it will be worth it, because its future will be assured. That's the point Ted makes, and that's my reasoning behind this.

We decided this quite some time ago, but waited for the right moment to start discussing it publicly. It seems now is the right time, or as good a time as any.</blockquote>

<p> I spoke too soon in <a href="/rt/archives/2006/07/07/n91-review-part-7-firmware-blues-cured-by-reformatting-hard-disk">Part 7</a> of this review. The beta version of ShoZu started crashing shortly after I posted part 7. Aaargh. All is not lost. I am making my way to the Nokia lab in Burnaby tomorrow morning where my N91 firmware will be upgraded from V1.00.028.13 29.03.06 RM-43  to the<a href="http://www.mobile9.com/invboard/index.php?s=49cee2d156733360c01b9c0df710f5fa&amp;amp;showtopic=23700&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=211652"> latest version V1.10.030 05-05-06 RM-43 or later</a> (thanks to <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy Abramson</a> for arranging this because this would not have happened through official channels since the N91 is not sold in Canada!). Apparently the latest version fixes the ShoZu crashing problem as well as the theme reset problem and other various issues. Fingers crossed! </p>

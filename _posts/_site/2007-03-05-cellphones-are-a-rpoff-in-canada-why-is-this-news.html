<blockquote> The report breaks the market into three categories of users. The high-end business user, who uses 1,200 minutes of voice plus data monthly, pays 150 per cent more than a subscriber in the United States. <br /> <br />The average user, defined as someone using 500 minutes a month, pays a 33-per-cent premium. And the light user, someone who keeps the phone packed away most of the month and spurns add-on features such as voice mail and call display, actually comes out ahead, paying 27 per cent less. <br /> <br />However, Canadians pay more in all three categories when compared with Europeans, the report said. <br /> <br />&ldquo;Canadians aren&#39;t tech laggards, as has been suggested in recent discussions on the country&#39;s state of wireless phone competition. Instead, they are rational economic beings. Canadians hesitate to buy cellphones or to hit the send button on a cellphone knowing full well the cost at the end of the month will be breathtaking,&rdquo; it said. </blockquote>

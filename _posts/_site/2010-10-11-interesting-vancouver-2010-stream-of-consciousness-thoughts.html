<p>Thanks to the excellent organizers of <a href="http://interestingvancouver.com/">Interesting Vancouver 2010</a> for giving me a chance to present on <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/ccc">Lessons from 50,000 Cameraphone photos:Create Coolness Constantly</a> and for the great event. The right (almost impossible to do but I think the organizers accomplished this!) mix of people and thought provoking topics and fun food in an intimate setting.</p>
<p>The usual random stream of consciousness post-event thoughts:</p>
<ul><li>Can't disagree with JJ Lee about suits. In particular, I think that 99% of Canadian men look better in sports jackets and suits than their normal garb but that's just me :-)</li><li>Leanne Prain and yarn bombing are awesome as always!!!!!</li><li>Cory Weeds - His passion for jazz and music is infectious and made me dream of a world where everybody could lindy hop to 21st century live jazz instead of awesome recordings from the the 1920s-50s</li><li>Lisa Salazar's invocation of the Bible is inspirational even if you (like myself) are no longer a believer.</li><li>Kuba Om's passion is making the world a better place; one juicy groove at a time.</li><li>Dustin Rivers - As an armchair linguist :-), I was really looking forward to hearing you! Next time?</li><li>Anthony Nicalo had me dreaming (again!) of a world powered by food that comes from the heart rather than big food.</li><li>Amanda Gibbs - The Museum of Vancouver is rocking! Loved the Fluevog and the local food and the bicycling shows. Can't wait to see MOV.next :-)</li></ul>

<p>Very cool hack! 
From <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2004/04/14/atomwiki.html">XML.com: An Atom-Powered Wiki</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Using Python and the XPath facilities of libxml2, it was  straightforward to build an AtomAPI implementation for a  wiki. There isn't even very much code: atom.cgi is  just 146 lines of code, while atomfeed.cgi is just  122 lines.

This is just a basic client that does the minimum to support the  AtomAPI. In a future article the way the server handles HTTP can  be enhanced to provide significant performance boosts by using the  full capabilities of HTTP. In addition, the SOAP enabling of the  server will require some changes. After that we can add the  ability to edit the wiki's templates.</blockquote>

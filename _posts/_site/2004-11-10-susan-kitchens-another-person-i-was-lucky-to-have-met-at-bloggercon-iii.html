As some of the earliest <a href="http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a> users and stalwarts, <a href="http://www.2020hindsight.org/">Susan</a> and I go a long way back, virtually that is :-) It was great to finally meet her and find out that she truly is the vivacious and spirited person she "plays on her blog" and much more! And we had a long and fun chat after Jing Jing on Saturday.  Full of ideas and energy, Susan is, expect to hear more from here!

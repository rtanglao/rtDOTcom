This last week <a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/view/123">I really enjoyed meeting with Dries again and meeting with a big chunk of the  Drupal community including the CivicSpace guys</a>.  It was exhausting but in the end it shows why tools like easy to update websites, blogs, CMSes and RSS are worth building: to build communities online and offline.

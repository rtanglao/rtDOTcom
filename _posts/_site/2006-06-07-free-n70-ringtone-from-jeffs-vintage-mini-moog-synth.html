<p>I recorded a cheesy ringtone (see attached) on my friend Jeff Needham's vintage <a href="http://www.synthmuseum.com/moog/moomini01.html">Minimoog</a> Synth when I was staying at their Sunnyvale home last week for <a href="http://netsquared.org/">NetSquared</a>. It's public domain and low quality :-) and should work on other Series 60 phones. Enjoy!</p>

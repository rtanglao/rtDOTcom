<p>Simply right-click on any flash movie in ustream.tv (e.g. the one on the home page of ustream.tv) and set the microphone and camera to&nbsp; your iSight or whatever you want and done. My guess is that sometimes the Adobe Flash camera recording applet has messed up default settings. Thanks for the excellent support, Chris!</p>

<div dir="ltr" align="left"><span>&quot;You may have have to  update your Flash setting, however. If you are finding that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your iSight isn&#39;t  working with Flash, right-click on any Flash movie and choose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Settings...&quot;,  then click on the camera icon. Choose &quot;IIDC FireWire Video&quot; from the menu. You  can also use the iSight for audio by clicking on the microphone icon and  choosing &quot;iSight&quot;.&quot;</span></div>

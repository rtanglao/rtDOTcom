<p>[CROSS POSTED from my <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/2364">Urban Vancouver Blog</a>] - Richmond to be precise. Vancouver is strange. We got lots of little unsung companies like <a href="http://www.ascalade.com/">Ascalade</a> doing cool stuff like this Skype phone but no huge defining cluster. I hope Bryght, Qumana, etc. are the start of Web 2.0 cluster.

</p>
<p>Another cool Vancouver business. Go <a href="http://www.ascalade.com/">Ascalade</a> go! If you don't know what <a href="http://skype.com/">Skype</a> is, think  of it as a cool way to make phone calls from your computer with computer to computer calls being absolutely free.</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>According to Tom's Networking, Linksys is about to unveil a Skype-only cordless phone called the CIT200. There's a Canadian angle as the unit will be made Richmond, B.C.-based Ascalade Communications, which recently raised C$40-million in an IPO. Ascalade makes a variety of wireless products such as digital cordless phones, VoIP phone systems, enterprise conferencing phones and baby monitors. The 2,000-employee company does all its manufacturing in China</blockquote>

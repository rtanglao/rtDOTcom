<p> Been thinking abut this since I saw <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kk/149957531/">Kris&#39;s packing photo</a> on the weekend.  I can&#39;t afford it at the moment but it sounds like the best way to go is with a huge bag with wheels to carry all your photo gear on a trip like the Lowe Pro (or like <a href="/rt/archives/2006/03/30/lowepro-computrekker-aw-backpack-is-what-kris-and-i-carry-all-our-photo-video-and-computer-gear">my Lowe Pro Computrekker</a> if you can&#39;t stand wheels) that <a href="http://www.thedigitalstory.com/blog/2006/05/review_lowepro_rolli.html">Derrick Story mentions</a> and then a huge fanny pack (bum bag for you Brits :-) !) like <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/bags.htm">the bag that Ken Rockwell uses</a> so you can quickly access the photo gear you have brought for that day&#39;s photo shoot. </p>

<p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p>
<blockquote> I didn&rsquo;t bring my whole kit and I had a lot of stuff with me on this trip &ndash; I don&rsquo;t need to go to the gym for a while now since I got a lot of weight training in Africa carrying my gear. I actually couldn&rsquo;t get everything in the Tamrac Expedition 7, so my wife put the Sigma 10-20mm, the Epson P-2000 and the chargers in her camera bag. </blockquote>

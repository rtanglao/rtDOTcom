<p>I would love to catch up with <a href="http://mamamusings.net/">Liz</a>, <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie</a>, <a href="http://smallthought.com/avi/">Avi</a>, et al and meet cool people like <a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/">Gus</a>, but I am too burnt out from 11 days in Europe at <a href="http://barcamp.org/index.cgi?BarCampAmsterdam">BarCamp Amsterdam</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/conference-amsterdam-2005">DrupalCon Amsterdam 2005</a> and <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">Euro OSCON</a>. Instead I will hang with the family (which believe it or not is even more fun than hanging with the geeks :-) !) and watch vicariously. Please podcast, videoblog and blog the conference!

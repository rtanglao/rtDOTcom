<p>I am doing a mobile study with Simon Fraser University and have the original N95 for a week.</p>
<p>&quot;Blink&quot; :-) reactions after 12 hours with an N95-1:</p>
<ol>   <li>The double slide *does* appear flimsy as reported by many others</li>    <li>It is much lighter than the N93</li>    <li>Limited battery life reported by others hasn&#39;t affected me yet</li>    <li>Not sure I like the multi-media key menu - after over 6 months with the N93, I am used to invoking ShoZu by hitting the multimedia key and then up; the N95 way (multi-media key and then use arrow keys to scroll to ShoZu) is slower and takes more keystrokes</li>    <li>ShoZu hasn&#39;t crashed on me yet ! Yay! But I have only taken about 20 or so pictures. I&#39;ll stress ShoZu more during my commute tomorrow morning by taking 40 or so photos during my 40 minute door to&nbsp; door commute</li>    <li>Love the hardware volume keys (which I believe the N91 had)! Wish the N93 had that.</li>    <li>Love the smaller form factor. Don&#39;t miss the optical zoom of the N93 yet.</li>    <li>Menus changed yet again on the N95 versus the N93. It&#39;s a bit disconcerting but not hard to find where things are!</li>    <li>Screen seems sharper</li>    <li>Photos seem better. Need to compare with N93. Haven&#39;t tried a video yet</li> </ol>

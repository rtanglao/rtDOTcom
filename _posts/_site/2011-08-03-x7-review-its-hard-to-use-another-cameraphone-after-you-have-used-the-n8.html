<p>At Nokia Unfenced II in Canmore, Alberta, Canada at the beginning of July (a fun event consisting of horseback riding, a challenging ropes course and other mayhem and hijinx which was impeccably and beautifully organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/missdd">Donna Suffling</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomhall14">Tom Hall</a> of <a href="http://www.womworld.com/nokia/">Womworld Nokia</a>; my thanks to Donna, Tom and Womworld for paying for the whole shebang and providing us review Nokia X7s!), I received the Nokia X7 for review. I tried to love the X7 but after the N8 I think it's really impossible for me to love another cameraphone fully unless it beats the N8's picture quality. It's all about the pictures for me and the N8's pictures are the best in spite of Symbian's many unfriendly eccentricities (check out the my X7 pictures for yourself: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157627221113664/">X7 Set 1</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157627221223122/">X7 Set 2</a>).</p>
<p>Loved:</p>
<ul><li>X7 build quality</li><li>Symbian Anna is getting easier to use (the eccentricities are very nearly all gone) but is it too little too late? Probably in my estimation but time will tell;</li></ul>
<p>Not loved:</p>
<ul><li>No lanyard slot (but I realize that most people don't carry their cameraphones around their neck for quick camera access)</li><li>Probably no lanyard slot because it's too heavy for wearing around your neck :-)</li><li>The <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11406_Camera_Nitty_Gritty_Supplement.php">EDoF</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">EOF</span> i.e. fixed focus&nbsp; camera. Sorry but when you can get an iPhone 3GS with macro and real focusing for&nbsp; free on contract, why would you settle for a fixed focus camera ?</li><li>Disappointed to find that the Symbian Anna Browser doesn't run my HTML5 map mashups made using the CloudMade API e.g. my map of Vancouver flickr photos taken <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2011/05/29/still-dont-have-real-time-geotagged-photo-web-2011-proof-lack-geotagged">the day the Vancouver Canucks beat the San Jose Sharks to advance to the 2011 Stanley Cup final</a> (but Android Web Kit browser, Firefox Mobile and Mobile Safari do and my guess is Opera Mobile on the X7 would work). When will Symbian get a real HTML5 modern built-in browser? Symbian Belle?</li></ul>

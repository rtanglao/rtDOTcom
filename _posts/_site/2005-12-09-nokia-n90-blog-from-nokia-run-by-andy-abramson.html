<p>Go <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy</a> go! Since the forthcoming N91 was designed in Vancouver, I hope some Vancouver based bloggers are involved in the official Nokia N91 Blog. Andy, I'd love to have an N91 on trial like <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/12/nokia_n90.html">Ross Mayfield</a> and blog about it when the time comes. Call me at 604 729 7924 or email roland AT rolandtanglao.com!</p>
<p> My qualifications? I bought a 7610 and have uploaded<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/7610"> 4576 photos to flickr</a> (and more every day) using <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/7610">Shozu</a> and Lifeblog.  And I plan on doing lots of videos once Shozu works with the 7610's videos (which I hope is real soon now)! </p>

<p> I am happy to report that the N73 is a quadband phone (<a href="http://www.skypejournal.com/blog/archives/2006/11/gsm_850_mhz_band_not_to_be_overlooked.php#comments">as reported by Skype Journal</a>) which supports both 850Mhz and EDGE. This means ShoZu uploads of photos are much faster (subjectively seems to be about twice as fast). Almost makes up for the absence of WiFi :P ! </p>

Why are blogs interesting?
-written by amateurs
- there are millions, there weren’t before
-people hard to study
-networks and links hard to study
-society - transformation of society not journalism
Webloggers want money
-learned from 19th century nothing is outside the economy
Webloggers want friends
It’s ok to write a blog that only your mother reads (Dan Bricklin)
-fine to have intimate communication for a few people
Ten Tips for a better weblog
- make good friends, find good enemies, write for a reason, use your archives (link!!!!), etc
How do we know that these are the right tips?
- blog research!
- doing it in the context of the academy and convince the academy that weblogs matter
-why not conduct research that matters to blogs?
-research&lt;-&gt;real weblogs&lt;-&gt;software
-research of real blogs is technorati and feedster
-don’t reach for the obvious (18 students from a class for an example)
- be wary of Hawthorne effect
Lots of interesting approaches
-closely read long-term weblogs e.g. Winer, Blood, Hall, Hourihan (use linguistic studies, literature)
-how do observables change (quantity)
-why are blogs abandoned
Does better writing make a better weblog?
- not abandoned
-large audience (pagerank)
-influence
-novices are not more interesting than everybody else, just easier to study
What do blogs cost?
-cost a lot of time, software
-labor is the main cost but labor matters
Can this be right?
- terrible investment
- terrible income (minimum wage)
- indirect compensation is the one that helps
Could alter the software to make it cheaper and easier to make money
We need Ethnography to deal with the flame wars
- add comments and trackbacks? wrong direction? attack rules of civility, lead to flame wars?
Blogrolls
-sharing flow, friends, networks
Internet is bits
- no mystical nature
- should know how blogs have resisted broadcast so we can replicate it
Fiction and authenticity
- Eastgate does hypertext fiction
Do we tell the truth on blogs?
-everything on Mark’s blog is true but carefully selected
Hypertextuality is the meme of blogs this year!
-trends: reclaiming archives
-need to find a way to make it easy to put things in categories and engage our archives in the conversation</p>

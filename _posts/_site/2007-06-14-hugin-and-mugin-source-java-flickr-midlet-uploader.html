<p>I've had many requests for the Hugin and Mugin source code (Java midlet to take pictures and upload them to flickr) written by my friend and super developer Simon and tested and evangelized by meÂ  but unfortunately the links to the old code are broken. So <a href="/rt/system/files?file=HuginMuginSrc.zip">download Hugin and Mugin here</a>!</p>

<p>I’ve been saying <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/2003/11/12.html#a5829">for</a> <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/2003/10/29.html#a5723">years</a> that RSS forms a large part of the Real Time Enterprise management console and although <a href="http://www.mkpress.com/RTEdesc.html">The Real Time Enterprise</a> probably doesn’t explicitly talk about RSS, I bet it has some great insights and ideas for using RSS in a real time enterprise.  Some day when I have time, I would love to read this book!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://metatime.blogspot.com/2004/08/real-time-enterprise.html">Internet Time Blog: The Real-Time Enterprise</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>The real-time enterprise is crystallizing out of a process-rich brew in which swim Web-enabled customer relationship management, supply-chain event management, enterprise relationship management, partner relationship management, content management, customer analytics, business intelligence, optimization, forecasting and simulation. Into the mix we can throw technologies, including application servers, enterprise application integration, Web services, microservers, event routers, enterprise portals, and digital dashboards&#8212;and at the heart is a new category of software, the business process management system."</blockquote>

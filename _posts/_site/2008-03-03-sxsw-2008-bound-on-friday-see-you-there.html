<a href="http://uncleweed.net/">Dave</a>, Scales,  and <a href="http://kriskrug.com/">Kris</a>,  are headed to SXSW on Thursday; Erik and I are headed to SXSW 2008  on Friday. We are gearing up for a fun web, music and business-packed week.</p>
<p>
I hope to finally meet in person some of the great online people I have met over the years such as <a href="http://crueltobekind.org/">Nicole Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.photojunkie.ca/">Rannie Turingan</a>
 as well as reconnect with friends like <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/12/04/conceptshare-grows-and-grows-and-partners-with-corel">Scotty Brooks</a>, <a href="http://notshocking.com/">Corey Denis</a>, <a href="http://www.podcasthotel.com/">Alex Williams</a>, and <a href="http://www.plansphere.com/blog/">Tim Bonnemann</a> as well as hang out with the <a href="http://www.fadetoplay.com/2008/02/25/canadians-heading-to-sxsw/">Vancouver crowd</a> and meet and greet new friends at the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/217376/">South by Northwest part</a>y sponsored by RCS as well as other cool Pacific North West Companies and at our booth. Last but not least, I hope to spend a not insignificant time hanging with <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~n706lg/">Ron</a>, who I have known since I was 6! (Oh and I might take some blurry pictures of the <a href="http://www.sxswbaby.com/index.php/site/more/ride_the_dillos/">dillos</a> too :-) !

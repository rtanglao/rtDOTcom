<p>But of course I am biased (and I didn't see most of the sessions; too busy worrying :-), contributing or moderating!). Like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/02/19/Julie">Tim Bray</a>, I almost cried a couple of times at <a href="http://www.northernvoice.ca/schedule/julie-leung">Julie's session</a> and <a href="http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/onfacblog.htm">Nancy White</a>'s insights rocked my world :-)  at both the Open Space discussion on Friday and the Lightning Talks on Saturday!

<p>More later when I recover from my cold which should be sometime before Wednesday I hope!</p>

<p>On the 40th anniversary of walking on the moon, some reflections: I've always wanted to be an astronaut but I've never wanted to go to grad school or be in the military. I just figured that by 2009, anybody could go with sufficient training and interest without requiring millions of dollars. Boy was I wrong! It's going to happen, I guess it's just a classic case of expecting it too soon. I choose to go to space ! <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/We_choose_to_go_to_the_moon">As well as the moon!</a></p>

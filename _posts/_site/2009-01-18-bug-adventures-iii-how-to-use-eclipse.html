Eclipse is a maze of twisty passages all alike for those not used to it :-) Herewith a quick and dirty guide for those not used to it! More in my <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/bugadventures/Home">Bug Adventures</a> wiki
</p>
<ol>
	<li>How do I use f***ing Eclipse?
	<ol>
		<li>Easy: always make sure the  Dragonfly Perspective is open from Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Other</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>How do I load code from a JAR from other people for a Bug APP that's not on BUGnet?
	<ol>
		<li>&quot;New Bug Project&quot; (one of the funny icons on the top left , the one in the middle)</li>
		<li>Select All Services, and select your Bug, then click Finish</li>
		<li>Right Click-&gt;Import-&gt;General-&gt;Archive File-&gt;Browse-&gt;blah.jar that you received from your friend or fellow developer</li>
		<li>Select &quot;Yes To All&quot; when asked about &quot;Overwrite .project&quot; in folder</li>
		<li>Right Click &quot;Send to Bug</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>There doesn’t seem to be a way to single step through code on the Bug itself. This seems to work no problem on the Virtual Bug but I don’t use simulators, sorry! I used to do this via adb/gdb/xdb/ in the 1990s with HP-UX and other unix variants so there must be a way to do this on the Bug. Pointers appreciated!<br /></p>

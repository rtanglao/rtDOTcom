No matter, this is great news.  Thanks <a href="http://userland.com/">UserLand</a> and <a href="http://www.ludicorp.com/">Ludicorp</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://manila.userland.com/discuss/msgReader$490">Manila: Re: Flickr and Manila weblogs</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>The guys at Flickr did some work with us today to get this running with Manila sites. Murphy willing, there should be a new option in Flickr for adding a Manila weblog to your account, within the next day or two.

Keep an eye on the UserLand Product News site for an announcement.</blockquote>

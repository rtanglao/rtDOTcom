<blockquote><p>Looking at this, I pity the fact that it took us so long to get as far as we've gotten. However, with large players now dancing in the syndication space, I am starting to worry that things are going to get worse before they get better. As a result, I'd like to offer a modest proposal: let's merge all this work and come up with established data sets that are compatible. The use of namespaces for each vendor use is a great idea but shouldn't one first think about what they are trying to accomplish and look at prior art before trying to reinvent the wheel? Let's look at the example of today's announcement from Apple.</p></blockquote>

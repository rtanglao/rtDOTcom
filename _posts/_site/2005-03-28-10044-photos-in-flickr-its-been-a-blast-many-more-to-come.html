I get a lot of flack about not editing my photos since all I do is delete blurry ones (except for the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/mobility/phones/huginmugin/">Hugin And Mugin</a> photos where the blurry photos are an artifact of today's limited cameraphones and slow network). Well, my response is that I am recording my life!

I am not a photographer nor do I plan on becoming one. The photo you dislike or think is superfluous is  valuable context for me and/or has sentimental value. And I am saving it on flickr because it (no longer Blogware, sorry) is the best place to store and retrieve photos on the Internet.

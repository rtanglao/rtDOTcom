<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>I don't often do book reviews (or indeed actual reviews at all), since I can hardly find the time to read anything these days except wads and wads of technical documentation (this is likely to reverse itself in a couple of months when things settle for Summer and I enter my usual reading spree, devouring 200-odd pages a day well into Autumn).

So it took me a long while to find the time (and the relative quiet) needed to read dirtymouse's Fix a troubled Mac, a 196-page PDF e-book that I had the good fortune to be presented with (it is US$15 from Kagi, and you can get a free sample at the main site).</blockquote>

<p>Need to have an empowered, sharing culture for social software like blogs to work.  If your culture is not that way, then blogging won’t work for you (and your organization is probably doomed long term unless it’s the military).  Great report from the <a href="http://www.metagroup.com/">Meta Group</a> that omits <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a> for hosting services (I guess because the marketing from Tucows resellers has not yet hit the radar of consultants) and <a href="http://www.pubsub.com/">PubSub</a> under the Blog/RSS feed search engines  (because it’s new)</p>

<p>From <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/Social_Computing.html?tag=tu.arch.link">Social Computing: Getting Ahead of the Blog - TechUpdate - ZDNet</a> (Via email from <a href="http://www.icentro.com/corporate/about.htm">Randy Fisher</a>):</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>At this point, we would not recommend firm standardization on any single vendor or service. Selections should be considered tactical. We would also not recommend any uncontrolled rollout across the enterprise without employee orientation (e.g., governance factors). Deployments should be prioritized and sequenced based on benefits to specific business objectives, processes, and organizational practices (e.g., provisioning workers with solutions that help them deal with complexity and perpetual change, lifelong learning objectives regarding expertise transfer of work practices in the face of aging workforce trends). Instituted properly, the potential business and workforce benefits of blogs can be significant.

Bottom Line: Innovative decision makers and early adopters will avoid the mistakes of the past (underestimating the impact of the Web) by allocating discretionary funding in 2004 for blog pilots as part of an iterative effort to construct a broader business case for social computing.

Business Impact: Sharing personal knowledge and enabling connections across peer groups are important best practices that improve workplace performance and innovation.</blockquote>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> and I discussed
some emails we have received from Live Journal users. People are under
the impression that public web pages on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Live Journal</a>  are not public to the world, which is not true. And new technologies like <a href="http://www.faganfinder.com/search/rss.shtml">RSS</a>
make it even easier and faster to find out anything on the Internet;
even pages you think nobody will find. The bottom line is: please
password protect or in some way (e.g. Live Journal's <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/site/about.bml">friends only posts</a>) protect pages that you don't wish others who you don't know or trust  to see.</p>

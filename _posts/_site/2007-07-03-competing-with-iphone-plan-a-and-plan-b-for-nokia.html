Nokia doesn't need my advice but I'm going to give it anyway. :-) !
</p>
<p>
Plan A: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the existing phones work right. e.g. fix the <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2007/04/10/shozu-not-ready-for-prime-time/">memory</a> <a href="http://ipadventures.com/?p=1711">problems</a> with ShoZu and the N95 even if this requires throwing hardware at it e.g. by doubling the RAM.</li>
<li>Bundle N95s with ShoZu (a version that allows unlimited size video uploads to YouTube, or blip.tv, the present 4MB limit is silly) and a flickr membership and market the N95 for the groundbreaking and cool device that it is (well that I think it is; I don't have an N95 but other than the usual memory problems and the GPS antenna not being sensitive enough it looks like an awesome device)</li>
</ol>
<p>
Plan B: 
</p>
<ol>
<li> recast S60 around an open source core to make it more reliable and robust</li>
<li>add touch and create a new user interface from the ground up to make the S60 user experience competitive with iPhone.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&lt;/armchair ceo&gt;
</p>
<p>
I am sure Nokia has a response to the iPhone coming soon and I can't wait to see it. Vive la competition! Go Nokia and Apple go!

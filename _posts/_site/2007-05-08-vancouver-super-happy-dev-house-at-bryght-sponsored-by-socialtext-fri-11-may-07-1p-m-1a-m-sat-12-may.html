They came up with the idea of bringing the Bay Area-based Super Happy Dev House to Vancouver.<br /><br />Bryght is providing the venue and BBQ space. Edit the <a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?super_happy_grow_op_dev_house#edit">wiki page</a> to let us know you're coming (also, <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/171753/">upcoming.org</a>).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Come one come all! There will be lots of hacking of all languages and environments and fun including Drupal hacking and making and improving some Drupal websites!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

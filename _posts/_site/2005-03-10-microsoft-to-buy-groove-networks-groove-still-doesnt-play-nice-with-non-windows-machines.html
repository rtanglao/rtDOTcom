<p>Congrats to the <a href="http://www.groove.net/home/index.cfm">Groove</a> folks. I hope this extra money means that Groove will finally start to play nice with the the other platforms like Mac OS X and Linux. It's not a Windows hegemonic world anymore; even <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/news/software/0,39037051,39216543,00.htm">Bill Gates talked about interoperability recently</a>; Groove please clean APIs and interfaces (and horrendously complicated Web Service APIs don't cut it). Stop locking us in the Microsoft trunk, Groove. And yes <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/03/10#When:12:37:51PM">Dave</a>, in the real world, there is no grass roots use of Groove. </p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7147797/">MSNBC - Microsoft to buy Groove Networks</a>.:</p>

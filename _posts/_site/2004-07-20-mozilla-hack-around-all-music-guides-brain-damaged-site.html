<p>Cool hack! Yet another case of the Internet routing around damage.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2004/07/19/2210">Site-specific browser extension: All Music Guide | Holovaty.com</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>I've written an extension for Mozilla Firefox that, when installed, alters the display and functionality of allmusic.com. Specifically, it does the following:

It cleans up the horrible JavaScript-only links sitewide, thus enabling 21st-century browsing techniques such as tabbed browsing and opening links in new windows.

It hides the annoying Flash spinner thing atop each page.

It changes the functionality of the "Read more..." links on band and album detail pages. On the old AMG, band and album pages contained full reviews. Now, they feature only the first few sentences, with a link to "Read more..." on a separate page. The extension changes the functionality of that "Read more..." link so that, instead of taking you to a new page, clicking the link will dynamically load the full band/album review and insert it inline.</blockquote>

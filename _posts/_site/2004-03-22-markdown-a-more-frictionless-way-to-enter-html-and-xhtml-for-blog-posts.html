<p>Markdown sounds like exactly what I am looking for.  Very cool! Must check this out.  Writing HTML without a WYSIWYG editor, using the broken code from Mozilla and IEâ€™s WYSIWG editors and using an HTML text area with a preview mode is for the birds.  Hopefully this will alleviate the pain of doing this</p>

<p>From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Daring Fireball: Markdown</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Thus, &#8220;Markdown&#8221; is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to Markdown&#8217;s formatting syntax. You can try it out, right now, using the online Dingus.

The overriding design goal for Markdown&#8217;s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it&#8217;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown&#8217;s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown&#8217;s syntax is the format of plain text email.</blockquote>

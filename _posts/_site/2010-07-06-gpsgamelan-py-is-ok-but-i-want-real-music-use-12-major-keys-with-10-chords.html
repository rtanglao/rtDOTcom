<p>Continuing to have a great time with Python on the N900. I'll have to post later about how awesome it is to run N900 Python aka PyMaemo scripts &nbsp;from a Terminal.app window on my Mac edited in Aquamacs using ange-ftp (or whatever it's called in the 21st century).</p>
<p>Anyhow came up with <a href="http://gist.github.com/463996">gpsgamelan.py</a> which is a modification of the script from <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/07/02/random-gps-driven-sounds-n900-python">latlongsound.py</a> to play gamelan (indonesian scale) music (using the code from <a href="http://www.pygame.org/project-PygSoundTestTest-1453-2593.html">PyGSoundTestTest_3.py from Matthew Brown</a>, thanks!) based on the jitter from GPS Lat/Long (10 different sounds based on latitude and another 10 different gamelan sounds based on longitude)</p>
<p>Here's what it sounds like (short video from flickr):</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377"><param name="flashvars" value="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=7ab3da72bc&amp;photo_id=4764398655" /> <param name="movie" value="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" /> <param name="bgcolor" value="#000000" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377" bgcolor="#000000" allowfullscreen="true" flashvars="intl_lang=en-us&amp;photo_secret=7ab3da72bc&amp;photo_id=4764398655" /></object></p>
<p>Not so great sound. My next idea is to play more pleasing music</p>
<ul><li>e.g. for each neighbourhood, pick a major key (there are twelve possible major keys in Western music AFAIK)</li><li>based on the latitude, play a major chord (one of 10 possible)</li><li>based on the longitude, play a minor chord (one of 10 possible)</li></ul>
<p>My guess is this will produce more melodic and pleasing sound</p>

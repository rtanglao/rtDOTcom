<p>Our latest venture is <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">Bryght</a>, a hosted <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> service, “the Salesforce.com of community content”.  I am working with <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/boris">Boris</a>, <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/richard">Richard</a>, <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/adrian">Adrian</a> and <a href="http://www.bryght.com/about/the-team/james">James</a> on this one.  Yes, <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/node/1300">we are all Bryght guys</a> :-) !</p>

<p>We have taken Drupal and combined it with web hosting and email to give you a one stop shop for your community content.  No IT required, no muss, no fuss!  Check out <a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/view/52">The lights are on at Bryght</a> for more background on how this started.  And if you know of an individual, organization or company that could use a Bryght site, please <a href="http://www.bryght.com/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Whither <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com/">StreamLine</a> you might ask? StreamLine continues and it will continue to resell <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a> blogs because we still believe that Blogware is the best individual blogging platform.</p>

<p>This time around we're going to follow Helsinki's lead and discussion topic on mobile music and copyright. We're not going to have formal presenters this time around as this is a discussion that we can all contribute to - however, I will ensure a projector is available for anyone packing a quick and informal presentation on the topic. I'm sure the guys from Bryght and ProjectOpus will have a lot to add to this conversation, and would expect to gain some great insight as to the future of digital music.</p></blockquote>

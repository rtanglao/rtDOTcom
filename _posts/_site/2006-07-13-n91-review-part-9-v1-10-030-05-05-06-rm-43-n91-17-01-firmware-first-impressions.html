<p> Now running V1.10.030 05-05-06 RM-43 N91 (17.01) Firmware courtesy of Nokia Vancouver (whose lab is pictured above in a picture by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/smith">Richard Smith</a>). </p>
<p> First impressions: </p>
<ul> <li>Still have out of memory error in Nokia Webkit web browser which makes it almost unusable. Luckily Opera and Opera Mini work well.</li> <li>Haven&#39;t seen the theme reset bug. Hopefully it&#39;s fixed by this version of the firmware</li> <li>ShoZu beta crashed again, aaargh! Other people don&#39;t have this problem with their N91 and ShoZu and other devices running ShoZu and Series 60 v3 like the N80. I am going to reformat the hard drive and do a reset of the device before I make a definitive judgement on this.</li> </ul>

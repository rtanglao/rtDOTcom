Dr. Yedlin is quite a charismatic professor (even though he says he isn’t) and he and Ulrich Rauch and Cyprien Lomas have obviously thought a lot about modeling student teacher interaction using physics models.  Very cool to see the visualization of teacher/student interaction.</p>

<p>Some pushback from the audience: maybe we don’t need technology like wireless and tablet PCs yet, maybe we just need to train professors on simple personal interaction (walking around, engaging students, etc.).</p>

<p>I think that all attempts to ignore technological disruptions are futile.  And modeling is a good idea but it can only go so far.</p>

<p>I agree with Ulrich, teachers have to change their interactions with students to cope with technology.  No matter what you do, the technology is going to happen.</p>

<p>Eric from SUNY Fashion Institute of New York - Accept it, leverage it, deal with it!  Try it out, put it in the curriculum.  Don’t make it ABSTRACT, make it real; relate it to professor’s realities.  Community is not the end result.  It’s the byproduct of community activity.</p>

<p>Pushback from a student-not here to interact with other students or the Internet, here to learn!</p>

<p>Matt - when this interaction between students as well as the learner occurs, then more learning happens.</p>

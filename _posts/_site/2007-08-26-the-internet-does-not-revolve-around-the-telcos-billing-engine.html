<p>The internet is more than billable events! Go Bob go!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>   The Internet has given us abundance by compositing our individual contributions. Yet we are unable to see this abundance. Even worse, we have an entire incumbent telecom industry that is threatened by abundance and seeks refuge in IMS and the fantasy that it can force the world to converge around its billing engine. Once again we&rsquo;re reminded that the Internet is not about telecom; it is about opportunity and community. </blockquote>

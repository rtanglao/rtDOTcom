<p>I am looking for a cheap and cheerful 19" LCD Display to use as a second screen for our Macs (for programming and blogging, etc) at <a href="http://www.bryght.com/">work</a>.
</p>
<p>Does the <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=CADHS1&amp;sku=320-4087&amp;category_id=4009">Dell E193FP 19" LCD Monitor ($CAN 419)</a> work well with Macs? If not, can anybody recommend something in the same price range? Is this a realistic price range for a 19 inch LCD screen that will be used 8-12 hours a day for programming and blogging?</p>

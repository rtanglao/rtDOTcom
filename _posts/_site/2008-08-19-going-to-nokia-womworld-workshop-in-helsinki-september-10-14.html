<p>Details have yet to be finalized, but it looks like I'll be going to a Nokia Mobile workshop (paid for by Nokia, including<a href="http://www.nokia.com/environment/weoffset"> carbon offsets</a>!) September 10-14,2008 being organzied by Nokia's <a href="http://www.nokia.com/environment/weoffset">WOMWorld</a> folks. Sounds like fun. Maybe I can lead a session on <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca/">Mobile Muse</a> and <a href="http://www.sifttool.com/about">SIFTTool</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a portion of their invite:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>It's taking place in September between the 11th and 14th, and will be the first of its kind hosted by Nokia. We're contacting everyone from creative's, designers, video producers to open source software bloggers and mobile tech pioneers. There will be a number of workshops that'll see discussion with participants, and with Nokia guys, about the future of different online arenas and mobile technology. Workshops that we hope you'd like to join in with and make yourself heard.</blockquote>

<p>In the meantime, time to start my travel research. If anybody has been to Helsinki, love to have the following questions answered by a Helsinki person:</p>
<ol><li>Where can I get a pay as you go SIM Card with several gigs (2GB or higher) of data so I can blog, flickr, youtube, et with my Nokia N95-1 while at the workshop?</li><li>Can somebody recommend the best place to rent a bicycle in Helsinki? I am a "born again" bicyclist who's been commuting to work for 16 months 5 days a week and who has taken thousands of photos from an N95 and uploaded to Qik while bicycling. So I'd want to do the same in Helsinki.</li></ol>

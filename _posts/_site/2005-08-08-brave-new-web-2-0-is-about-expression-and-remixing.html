<p>If <a href="http://www.bryght.com/node/204">Web 2.0</a> were a competition, which it is not (it's not about winning it's about expressing yourself, your organization and your company in a conversational 2 way manner to your audience whether that's 1 person or a million), then whoever remixes and expresses themselves best would win! Regardless <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> et al are the best remixing platforms and the best platforms for expression and therefore are 'winning' at the moment.  And Michael Bazeley, I wish I could say I am a web developer, but I am not. I am proud ex-developer. So, I no longer code (well except for my mobile experiments with <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/mobility/phones/huginmugin/">Hugin and Mugin</a>, my friend Simon Lewis's experimental Java Midlet to upload photos to flickr). I spend my time blogging, podcasting, and writing documentation. And it's a blast!</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>For some people, the boundaries between life online and in the ``real word'' increasingly are blurring.
</p><p>Roland Tanglao, a Vancouver Web developer, spends many of his waking hours living ``inside'' the Web. He has uploaded more than 15,000 photos to his two accounts at Yahoo's photo-sharing site, Flickr. He publishes his musings on as many as 10 blogs. And when he stumbles across something on the Web that interests him, he stashes a public bookmark of it online at a service called Del.icio.us (http://del.icio.us) so that others can see it.
</p><p><b>Personal expression</b></p><p>Tanglao, who is the ``chief blogging officer'' for community Web site company Bryght, calls his Flickr stash his ``public backup photo brain.''
</p><p>``It's personal expression,'' Tanglao said. ``You can share what you want with the world. It's changed me, helped me with my business and social network.''
</p><p>The Web's future didn't always look so promising. The dot-com bust stymied innovation, put thousands of programmers and developers out of work, and shriveled funding for new companies. Some pundits even predicted the end of the Web as we knew it.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft crushed Netscape in the ``browser wars'' by bundling its browser with its ubiquitous Windows operating system. Microsoft's dominance stifled innovation.</p><p>Now, though, Web developers have suddenly rediscovered some old technologies and are using them to build vastly more interactive Web sites.

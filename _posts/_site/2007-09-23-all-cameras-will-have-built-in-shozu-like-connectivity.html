<p>In the future, all cameras will have built in ShoZu-like connectivity i.e. the ability to upload photos anywhere anytime using a standard protocol like the Atom publishing protocol with suspend/resume not the bogus connectivity that you get in the Nikon S51C and&nbsp; even the high end Nikon D3 with optional WiFi transmitter. Connectivity is everything and this bogus Nikon S51C and D3 connectivity is of limited use as Robert has found out. </p>

This is a cool little camera that has wifi built in. So, I don&rsquo;t need to hook the camera up to my computer to upload images anymore. </p>...<br /><p>I wish my Canon 5D had Wifi built into it. </p><p>UPDATE: already in my testing I find one thing frustrating: I can&rsquo;t upload images straight to Flickr. I have to upload them to Nikon&rsquo;s site first, then visit my computer and post them from there onto Flickr.</p></blockquote>

After reading this review, I want one for the web browser goodness, Jabber XMPP and Gizmo and GTalk free phone calls over WiFi.

<blockquote>
Summary: The Nokia 770 is the best bridge-device yet between mobility and the web2.0 world. It is a solid go-to device for messaging and presence, as well as having a very capable browser. It can appear a bit sluggish at times, but it is a very flexible device with a lot of untapped potential. Having said that, Nokia has been making steady improvements to the device in the form of software updates.

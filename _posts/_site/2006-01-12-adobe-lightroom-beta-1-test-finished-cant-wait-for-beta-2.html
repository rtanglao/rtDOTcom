<p><a href="http://labs.macromedia.com/technologies/lightroom/">Adobe Lightroom</a> Beta 1 is a a fantastic beta (and a fun introduction to easy to use RAW processing for RAW "virgins" :-) like myself) but I have stopped using it for now for the following reasons:</p>
<ol><li>If you rename the RAW file and import into Lightroom, it uses the old name (reads it from the EXIF perhaps?).</li><li>The light table is not adequate. There is no way to see the original file and your changed file at the same time. Supposedly, pressing control while hovering over the photo should show the original but that doesn't work for me on my 15" Aluminum Powerbook with 1GB RAM and Mac OS X 10.4.4.
</li></ol>
<p>It has great promise. I am relieved that their will be competition for Aperture and I look forward to trying the next beta!</p>

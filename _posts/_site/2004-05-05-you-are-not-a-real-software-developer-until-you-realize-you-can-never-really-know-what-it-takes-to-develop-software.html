<p>So true.  This book sounds like another must read.  The people who think they know everything to know about software development are usually the ones who know nothing.  Too Zen for you? Maybe but it’s absolutely true!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CoderToDeveloper.html">Joel on Software - Mike Gunderloy’s Coder to Developer</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>At every point in the learning cycle, I was completely convinced that I knew everything there was to know about software development.

"Maybe you&#8217;re just an arrogant sod?&#8221; you ask, possibly using an even spicier word than &#8220;sod.&#8221; I beg your pardon: this is my foreword; if you want to be rude write your own damn foreword, tear mine out of the book, and put yours in instead.

There&#8217;s something weird about software development, some mystical quality, that makes all kinds of people think they know how to do it. I&#8217;ve worked at dotcom-type companies full of liberal arts majors with no software experience or training who nevertheless were convinced that they knew how to manage software teams and design user interfaces. This is weird, because nobody thinks they know how to remove a burst appendix, or rebuild a car engine, unless they actually know how to do it, but for some reason there are all these people floating around who think they know everything there is to know about software development.

Anyway, the responsibility is going to fall on your shoulders. You&#8217;re probably going to have to learn how to do software development on your own. If you&#8217;re really lucky, you&#8217;ve had some experience working directly with top notch software developers who can teach you this stuff, but most people don&#8217;t have that opportunity. So I&#8217;m glad to see that Mike Gunderloy has taken upon himself to write the book you hold in your hands. Here you will find a well-written and enjoyable introduction to many of the most important things that you&#8217;re going to need to know as you move from being a person who can write code to being a person who can develop software. Do those sound like the same thing? They&#8217;re not. That&#8217;s roughly the equivalent of going from being a six year old who can crayon some simple words, backwards N&#8217;s and all, to being a successful novelist who writes books that receive rave reviews and sell millions of copies. Being a software developer means you can take a concept, build a team, set up state of the art development processes, design a software product, the right software product, and produce it. Not just any software product: a high quality software product that solves a problem and delights your users. With documentation. A web page. A setup program. Test cases. Norwegian versions. Bokm&#229;l and Nynorsk. Appetizers, dessert, and twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was. (Apologies to Arlo Guthrie.)

And then, one day, finally, perhaps when it&#8217;s too late, you&#8217;ll wake up and say, &#8220;Hmm. Maybe I really don&#8217;t know what it really takes to develop software.&#8221; And on that day only, and not one minute before, but on that day and from that day forward, you will have earned the right to call yourself a software developer. In the meantime, all is not lost: you still have my blessing if you want to eat donuts every hour.</blockquote>

<p> I&#39;ve <a href="/rt/archives/2007/07/03/how-to-fix-shozu">asked for this before from ShoZu</a> but nobody is listening :-) ! In the wrap up meeting today of the mobile rich media research study at SFU at that I was part of the last two months, I expressed my frustration at not being able to fluidly upload videos (sorry but email, FTP or Bluetooth or USB just don&#39;t cut it from a mobile device) to my favourite video sites like I can easily do with photos. I know videos are much much bigger but we have phones that support WiFi. so LazyWeb let&#39;s do it. And I&#39;ll pay! The USB / Bluetooth chain of pain doesn&#39;t work if you take as many videos as I do and if you use a phone like the N93 which takes gorgeous videos that have huge files which easily exceed the limits of today&#39;s mobile uploaders (the biggest I know is Vox which supports video uploads up to 50MB; unfortunately this doesn&#39;t work since the N93 videos can easily be well over 100MB). </p>

Well I went to <a href="/archives/2008/08/06/futureshop-and-other-canadian-retailers-why-dont-you-sell-fabulous-eye-fi-sd-car">FutureShop</a> expecting more of the same old same old and I wasn't disappointed :-). Cleaner lines and better organized stuff but really not much different. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
Here's what I want: a store staffed by people who are all like the &quot;Apple Geniuses&quot; i.e. if I am looking for an iPhone lanyard strap, I could talk to an iPhone expert, if I am looking for a washing machine, I could talk to an washing machine expert. And there would be WiFi and computers so I could do my research in-house. I'd rather queue for somebody who knows what they are talking about than have to deal with three friendly people who don't.
</p>
<p>
I don't really enjoy dealing with staff who obviously don't have any product knowledge or who know less that what a Google Search would reveal. Unfortunately that's the norm for stores like these.
</p>
<p>
However, I am dreaming I know. I'll settle for a staff that isn't afraid to admit they know less than the customer and who are charming and friendly without being overly so.
</p>
<p>
And if anybody knows where I can get a lanyard case for an iPhone 3G, please leave a comment!

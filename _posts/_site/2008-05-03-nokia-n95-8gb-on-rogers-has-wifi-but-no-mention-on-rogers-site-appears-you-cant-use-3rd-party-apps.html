<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://wirelessnorth.ca/2008/05/02/rogers-and-nokia-n95-launch/">Wireless North appears to have the N95 Rogers skinny. It will apparently cost 1.5 cents/kilobyte for 3rd party apps</a> which means 300 MB of pictures uploaded via ShoZu/month = $4500/ month. Aaaaargh, I hope this is *not* true, if it is the r*poff continues!Â </p>
<p>Yay! The N95 8GB North American is available from Rogers starting May 6th. Looks like the <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/A4688742">N95 8GB has WiFi</a> (just paranoid that Rogers would ask Nokia to disable it so I checked the site) according to Nokia.ca! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/2461268821/">No sign</a> of the N95 on the Rogers site (c&#39;mon get with the 21st century Rogers and update your website with new products at the same time you issue a press release!) but I found the following <a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-fun/vision?content10=vision&amp;tab=4">worrisome fine print about the</a> <a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/content/wireless-fun/vision?content10=vision&amp;tab=4">$25/month Rogers Vision dataplan</a> that the N95 will be using as its data plan on the Rogers site:</p>

<p><strong>Does this mean if I use ShoZu to upload 400MB / month over HSDPA that I&#39;ll have to pay 5cents per Kilobyte?</strong> Fingers crossed that this isn&#39;t true (it wouldn&#39;t make sense but carriers don&#39;t make sense (and for what it&#39;s worth i don&#39;t get dinged for using ShoZu over my Fido unlimited data plan). Could somebody please confirm?</p>
<p>From the Press Release blog post from Intomobile <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2008/05/02/nokia-n95-8gb-hits-rogers-wireless-in-canada.html#comment-212790"><cite>Nokia N95 8GB hits Rogers Wireless in Canada</cite></a>:  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like Nokia isn't satisfied with taking the rest of the world by storm as the North American continent rests safely in ignorance. Nokia has launched the Nokia N95 8GB in Canada on Rogers Wireless. As expected, the Canadian Nokia N95 8GB is basically the same a the Nokia N95 8GB NAM (Nokia N95-4), and gives Rogers the pleasure of beating US wireless carrier-giant to the punch in rolling out the N95 8GB in North America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

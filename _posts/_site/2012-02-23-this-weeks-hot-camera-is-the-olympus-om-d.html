<p>I have of course changed my mind. Out with the Fuji X Pro 1, in with the Olympus OM-D because it's cheaper, it has built-in Eye Fi support so my photos can get auto-uploaded and auto-geotagged, takes the awesome Micro Four Thirds lenses (45mm prime! 20mm prime!Need I say more&nbsp; :-) ? )&nbsp; and is weather sealed! Anyways really enjoying my Fuji X10 for now! I will think about the OM-D in July around my birthday!</p>

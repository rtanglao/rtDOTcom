The key idea is that you can see the presence of your friends and then participate in multi-threaded public conversations as well as (I hope) in the future private messages as well as voice over ip calls and heck even SMS to those people who don&#39;t have fancy phones. All of this is done over IP (so it obviously requires a world of affordable unlimited mobile internet); no need to pay the ridiculous phone call, IMS, or SMS &quot;tax&quot; er charge :-) and it&#39;s better because of the presence information! Imagine if this was combined with something like <a href="http://www.iotum.com/platform.php">Iotum&#39;s Relevance engine</a>.... hmmmm. This will happen; just not as fast as early adopters like myself would like. </p>

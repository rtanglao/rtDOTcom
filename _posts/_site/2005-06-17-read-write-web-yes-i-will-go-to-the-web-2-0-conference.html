<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Ok, this morning's post was silly. Now here's a serious one. I will go to San Francisco this October, for two reasons. Firstly to attend the Web 2.0 Conference (why should I miss out on all the fun!). Secondly to get a job in America, so my family and I can live there.

<p>From <a href="http://mhgoldberg.com/blog/2008/04/iphone-coming-to-rogers.html"><cite>Telecom Trends: iPhone coming to Rogers</cite></a>:  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement released this morning about the iPhone, Rogers has announced that it has reached an agreement with Apple to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Ted Rogers is quoted in the very brief statement, saying:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to announce that we have a deal with Apple to bring the iPhone to Canada later this year. We can't tell you any more about it right now, but stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As I wrote recently, there appears to be imminent plans to release an upgrade to the current iPhone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

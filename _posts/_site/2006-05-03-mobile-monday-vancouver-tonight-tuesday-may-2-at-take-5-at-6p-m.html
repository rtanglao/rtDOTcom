Completely breaking with tradition we’re going to hold Mobile Monday on a Tuesday next month. While there aren’t going to be any formal presentations or demos, you can count on some great conversation about mobile technology, lifestyle and general industry buzz. Remember to bring business cards for any networking opportunities.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
We’d also like to take a few minutes of the meeting to discuss the future of Mobile Monday Vancouver as well as solicit any and all suggestions and ideas.

<blockquote>
So, without further rambling on my part - the next Mobile Monday Vancouver meeting will take place at the Take 5 Cafe at Granville and Hastings on TUESDAY May 2nd, 2006 at 6:00 - 8:00pm.

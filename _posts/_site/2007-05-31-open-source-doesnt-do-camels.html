<p>Something for&nbsp; open source doubters to think about!</p>
<p>From&nbsp; <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2007/05/25/nicholas-carr-on-opensource/">Nicholas Carr on opensourc</a>e talking about <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/press/article/07204?gko=b7f91-1876-26241227">The Ignorance of Crowds</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We shouldn&rsquo;t dismiss lightly the propensity for opensource to innovate, to augment innovation and to accelerate innovation, for the following reasons:</p><blockquote><p><em>The diversity inherent in the crowd creates long-tail effects, and this causes the bazaar to come up with stuff that the cathedral wouldn&rsquo;t consider; in cases where the cathedral does consider the innovation, the bazaar is often faster and cheaper; and finally, while tight coordination by central authority seems a worthwhile thing, we should not forget the number of camels designed by committees.</em></p></blockquote><p><em><strong>In fact that&rsquo;s one of the key stanchions of opensource communities. They don&rsquo;t do camels.&nbsp;</strong></em></p></blockquote>

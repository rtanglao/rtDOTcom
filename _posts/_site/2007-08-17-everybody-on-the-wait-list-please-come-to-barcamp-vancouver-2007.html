Important Update Thursday, August 16th 2007
<br />
<br />At the last BarCamp Vancouver organizers meeting, we counted our budget, checked Workspace's fire regulations, mixed our metaphors, crossed our ayes and dotted our teas.
<br />
<br />The good news is that we can fit everyone for Saturday - including people who were on the waiting list as of 17:00 PDT on Thursday, August 16th.
<br />
<br />If Workspace gets too full, then we can borrow some space from Bryght (who has their office right next to Workspace)
<br />
<br />Note that we still only have 120 T-shirts and might run out of food (in which case, we will run out to get more.)

I am posting this here because I couldn't successfully leave a comment to <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/2004/11/07#a1967">the post over on BloggerCon.org</a>.

<p>
First of all thank-you for BloggerCon to the organizers and the participants.  This is my kind of conference.
</p>
<p>
I have the following "thinking out loud" ideas for future BCs:
</p>
<p>
i) have a technographer/live blogger blog the session live and have this projected up on the screen   (I volunteer to do this for one session at the next one)
<br />ii) have a formal IRC person monitor the IRC chat and inform the DL of the state of the IRC periodically (again I volunteer to do this for one session at the next one and again this should be up on the big screen for all to see)
<br />iii) try a non theatre-style room, i.e. one with a huge round table or several round tables (inspired by Ed Cone's suggestion at the closing session).

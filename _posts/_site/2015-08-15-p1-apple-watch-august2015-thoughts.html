  <li>I’ve stopped using the camera remote control because it’s a gimmick!</li>
  <li>Siri to set alarms and timers is super helpful and useful all the time.</li>
  <li>Getting text messages on the watch means I no longer miss text messages.</li>
  <li>It’s surprising how often you check the time!</li>
  <li>I still don’t understand the digital crown versus the button difference!</li>
  <li>It’s surprising how many little bugs there are! I don’t recall the iPhone 2G having this many small fit and finish bugs but I bet I am mis-remembering!</li>
  <li>Having said that while I was on vacation I left my Apple watch at  home and didn’t miss it!</li>
  <li>I think it will be useful on vacation when apps appear.</li>

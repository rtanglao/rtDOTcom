<p>In spite of my whingeing about the not very useful <a href="/archives/2008/01/21/n81-8gb-review-part-3-navi-wheel-doesnt-work-well">navi wheel</a> and the <a href="/archives/2008/01/21/n81-8gb-review-part-2-multimedia-key-not-intuitive">multimedia key</a>, I am quite happy using the N81 8GB as a walkman for some music while <a href="http://urbanvancouver.com/node/5479">cycling to and from work</a>. The speakers are loud even though they are muffled through my shirt pocket (buttoned for safety) as I cycle in.</p>

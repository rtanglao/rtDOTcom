As I look across the landscape of online content, I have observed some things that clearly work:
<br />1. Users don't care where the information comes from. They just want to know what is out there. So failing to include the free Web with your paid service is a big mistake.
<br />
<br />2. Failing to provide premium for pay information on your free search is just as big a mistake. If the answer to a question relates to health or wealth, people will pay.
<br />
<br />3. You have to be very clear and honest with users about what is free and what is paid. Don't try to charge for content that is free elsewhere.

<p> OK,  the N80i is not supported. I hope the N93 is supported! Sorry about those having comment problems; I need to upgrade to Drupal 5 to fix it.  Soon! </p>

<blockquote> You won&#39;t need to wake the GPS antenna, ShoZu will do this when necessary so you don&#39;t need to do any more than pair the device. What you will need, however, is a very strong GPS signal. ShoZu will wait until you have signal from 5 or more satellites before tagging your images because any less than this can produce inaccurate results. You&#39;ll notice sometimes on weak signal that your navigation software will jitter for a moment, if we tagged images at this time they would be way off. So please make sure you don&#39;t just have signal, but you have a very strong signal. We&#39;ve done this because we figure geotagging is no use unless it&#39;s 100% accurate all the time! <br /> <br />By the way Roland, the N80i is not supported as yet and there are a lot of memory issues on this phone so just be weary of this also. Tried to post a reply on your blog but it had an internal server error and now I&#39;m listed as a spammer and it won&#39;t let me post! Now&#39;s the time I finally get to ask you for support :-D </blockquote>

<p> This is the final post of my <a href="/rt/tags/n91-review">N91 Review series</a>.  One sentence summary: The N91 is an awesome music phone  if you are a power user who&#39;s not in love with Smart Playlists and if you are not looking for a <a href="/rt/archives/2006/11/17/blogaphone-i-want-it-n95-plus-keyboard">blogaphone</a>. </p>

<ol> <li><a href="/rt/archives/2006/11/09/n91-review-part-17-great-music-phone-if-you-are-a-power-user">Great iPod phone if you can live without iTunes Smart playlists</a> OR you don&#39;t mind drag and drop</li> <li><a href="/rt/archives/2006/10/11/n91-review-part-13-love-the-keyboard-lock-switch-and-the-standard-headphone-jacks">Great Standard hardware ports</a> - Down with the pop port. Up with headphone jacks and USB jacks!</li> <li>WiFi rocks - I will never pay my own money for a phone without WiFi. The value of having WiFi cannot be underestimated if you live and work in a sea of WiFi which is almost everywhere in Vancouver and elsewhere that I frequent.</li> <li><a href="/rt/archives/2006/10/11/n91-review-part-14-shozu-still-rocks-but-is-not-stable-on-my-n91">ShoZu over WiFi rocks</a></li> </ol>
<p> DISLIKES: </p>
<ol> <li><a href="/rt/archives/2006/11/02/n91-review-part-16-volume-keys-spontaneously-stopped-working-today">Symbian Series 60 v3 is not stable enough</a></li> <li><a href="/rt/archives/2006/10/11/n91-review-part-14-shozu-still-rocks-but-is-not-stable-on-my-n91">ShoZu on S60 is not stable enough</a> (not to diss Cognima or Symbian, it&#39;s just the way it is, hopefully fixed in firmware upgrades and ShoZu upgrades) - in my opinion ShoZu working stably especially with WiFi phones  should be used to test S60 and if it&#39;s not stable enough that S60 v3 phone should not ship. But I am biased :-) !</li> </ol>

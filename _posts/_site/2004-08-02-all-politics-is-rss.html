<p>Preach it, <a href="http://www.rklau.com/tins/">Rick</a>!  Too bad the candidates that I vote for in Canada don’t have blogs and RSS feeds.  Working on it!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.rklau.com/tins/archives/2004/08/02/all_politics_is_local_all_politics_is_rss.php">tins ::: Rick Klau’s weblog: All politics is local, all politics is RSS</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>That&#8217;s when it hit me: every Democratic candidate I&#8217;ll vote for in November has an RSS feed. Sure, we know that John Kerry has a blog, which has its own RSS feed. And Barack Obama, who&#8217;s got a blog. Then there&#8217;s Gloria Andersen, running for US Congress, who has a LiveJournal diary. Rob Freedman, running for Clerk of the Circuit Court, has an RSS feed for the site and he maintains a blog at the site (with its own feed) as well. Mike Kisler is running for County Coroner, whose site publishes an RSS feed for all content. Hiram Wurf is running for County Board, and uses his blog to talk directly to potential voters (great article about how blogs can change the nature of local races is here). There are other candidates nearby &#8212; Christine Cegelis is running for Congress, who maintains her site in MT, including some non-blog portions &#8212; who also have feeds.</blockquote>

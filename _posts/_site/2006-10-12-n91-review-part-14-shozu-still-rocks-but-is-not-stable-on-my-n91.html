<a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal">ShoZu</a> rocks! With the N91 and WiFi, you can set it up so that if you live in a "sea of WiFi" (i.e. spend most of your time at places with WiFi like I do), that it will automatically upload photos and videos over WiFi to flickr or wherever you want. No <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/03/05/fido-mobile-data-is-a-ripoff-if-you-arent-grandfathered-with-an-unlimited-dataplan">r*poff GPRS or 3G data plan</a> needed.

Shozu is great on the N91 .... when it works. Unfortunately even though I am using the latest firmware on the N91 and the latest version of ShoZu, reformatted the Hard Drive,  crossed my 't's and dotted my 'i's and tried throwing salt over my left shoulder :-( ShoZu starts freezing the phone after 50 or so photos.

I don't think my phone is a lemon :( Everything else works! My unfortunate reality is that adding ShoZu to the mix, destabilizes my N91. Lifeblog (even though I hate its 10 photos at a time limitation) works so it's not the WiFi stack (or so it would appear).

I blame ShoZu's tight integration with the operating system. My guess is that ShoZu has some sort of event handler or interrupt or some such operating system integration which is buggy or problematic in Symbian Series 60 v3. I figure it's a V3 issue since I uploaded over GPRS thousands of photos with ShoZu and the <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=35034347371%40N01&amp;q=shozu+7610&amp;m=tags">7610</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=35034347371%40N01&amp;q=shozu+n70&amp;m=tags">N70</a> (both of which are v2 phones) without this instability.

Lazyweb HELP! I'll buy whoever fixes my problem lunch. Until then, I'll keep doing the ShoZu reset dance every 50 or so photos.

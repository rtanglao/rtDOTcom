<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/en-us/72157625382059569/#reply">5 months later and Nokia N8 video still doesn't work on flickr</a>. Interestingly, N8 video works fine on YouTube. I think this is symptomatic of both the decline and irrelevance of both flickr and Nokia that they can't get video working with Nokia's flagship phone.</p>
<p>Oh well ! Onwards! I have 200 N8 videos that I'd like to batch re-encode so that they *do* work on flickr. what's the best way to do this on Mac OS X. <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFMpeg</a>?</p>
<p>p.s. Nokia N8 and flickr: I still love you both :-) Luckily I can handle this video issue; I couldn't handle it if there was a similar issue with photos!</p>

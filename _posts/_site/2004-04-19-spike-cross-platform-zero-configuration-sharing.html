<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>When you share a Spike clipboard, you see a clipping as soon as it is copied on the source machine. You can immediately drag that clipping into your own document on your own machine, and save valuable time.

Spike is easy to use. Spike uses native copy and paste features to create visual clipboards containing thumbnail images of each clipping. The images are scalable, so you can identify the text or image you&#8217;re looking for without opening a file. And you can create multiple clipboards to organize the clippings so that they are easy to find.Spike is secure. All data is encrypted automatically, and you can password-protect access to your clipboard.

Spike requires no configuration. Just start Spike up and it finds all of the other shared Spike clipboards on your network. Simply click on a remote clipboard and visually inspect the clippings. Double click on a clipping to load it, then go to your favorite application and paste. Or drag the clipping from Spike to your application. Collaboration has never been this easy!</blockquote>

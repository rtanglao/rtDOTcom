<p>It starts with two.  Join us won’t you? You have nothing to lose except subsidizing the Canadian music business.  A business where most artists make very little money and the fatcats in the middle make far too much.</p>

<p>Musicians will be better off if you buy tickets to their concerts, buy T-shirts and their CDs direct from the artists at their gigs rather than through record stores (I support <a href="http://www.zulurecords.com/i">Zulu</a> and other independent record stores of their ilk; I don’t suppport the chain record stores and other music business lackeys) and other non-value added channels.</p>

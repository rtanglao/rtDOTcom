<p>Read the whole thing to learn about how kids look at technology. Talk about thinking differently!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://blog.redherring.com/MT/archives/main/000198.html#more">Red Herring Blog: Childrenâ€™s tribe</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Phones are cellular, and wires are stupid. I can't get my two-year-old to talk on a landline, and I can't keep him away from my cell phone. Partly it's because of the superior design values of telephones, but it's also because they do cooler stuff (No. 2 above). His big sister was three before she really understood that some phones had cords. Her response: "That's dumb, Daddy."

Note to telcos: prepare exit strategy from landline business.

So young kids interact differently with technologies than even their older brothers and sisters. But they also think differently about media.</blockquote>

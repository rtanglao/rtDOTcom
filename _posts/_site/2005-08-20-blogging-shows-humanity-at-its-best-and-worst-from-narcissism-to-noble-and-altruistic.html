<blockquote><p>"Electricity of participation" indeed.  So, we are back to the birds and the bees, not this time to learn how our species propagates, but to learn how birds, bees, wolves . . . and humans like to be part of communities and contribute to them.  I find it truly fascinating that far from being, as I thought, a mere exercise in "narcissism", blogging ends up being a primal, noble - even altruistic -- experience, showing humanity at its very best.</p></blockquote>

<p> I finished <a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming in Code</a> several weeks ago. Amazing, must-read  book for both people in the software industry and those not. I finally have a book that I can hand to my parents and other non software people and say: &quot;Read this and you will finally be able to understand the crazy business I am in&quot;. Highly Recommended! I will now read everything Scott Rosenberg writes because I am a big fan of his insightful but easy to read prose! </p>
<p> Also recommended: <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/ullman_machine.html">Ellen Ullman&#39;s Close to the Machine</a> and Tracy Kidder&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine">The Soul of A New Machine</a>. Classics but not essential for those not in the biz. </p>

<p>I like my friend <a href="http://blog.robinyap.com">Robin</a>'s take and the replacement of 'Constantly' with Consistently. I need to follow my own advice and blog more consistently!</p>
<p>FROM <a href="http://blog.robinyap.com/2007/08/im_walking_among_giants.html">I'm walking among giants... ! Consistent blogger needed here. (Yap 3.0)</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>My friend, David Peralty, recently posted the pro's and con's of being a problogger. In interviewing bloggers, execs and colleagues for a chapter I was writing on Leveraging Corporate Blogging for Training for a book sponsored by Simon Fraser, I wanted to refer to Bryght's Chief Blogger, Roland Tanglao's comment on the need for creating compelling content constantly. Two points are key from this quote: Compelling Content and Constant (or to me, that would be Consistent; a bit of a nuance change there).</blockquote>

<p>I still think this recipe is too complicated. If you want something simpler just use<a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/"> WireTap Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/freebies/">LineIn</a>. No need for the complicated <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijackpro/">Audio Hijack Pro</a> setup that Glenn describes. Audio Hijack Pro is awesome but complicated to use.</p>

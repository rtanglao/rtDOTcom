It doesn't appear to. My observations (check out my <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/08/11/why-i-have-stopped-using-shozu-sports-tracker-and-n82-and-use-n900-pixelpipe-run">previous post on Pixelpipe with the N900</a>):</p>
<ol><li>PixelPipe doesn't appear to support flickr's privacy level of "family". It does support totally private and totaly public which map to the equivalent in flickr but that's not what I want.</li><li>Luckily the built-in&nbsp; N900 Share Online does support family on flickr. So that's what I am using.</li><li>My theory: PixelPipe on Symbian and other operating systems supports Flickr's "family. Just didn't bother to implement it on N900</li><li>With the number of people who use the N900 being low, I can see why such a decision would have been made. So no harsh feelings Pixelpipe :-)</li></ol>

<p>Excellent. Must see <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/workshops/SCS2005/speakers/Stone.aspx">Linda Stone</a> speak about this in person someday!

<p>From <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/06/supernova_2005_2.html">O'Reilly Radar &gt; Supernova 2005: Attention</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Attention captured by marketing messages and leaders who give us a sense of trust, belonging in a meaningful way. Now we long for a quality of life that comes in meaningful connections to friends, colleagues, family that we experience with full-focus attention on relationships, etc.
</p>
<p>The next aphrodisiac is committed full-attention focus. In this new area, experiencing this engaged attention is to feel alive. Trusted filters, trusted protectors, trusted concierge, human or technical, removing distractions and managing boundaries, filtering signal from noise, enabling meaningful connections, that make us feel secure, are the opportunity for the next generation. Opportunity will be the tools and technologies to take our power back.</p></blockquote>

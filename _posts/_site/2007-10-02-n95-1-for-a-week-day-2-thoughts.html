<ol>   <li>Seems faster shot to shot than the N93</li>    <li>Photos seem more vivid (more sharpening)</li>    <li>EDGE s*cks but just like on the N73 less s*cky than GPRS</li>    <li>Video seems just as good as the N93</li>    <li>Got my first out of memory errors from the browser (at this point I only have ShoZu installed and a few videos and a few photos :-) )</li>    <li>ShoZu owes me lots of beer :-P for the number of people I have taught how to configure ShoZu over WiFi and how to config ShoZu in general (it&#39;s not that bad but it could be improved, the flickr authorize screen could be more obvious and that &quot;chess piece&quot; capcha has to go)</li>    <li>Just like <a href="/rt/archives/2007/02/27/n80i-shozu-tom-tom-gps-works-50-of-the-time-n80i-s60-shozu-or-tom-tom-bug">using a Tom Tom GPS puck with a N93 and N80</a>, the GPS lock is problematic and works erratically</li> </ol>

<p>Iâ€™m confident that the smart people at Google will do the smart thing and put RSS in Gmail.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><strong>It was interesting to me that you did finally hit on the word conversation. It seems to me that there's a synergy between the elements of the conversation in the RSS space and what you're doing in the e-mail space.</strong>

I think that's very true.  Part of the things we've seen why blogs and RSS feeds are such a success is that you can actually read it&#8212;you don't have to stop, click back and forth, collect bits and pieces here and there&#8212;but it is all presented to you as one.

And that's what we've aimed for in the conversations as well, because I don't want to have to hunt and peck around to get the different pieces of the same conversation. I want to be able to see it all at once.</blockquote>

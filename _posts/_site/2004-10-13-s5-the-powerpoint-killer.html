Amazing hack! Yet another reason not to use Powerpoint.

Thanks to the efforts of many people, the slide show system I&#8217;ve been working on is just about ready for prime time. Thus, I hereby dub it S5 and place it into Final Candidate status, complete with documentation of the markup format and a map of the files that are used for an S5 presentation.
<br />
<br />There is one thing I&#8217;ve found that needs to be addressed before exiting the FC stage, and that&#8217;s the handling of slide titles that contain markup. If you look at the slide show S5: An Introduction, the navigation menu entry for the title slide is &#8221; 0: Snull: An Introduction". It should be &#8221; 0: S5: An Introduction". I know this has something to do with walking the DOM tree and collecting the appropriate bits, but I&#8217;ve yet to figure out how to do that efficiently. Assistance, as always, is appreciated.

<p>I like the town hall analogy for bulletin boards.  Not sure I like the blogs are public diaries analogy (IMHO blogs, in addition to being great diaries, are also great marketing tools, support tools, etc).  My favourite definitions are still “<a href="http://interactiveu.berkeley.edu:8000/PatD/discuss/msgReader$382">blogs are digital paper</a>” and “<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/whatMakesAWeblogAWeblog">blogs are the unedited voice of a person</a>”.</p>

<blockquote>I really like: "blogs are diaries that can be read by the public, while bulletin boards are town hall meetings in which the public can all discuss issues equally." 

I think there's also a lot of insight in the ways that these two things can be used in conjunction with one another.&#160;&#160;The town hall quality of message boards can play off of the informational/journal quality of weblogs. </blockquote>

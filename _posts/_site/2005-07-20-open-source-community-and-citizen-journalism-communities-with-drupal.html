<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>In the past year, <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> has gone from a secret weapon used by those "in the know" to powering many of today's leading online community sites. E.g. <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/">Spread Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.planetcocoon.com/">Planet Cocoon</a>, <a href="http://baitcar.com/">BaitCar</a>, <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/">Urban Vancouver</a>, <a href="http://www.phillyfuture.org/">Philly Future</a>, <a href="http://www.blufftontoday.com/">BlufftonToday</a>, etc. At this BOF, learn from the Drupal community and Drupal entities like <a href="http://bryght.com/">Bryght</a> and <a href="http://civicspacelabs.org/home/">Civic Space</a> about the Drupal best practices for creating online community. All are welcome including Drupal users and developers and newbies. We can all learn from each other.

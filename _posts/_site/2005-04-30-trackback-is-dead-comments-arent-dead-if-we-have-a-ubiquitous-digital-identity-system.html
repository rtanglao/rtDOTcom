<p>Amen! <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/02/06/trackback_is_dead_use_pubsub">Trackback is indeed dead as I blogged on February 6, 2005</a>. Use PubSub, Feedster, Technorati, etc. instead. Comments are not dead. All we need is lightweight, usable, ubiquitous  digital identity (e.g. <a href="http://sxip.com/">sxip</a>) integrated into blogs and comment systems and comments can undergo a revival.</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>I think it's time we faced the fact that Trackback is dead. We should state up front - the aspirations behind Trackback were admirable. We should reassert that we understand that there is a very real need to find mechanisms to knit together the world of webloggers and to allow conversations across multiple weblogs to operate effectively. We must recognise that Trackback was one of the first and most important attempts to work in that area. But Nevertheless, we have to face the fact - Trackback is dead.</p></blockquote>

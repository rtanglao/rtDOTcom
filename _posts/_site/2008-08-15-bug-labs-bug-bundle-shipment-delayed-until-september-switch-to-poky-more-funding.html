<p>My <a href="http://buglabs.net/products">Bug Bundle</a> has been <a href="http://bugblogger.com/a-long-overdue-productstatus-update-159/">delayed until September</a>. Bug is switching to <a href="http://bugblogger.com/bug-adopts-poky-linux-155/">Poky Linux</a> and they closed <a href="http://bugblogger.com/weve-raised-a-third-round-of-funding-185/">a 3rd round of funding</a>.  I am still <a href="/archives/2008/04/14/grassroots-open-mobile-web-at-open-web-vancouver-2008">very enthusiastic</a> about The Bug but it’s hard to be an enthusiast when you are itching to experiment and shipment is delayed by 3 months. And as I have said before I don’t really like simulators. Oh well, perhaps I’ll activate one of my dormant iPhone application ideas!</p>

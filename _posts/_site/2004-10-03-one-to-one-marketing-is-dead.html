Last night, during our discussions, in response to a question of, "Why not use email to communicate to customers when there is a problem?" vs a blog, Guillaume kept muttering about blogs: "It's one-to-many, not one-to-one."
<br />
<br />And he is so right. One-to-one marketing is a false trail for marketing. It is, in fact, built on a base of lies, and the consumer knows it. Therefore, it cannot work (explanation for this claim in a minute). Blogging, on the other hand, is one-to-many. It uses the blog as a lever, an amplifier, enabling one voice to reach many, yet in a personal manner. Done well, blogs create credibility, trust. One-to-one marketing is never personal, and it never creates trust.

<p>I am not a big fan of keyboards on mobile devices (nor mobile email, i get enough email (hundreds/day like everybody else!), if you want to reach me, SMS me or call me) but if the keyboard is easy to use and doesn't make the N800 successor too thick (I like the N800 form factor), I might actually like it!</p>

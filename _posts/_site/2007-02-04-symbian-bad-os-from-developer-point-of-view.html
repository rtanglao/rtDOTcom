<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://www.ringnokia.com/2007/02/is_symbian_a_ba.html">I don&#39;t really expect Nokia to respond</a>. &quot;Can&#39;t wait for Nokia&#39;s response to this!&quot; was a crude attempt at humour that obviously failed.</p>
<p> Hmmm. If it&#39;s really this bad (I am unencumbered by technical knowledge :-) when it comes to Symbian other than the user level knowledge that S60 on the mobile phones I get for free from Nokia crashes and hangs a lot), I&#39;d suggest to Nokia to &quot;pull a Mac OS X&quot; and move to another OS or acquire one or develop one.  Can&#39;t wait for Nokia&#39;s response to this! </p>

<blockquote> One developer writes, &ldquo;In most regards, Symbian&#39;s reputation as a modern, robust, stable and advanced OS for smartphones is not well deserved. Sure, Symbian works, it has a very long feature list, and it&#39;s probably even the best smartphone OS available today.  But it&#39;s mostly because the competition is pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br />&ldquo;I have a done several Symbian projects and have a thorough knowledge and low-level understanding of Symbian. And I just hate it. It&#39;s a very bad and uninspiring OS even from a programmers point of view.&rdquo; </blockquote>

<p>Fotonotes rocks! Glad to see that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is using it rather than re-inventing the wheel. I hope other apps start using it!
From <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/05/10/flickr_notes_visually_annotate_your_photos#comment112">Stewartâ€™s comment on Flickr Notes - visually annotate your  photos</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Thanks Roland! Hopefully it will be everywhere: we're committed to helping to develop and supporting a standard for annotation, based on Greg Elin's <a href="http://fotonotes.net">Fotonotes</a> stuff. Once there is something to be compatible with, Flickr will be 100% 'Fotonotes R/W' (read/write) compatible.</blockquote>

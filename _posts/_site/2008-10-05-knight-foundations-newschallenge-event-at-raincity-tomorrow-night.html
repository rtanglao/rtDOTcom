Speaking of &quot;<a href="/tags/newspaper-2-0">Newspaper 2.0&quot;</a> and &quot;Media 2.0&quot; (whatever those terms mean :-) !), my friend <a href="/tags/newspaper-2-0">Susan Mernit</a> who I met way back in Boston at BloggerCon I in 2004 (was it 2004? <strong>update</strong> it was <strong>late 2003</strong>! I remember great discussion with Susan and <a href="http://fuzzyblog.wordpress.com/">Scott Johnson</a> and others over dinner one night, where is Scott a now? ) and who besides having her own startup, <a href="http://peoplessoftware.com/">People's Software Company</a>, with another friend, <a href="http://www.cadence90.com/wp/">Lisa Williams</a>, is also a program evangelist and manager of Knight News Challenge at the Knight Foundation which is giving away money to web media related projects. See you all tomorrow at 7p.m. at Raincity at the <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=73319110202">Vancouver NewsChallenge event</a>! Bring your projects, questions and enthusiasm!

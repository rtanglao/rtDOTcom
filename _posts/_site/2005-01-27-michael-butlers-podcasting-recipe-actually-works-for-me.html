<p>Thank-you <a href="http://www.americanheartbreak.com/movabletype/">Michael</a>! Now to do a real podcast using Michael's recipe! If it works, I am definitely buying <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/">WireTap Pro</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.americanheartbreak.com/movabletype/archives/000160.html#comments">The Rock and Roll Geek Show: My Podcasting Recipe</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>Directions:<br />
<p>1. Open Line in. set the sound input source to line in. (if you are using an iMic then set it to iMic)<br />
2. Open WireTap. Hit record and any sound that is coming out of your computer will be recorded. I play my music on iTunes and have assorted sound clips on Quicktime. Wiretap records them all.<br />
3. When you are finished recording, a new quicktime movie will pop up on your screen. Save it as whatever name you want.<br />
4. If you need to do any editing of the file, then open it up in Audacity or Peak and do your editing. When you are done, save the file.<br />
5. Drag the file into iTunes. Set the iTunes prefs to whatever bitrate you want to convert the file to. (I use 64k, 44.1 stereo<br />
6. Convert the file to mp3. ( I realize this step can be skipped by converting it in Audacity but this is the way I do it)<br />
7. Add any id tags that you need. (important to do if you want people to know what they are listening to.
</p>
<p>That is it!</p>

<p>Of course you can get more fancy and use a mixer, etc. but this is a good basic start and is exactly how I did my podcasts from the road.

<p>Just had a great time collaboratively editing over the internet a document using <a href="://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>. And it was great until we started using nested ordered lists. Of why oh why can't we have WYSIWYG editors in 2005 that can cope with nested lists properly without b*rking the HTML? Guess we really need a robust collaborative Web Outliner (I know <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc</a> et al are working on it!) Please can I have it yesterday? </p>

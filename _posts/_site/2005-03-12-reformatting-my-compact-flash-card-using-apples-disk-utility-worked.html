<p><a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/03/08/cant_reformat_my_lexar_1gb_40x_compact_flash_card_error_e50">My problem reformatting my 1GB 40x Compact Flash card</a> was fixed by reformatting it using Apple's Disk Utility (select FAT32/Windows not Apple's disk format). Reformatting the card in my Canon S400 or <a href="http://kriskrug.com/">Kris</a>'s (thanks for the help Kris) Canon 20D didn't do the trick.</p>

<p>The pre iPhone 4 camera is not as great as the Nokia cameraphones have been (the iPhone 4 finally has a decent camera that actually is better than most Nokia cameraphones) but because it is easy to use and to develop for there are many apps that make it fun e.g. hipstamatic. I am glad that the N900 finally has some decent apps like FCamera, low-light assistant and hdr capture that are powered by the research project <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/07/21/fcam-unleashed-for-the-nokia-n900/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NokiaConversations-Posts+%28Nokia+Conversations+-+Posts%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">FCam</a>. Can't wait to try these. Expect lots of fun and weird pictures from these apps in my flickr stream soon.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I don't believe people and companies are naturally opposed, but rather that the kinds of corporate creatures that dominated and oppressed their ways through the Industrial Age were advantaged by a lack of power among individuals on the demand sides of marketplaces, and a producer/consumer asymmetry that no longer exists - not now that consumers can produce as well, which is one very significant aspect of open source: the demand side supplying itself.</p></blockquote>

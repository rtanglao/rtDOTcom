<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>I think somebody needs to stand up and start waving a flag that&#8217;s labeled &#8220;WS-Simplification&#8221; or &#8220;Real Web Services&#8221; or something, that&#8217;s all about building applications with what&#8217;s here today and what works today: XML, HTTP, URIs, SOAP, WSDL, and that&#8217;s about it.

People who need solutions today are building successfully today with that toolkit and I know because I&#8217;ve seen them. Save the future for the future and don&#8217;t bet on research projects, leaky abstractions, or the inventiveness of committees.

I haven&#8217;t figured out yet how to organize making that happen.</blockquote>

<p> Got children? Gonna have children? Got nephews and nieces? Got Multimedia of the kids and want to share with others who may not  be Social Media saavy? Then come to my session at BarCamp Vancouver 2007 on Saturday and let&#39;s figure out together ways to improve <a href="http://kinzin.com/">Kinzin</a> and other sites designed for sharing stuff with family. And if you have thoughts in advance <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007">add them to the wiki</a> please! </p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>In an emergency, think: Cheap. Simple. Ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Perhaps cellphone SMS messages that go directly to a central wiki that is hosted by an large easy-to-remember-even-if-I-never-imagined-I-would-be-in-a-major-disaster organization whether it is Red Cross or Google?</p>

<p>What would have been helpful in the tsunami was a central phone number everyone has memorized to call in case of emergencies. I don't know if they have 911 in other countries. After the tsunami, people (those on boats, and high ground) still had cellphones. But no one knew who to call.</p>

<p>We managed to get to high ground eventually and find a resort with a working television set. Yet, there was absolutely no usable information for survivors. Ah, now I know a 8.9 earthquake hit. More photos of devastation. Hmm, tsunami. That explains the wall of water we frantically ran from. But it's all retrospective. And of little practical use.
</p>
<p>We wanted to know if another wave was coming. Were there aftershocks? Which hospitals weren't damaged - i.e. do attempt to flag a boat to Krabi or Phuket hospital? Will we need money for medical care (i.e. now officially destitute in a foreign country)? It'd be nice if there was ONE television station you can turn to for survivor information.</p></blockquote>

<p> Up4 (you need to login to Facebook to see it, hello walled garden!) sounds promising! Can&#39;t wait for the official blog post :-) on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2435391854">ActiveState Blog</a> or <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/">David Ascher&#39;s Blog</a>. Sounds like a great app to discuss at a Vancouver Facebook camp or at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampVancouver2007">BarCamp Vancouver 2007</a>! </p>

<blockquote> Use Up4 to express when you&#39;re open to doing something, and the kinds of activities you&#39;re up for. Up for the beach after work? Checking out a show Friday night? Or just hanging out Sunday afternoon? <br /> <br />Use Up4 and others can let you know they&#39;re up for it too. Up4 makes it easy to spend more time with your friends. <br /> <br />So... what are you up for? </blockquote>

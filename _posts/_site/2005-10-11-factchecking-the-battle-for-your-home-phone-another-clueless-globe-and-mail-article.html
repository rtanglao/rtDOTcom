<p>I love the Globe and Mail and I actually subscribe to their print edition. But I don't love their articles about computer hardware and software which are usually "me-too" or clueless. "The battle for your home" by Catherine McLean and Patrick Brethour (no link because of the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/08/18/not_linking_to_the_globe_and_mail_until_they_add_registration_required_to_all_their_links">Globe's silly registration required policy</a>) in the Saturday October 8, 2005 Edition is yet another one of these articles.

<p> It started innocently enough. I think it was 1978 (or was it 1977?); I saw my first microcomputer a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore Pet</a>, a chiclet keyboard PET with a cassette drive at a family friend&#39;s place in Pennsylvania. I was hooked. </p>
<p> By 1979, I was a Byte Magazine subscriber. I vividly recall the August 1979 Lisp Issue. Those August language issues were my favourite! </p>
<p> The rest is history: hacking in BASIC and 6502 Assembler language after my parents scrapped the money together to get me a PET with a real keyboard. Getting a TI-58C programmable calculator and hacking a hokey speed chess clock (remember that Ron?). Programming in C on a Commodore 64, my obsession with Usenet, thinking I was G*d with an Amiga in 4th year university, and then the Internet where blogging and RSS once more changed my life; the list goes on and on and on. </p>
<p> As <a href="http://blackrimglasses.com/">Ethan</a> <a href="http://blackrimglasses.com/archives/2007/06/02/how-i-got-into-technology/">wrote</a>, &quot;I got into technology because it called for me. </p>
<p> I&rsquo;m still in technology because I don&rsquo;t see any other way to be who I am, or want to be.&quot;  </p>

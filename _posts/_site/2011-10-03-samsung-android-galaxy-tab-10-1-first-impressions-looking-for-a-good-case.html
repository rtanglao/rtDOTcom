<p>On September 12, 2011 at the Mozilla All Hands all the employees (lucky us, thanks Mozilla!)&nbsp; each received a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P7510UWYXAB">Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1</a> (or an ASUS Transformer). First impressions of the Galaxy Tab:</p>
<ul><li>Heavy but useful as a great Google Reader client (I truly am addicted to Google Reader on all platforms: Firefox desktop, Android phone, iPhone and now Android tablet)</li><li>Great PDF displayer as a second screen for reading e.g. programming books while programming while using a computer</li><li>Built-in touch keyboard is not so great for me. Investigating Swype and Swiftkey</li><li>Needs a case, I am afraid of dropping it, can anybody recommend a good case?</li><li>Not nearly as much software as the iPad (I'd love something like World of Goo and Flipboard; Pulse is alright but :-) !)</li><li>Firefox Mobile Nightly with the new Tab interface is very sweet. I could happily just use it and no other apps except Google Reader!</li></ul>

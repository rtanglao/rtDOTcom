<p>So I am looking for a camera w/built-in Fuji X100-like hybrid viewfinder + interchangeable lenses. Anybody know of one :-) ? Perhaps Fuji will make one such camera in 2012? Pretty please? Oh and it would be so awesome if it had a GPS and WiFi connectivity built-in too so we can finally have a social camera that's not also a phone !</p>

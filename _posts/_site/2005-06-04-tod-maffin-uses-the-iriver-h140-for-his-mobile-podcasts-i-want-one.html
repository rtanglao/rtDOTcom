<p>And the iRiver H140 includes a cool mike (that some goalie used in Toronto to record during his hockey game, talk about sound seeing!) included. Unfortunately it's discontinued. Anybody want to sell me theirs? Or know someplace I can get it online or (preferably) in Vancouver? And if not, what should I get instead? I am leaning towards another iRiver (say the <a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/prod/hd/h10_5gb.aspx">iRiver H10</a> but it doesn't include a cool mike, can anybody suggest an equivalent?) iRivers suck in terms of UI but they seem to be the best MP3 records for under $US 500  that record with a decent sound quality since there is no iPod solution.   </p>

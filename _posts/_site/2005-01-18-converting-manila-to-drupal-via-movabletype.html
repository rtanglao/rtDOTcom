<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>This is a script, written in UserTalk (the language of Userland Frontier), which will export a Manila (or Weblogs.com, or Buzzword.com, or Weblogger, etc.) weblog to a file suitable for importing into Movable Type or TypePad. It will also write all of the images contained within the Manila site out to files, convert Manila discussion group threads into MT/TypePad comment threads, and convert any Manila News Item departments into post categories.</blockquote>

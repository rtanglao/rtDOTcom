<p>I’ll save you the trouble of reading the <a href="http://globelogger.com/file.php?id=158">PDF</a>: start syndicating (internally and externally) everything that matters to your organization.  If you don’t, you will lose big time long term.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.globelogger.com/item.php?id=104">GlobeLogger Press and Analysts: Harvard Business Review on Syndication</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>While syndication feeds may be a novelty right now, they&#8217;re proliferating fast, and customers will soon expect them of every company. I predict that within two years, not having a feed for your corporate news will be analogous to not having a Web site. It will mark you as unresponsive and retrograde. And if by then you&#8217;re not aggressively tapping feeds yourself, you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;re a step behind your more aware customers, suppliers, investors, and competitors.

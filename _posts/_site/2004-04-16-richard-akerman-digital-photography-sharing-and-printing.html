<blockquote>This site gathers together all the knowledge I have accumulated about digital photography. I see the same questions showing up in discussions again and again (the FAQ phenomenon) so I have created this page to provide a useful reference point, particularly for Canadians.

Keep in mind that when I started writing this, 3 Megapixels and 256 Megabytes of storage was state-of-the-art.</blockquote>

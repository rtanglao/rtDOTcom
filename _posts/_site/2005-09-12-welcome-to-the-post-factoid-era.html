<p>Amen! Mike! Less with the factoids and sound bites. More with the fact checking with links to back things up!</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>The reason we love blogs is Context. Bloggers point to the original sources, we maintain all of the context. We don't cut out little factoids and sound bites to spin a situation. That's why we sound genuine. We're not hiding anything behind a well crafted sound bite. It's just that simple.

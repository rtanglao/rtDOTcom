<p> I have to try this. Luv the cool effects you can get from the Adobe Lightroom Print module and would luv to post those to flickr and print at futureshop.ca or wherever. And yes this is the first part of my &#39;homage to lightroom&#39; series. And I will not be using the term &#39;Adobe Photoshop Lightroom&#39; because I think Photoshop is a necessary evil :-) ! In fact it should be the other way round. Photoshop should be re-imagined using the interface from Lighroom. </p>

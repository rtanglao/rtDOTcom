<p> After a half hour delay and some lunch and some badly needed ice coffee (it&#39;s positively tropical here today by Vancouver standards!), I am here at the <a href="http://adantehotel.com/">Adante Hotel</a>  (no aircon but I love the heat and it&#39;s nice and cool in my room!) at 610 Geary (thanks <a href="http://ptorgie.wordpress.com/">Petrina</a>!) working away on their free internet (no WiFi in the rooms). Looking forward to meeting with the peeps tonight at 6:45p.m.ish and to tomorrow&#39;s <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">Bloggercon</a>. Give me a call at 604 729 7924 if you want to meet up! </p>

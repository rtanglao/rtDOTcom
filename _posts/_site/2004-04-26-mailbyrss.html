<p>Very cool.  A great way to covert legacy mailing lists to RSS.  Need to try this.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.iupload.com/product/mailbyrss.asp">MailbyRSS Overview</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Using MailbyRSS is simple. Organizations need only to sign up to the service to receive a special e-mail address and password from iUpload and can immediately begin to author content for their RSS&#160;channel by sending it as an email. When MailbyRSS receives an authorized e-mail message, it automatically creates or updates an RSS&#160;channel and generates any supporting web pages required.</blockquote>

<p>As part of the planning process for the events at the Torino Olympics with <a href="http://newmediabc.com/">New Media BC</a>, <a href="http://mobilemuse.ca/">Mobile Muse</a> and <a href="http://www.raincitystudios.com/">Raincity Studios</a>, Kris and I met the folks at <a href="http://comvu.com/">Comvu</a>, yet another local Vancouver mobile company. They have a cool product: a way to broadcast from your mobile device (Windows Mobile only for now, but Linux and Symbian versions are coming soon, wish comvu had a blog :P so I could know more about what's happening because I know there's a fascinating story there that's not being told) LIVE to people on the Internet who can watch on their mobile devices or on a web browser on their desktops. A great complement to the timeshifting of videoblogging. In fact, apparently the live video is saved on server and has RSS so it could be video podcasted and blogged after the fact!</p>
<p>The Comvu demo was great. Wouldn't it be great if you could get this service bundled in with your mobile phone from your carrier for a reasonable monthly fee? Wouldn't it be great if you could see a demo of this during the Olympics and see how we can broadcast from our mobile devices from Torino to Vancouver and Vancouver to Torino? Well it's not a pipe dream; we'll do our best to make it a reality soon hopefully during the Olympics timeframe! And of course I am working to get them to give a demo at <a href="http://momovan.org/">MoMoVan</a> say in March or April.</p>

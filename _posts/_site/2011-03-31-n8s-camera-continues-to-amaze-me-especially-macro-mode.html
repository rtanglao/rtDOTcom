The <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2011/02/11/n8-review-nice-camera-shame-about-total-experience-which-hasnt-progressed-n80-ap">N8 camera software is awkward</a> and it pains me that the <a href="https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/52033387808043008">iPhone has become the social camera</a> instead of the N8 or other much better cameraphones but I still am in love with the photos it takes like this macro photo of a flower in Cedar Cottage.</p>

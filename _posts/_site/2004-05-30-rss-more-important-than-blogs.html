<p>RSS 2.0 already does comments in feeds.  I think that syndication (RSS , Atom, etc.) will be bigger than blogs but without blogs RSS wouldn’t be where it is today.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/05/its_the_feed_st.html">A VC: It’s The Feed Stupid</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>So, this means that the smart money is going to go into the feed space. Because that&#8217;s where the action is. Forget AdSense. I need contextual ads built right into my feed. Forget Typepad links, I need the links built right into my feed. Same with comments. And the feed needs to be two way. Atom has that capability I am told. So let me comment right in the feed. That&#8217;s a hell of lot better than Trackback.</blockquote>

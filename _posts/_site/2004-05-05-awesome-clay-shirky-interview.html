<p>The answer to “Describe that low, low moment when you thought you just might have to leave NYC for good.” is amazingly poignant! What a great story teller!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.gothamist.com/interview/archives/2004/04/09/clay_shirky_internet_technologist.php">Gothamist Interviews: Clay Shirky, Internet Technologist</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>39. Professor, writer, and consultant on internet technologies. I came from a state in the Midwest you probably have not heard of. When I was in high school, I wanted to be a lighting designer who worked on big Broadway musicals. My 16th birthday present was a trip to NYC, and after a couple of days here, I swore I'd move here, which I did, 4 days after I graduated from college. I have lived here ever since. I currently live opposite the dolphin in the kid's part of that little park on Congress Street, Brooklyn.</blockquote>

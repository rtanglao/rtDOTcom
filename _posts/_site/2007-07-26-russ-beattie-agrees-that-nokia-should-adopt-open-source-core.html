<blockquote><p>Point 4 is something I&rsquo;ve written about before: Symbian had its chance to reach critical mass, and didn&rsquo;t. It may continue to gain developers and new phones, but they&rsquo;ve hit the high water mark in terms of rate of adoption and units&hellip; From this point on, Symbian is going to be doing that slow fade into technological obscurity. Let me put it like this: Symbian is not a platform that any true innovators would ever base their ideas on going forward, and without innovation an OS is dead. Once Nokia moves on to something else, it&rsquo;ll quickly go away forever. And what would Nokia move to? Linux of course - as shown by their two outstanding web tablets the 770 and N800. The quicker Nokia starts moving that OS to their top-tier mobile phones, the better, IMHO.</p></blockquote>

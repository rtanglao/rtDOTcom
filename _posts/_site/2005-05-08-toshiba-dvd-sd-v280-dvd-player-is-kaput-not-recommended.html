<p>After only 2 years and 4 months, the DVD player part of our <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=toshiba+dvd+sd-v280&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Toshiba DVD SD-V280 combo DVD/VCR</a> has died. All discs (MP3, CD, DVD, etc.) are now "Incorrect disc". Incredibly bad. This s*cks. Not recommended! At least the VCR still works, but for how long? Can anybody recommend a DVD player that will work with the component video inputs of our Toshiba 20" TV?</p>

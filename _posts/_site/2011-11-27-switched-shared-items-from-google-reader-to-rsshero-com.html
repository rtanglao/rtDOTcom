<p>For the two of you besides Boris and <a href="http://justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> who subscribed to my Google Reader Shared items, I have switched to RSS Hero (made by <a href="http://kalv.co.uk/">Kalv</a> with vision by <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a>, thanks guys! Where I do pay? I don't want ads, I want to pay now). WARNING: RSS Hero is alpha software for thrill seekers only :-) but the ride has been smooth so far and is going to be great!</p>

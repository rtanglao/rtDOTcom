<p>Excellent. The Ruby on Rails juggernaut of apps continues.  For hackers only at this point or power users who don't need a web interface.</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&lt;p&gt;&gt;Typo is an absolutely minimal weblogging engine which comes without an admin interface. Its configured the first time you start it using a simple web form and after that you use it by posting from a rich desktop client application like MarsEdit or similar ( see below for a list of compatible clients ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<b>UNQUOTE</b>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

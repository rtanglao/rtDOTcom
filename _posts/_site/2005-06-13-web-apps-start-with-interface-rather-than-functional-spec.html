<p>This sounds reasonable for web apps. Read the 69 comments for some great debate. I think the important take away is to design what is most crucial first and for web apps that's the interface (and it may be different for your particular application domain).</p>

<blockquote>Getting Real is all about starting from the user interface and customer experience and then building out. Visual design first, programming second.

We think that's backwards.</blockquote>

<p>Eveylyn nails it.  Sounds like growing up to me!

<p>From <a href="http://evelynrodriguez.typepad.com/crossroads_dispatches/2005/03/robert_scoble_h_1.html">Crossroads Dispatches: Markets in Flux: You Gotta Go Back and Understand Where Blogging Came From</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>for many, we've moved from seeking prosperity as a primary motivator to seeking authenticity and integrity.</p>

<p>We've moved away from spitting out polished thirty-second pitches to dropping the burden of a facade. We want to be accepted for ourselves (or even better, reach a juncture where praise or criticism is besides the point), have richer conversations, heartfelt connections and reclaim our voice.

<p>Below Robert says we were disgusted with how corporations were behaving. Maybe that's half of the equation. In addition, I was disgusted with how I was behaving (inauthentically) and the dissonance finally gave way.</p></blockquote>

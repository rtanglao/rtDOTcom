<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Now enter RSS. Imagine if every software system in your business published an RSS feed. Imagine if every important project in your company had its own blog.

Imagine having immediate, reliable notification of important events going all the way up the management chain as soon as they occur. Now that's life changing!</p></blockquote>

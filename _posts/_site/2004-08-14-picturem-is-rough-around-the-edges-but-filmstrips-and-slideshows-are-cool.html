<p>Check out <a href="http://picturem.com/roland/BlogSpace">my PictureM Blog</a>.  Looks very rough and hard to use.  But hey it’s still in beta, right? Isn’t everything? The <a href="/rt/javascript:openWin('/roland/BlogSpace/default/4S5IO8JHQJ/_filmstrip-')">Filmstrip</a> and <a href="/rt/javascript:openWin('/roland/BlogSpace/default/4S5IO8JHQJ/_slideshow-')">Slideshow</a> features are very cool but again are unpolished and non-intuitive as well as non linkable (the preceding links to my slideshow and my filmstrip are Javascript links that therefore don’t work!).  I think there’s some real potential here ; I’ll wait for 2.0.  Until then I’ll use <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (disclosure: I am addicted to Flickr; <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/">I have uploaded over 2000 pictures there</a> and I know and like Caterina and Stewart, 2 of the key Flickr people!).</p>

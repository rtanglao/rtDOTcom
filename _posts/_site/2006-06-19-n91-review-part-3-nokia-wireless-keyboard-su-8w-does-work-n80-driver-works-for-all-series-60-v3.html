Colin of All about N91 <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/user/all-about-n91">commented</a> that the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/popupDisclaimer?productId=452&amp;categoryId=18&amp;disclaimerId=9&amp;fileId=11493&amp;languageId=1">N80/Series 60 v3 SU-8W driver</a> should work and it does, thanks! D'oh. It's very confusing to figure out which device runs which variant of Series 60. In my sleep deprived state, I mistakenly thought the N90 was also a Series 60 v3 device. Nokia, please update the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,67023,00.html">SU-8W driver page</a> (and also build this into the OS or pre-install it!).

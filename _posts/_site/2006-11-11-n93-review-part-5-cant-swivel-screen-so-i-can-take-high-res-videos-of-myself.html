Is there a way to turn the N93 screen so that I can see myself while shooting a 640x480 30fps movie? There doesn't seem to be which is a major disappointment since I planned on doing lots of "me as talking head" full resolution videos.  I can turn the screen and look at myself while filming but then it uses the secondary camera which films at CIF resolution. Please fix in the post version 20  N93 firmware update (<a href="http://www.gadgetnutz.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=232">N93 Firmware version 20.0.58 doesn't appear to have it</a>).

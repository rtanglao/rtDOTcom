The very rudimentary WYSIWYG mode in ecto is not so great but it's far better than staring at HTML code (which I know, love and curse daily). So much as I'd love to, I can't use <a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/346/marsedit-12-growl-picasa-and-vox">MarsEdit 1.2</a> since it still doesn't have a WYSIWYG mode. Still using ecto! Alas, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/08/25/ecto_implements_pseduo_wysiwyg_for_blog_writers_including_seamless_integrated_image_upload_support">no progress has been made in WYSIWYG Mac blog editor's since ecto introduced it in 2004</a> :-( ! It's 2007, could we please have a real WYSIWYG mode in Mac blog editors? I know that true WYSIWYG is hard but even something that moves the state of the art forward like handling nested lists properly would be great!

Unfortunately <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/05/15/ecto-instead-of-marsedit-because-it-cant-handle-100s-of-categories">neither ecto or MarsEdit have a  solution that can handle 100s of categories</a> (how about some kind of auto-complete?) that Drupal free tagging allows you to create as pioneered by del.icio.us and flickr!

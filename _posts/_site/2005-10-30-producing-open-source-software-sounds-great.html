<p>Sounds like a must read!

<p>From <a href="http://wp.osafoundation.org/2005/10/26/producing-open-source-software/">Ted Leung reviews Producing Open Source Software</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p><p>Open Source Software is more than just software that has an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license. It's a whole development style and culture. Karl Fogel is one of the developers of the Subversion project, and has been involved with a number of open source projects. He's distilled the lessons he's learned about the development style and culture in the book Producing Open Source Software. This is a really practical book, and deals with many of the day to day issues involved with working in open source projects. In particular, I found the section on Setting the Tone and the chapters on Communications and Managing Volunteers to be especially well done.</p></p></blockquote>

<p>Blogs and other media don’t have to actually be real or immediate, just have to give the appearance of it!
Liveness codes in the blogosphere - nowess of time of writing, referring to discourse (I am writing this now), vividi verbal details of personal experieness)
Some form of unmediated behaviour, the impression of “rushedness”, the “continuity of text”.
“Yeah cool, I think I just pe*d in my pants”. - lose control and do things live - example of blog post</p>

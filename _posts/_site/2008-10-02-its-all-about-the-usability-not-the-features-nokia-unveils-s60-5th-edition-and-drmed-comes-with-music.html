<p><a href="http://saunderslog.com/wp-content/uploads/S60-PR.pdf">S60 5th edition</a> and touch <em>sounds</em> good but if it’s not in an <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2007/07/21/1312">easier to use form than the current S60</a>, it’s useless. And I am sorry but DRM’ed Windows only music doesn’t work for me (I don’t buy DRMed music from anybody including Apple)! Anyways Apple badly needs competition in the usability department so my fingers are crossed that this represents some sort of competitive threat to them. Go Nokia go! Viva la compétition!</p>

	Comes with Music (press release, backgrounder) is Nokia’s new digital entertainment service. When you buy a supported Nokia device, including the NSeries, any of the XPressMusic phones and some other mass market phones, Nokia gives you access to the Nokia Music store at no additional charge for an entire year. Download (and keep) as many tracks as you like. This is not a subscription. You get to download and keep as many tracks as your heart desires. Tracks are delivered in Windows Media format, with DRM.
	</p>
	<p>
	S60 5th Edition (press release) was also introduced. This latest operating system release includes support for new displays, the touch UI, a widescreen mode, a variety of new sensor support, and updated applications and browser support. Wonderfully cool things are possible with the new sensor support, like being able to stop the ringer by picking the phone up and putting it back down face down.

	A touch screen phone and operating system were not unexpected. After all, Nokia had to respond to Apple’s phenomenal success with iPhone. However, the gutsy decision to give away the music goes straight after Apple’s cash cow, iTunes.

	Scorched earth is a powerful offensive posture. One wonders what kind of deal with the devil RIAA Nokia had to agree to in order to gain the rights to distribute all those tracks for no money… and what the impact will be on their bottom line.
	</p>
	<p>
	Look for 5800 XpressMusic devices with North American standard radios to land here Q1 2009. Exciting times are ahead.

<p>Better late than never, Globe and Mail. Here's to Rogers coming to their senses and offering the iPhone at an affordable price to Canadians soon.</p>

  Canadians would have to <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/09/06/technology/05cndapple.php">pay $400 for the iPhone</a>, and to use all the iPhone features, <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2087/125/">about $300 a month in voice and data fees</a> (the iPhone is a heavy user of mobile data transfer). By comparison, AT&amp;T, the sole company offering the iPhone in the United States, allows a plan for $100 that includes 1,350 minutes of voice calls, unlimited data, video voice mail, 200 text messages and unlimited use nights and weekends.

  <p>The iPhone would be too expensive for Canadians to buy even if they had a data plan that charged them $100 a month.</p>

  <p>So far, Rogers has been sitting on its hands, unwilling to cut its rates because it is still unsure whether there would be enough of a market for the iPhone to offset such a major cut.</p>

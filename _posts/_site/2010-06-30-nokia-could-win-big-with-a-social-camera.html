<p>Dave Winer has been writing for many years about a <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/06/29/dearCanonTimeToAddCommunic.html">social camera</a>. I have been writing for years about how ShoZu + Nokia Cameraphones are killer apps and built-in ShoZu would be a killer app (e.g. <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/07/26/nokia-buy-shozu-and-be-done-with-it">Nokia should buy ShoZu</a>).</p>
<p>My current thinking is:</p>
<p>Canon or Nikon's sensors and lens + &nbsp;Nokia phone with "comes with world wide connectivity and built-in easy to use app for uploading photos and HD video to all popular social sites e.g. flickr, facebook, picasa" + sideload to your Computer and OVI files (i.e. Eye-fi done right, not as an aftermarket kludge - don't get me wrong, unlike Dave I love my Eye-Fi card; it's done well but at the end of the day it's a hack!) for backup in real time using ShoZu-like technology to do it in the background and auto-resume if connectivity lost &nbsp;=</p>
<p><strong>an awesome social camera that would sell well</strong></p>
<p>The current Nokia solution is Share Online which is:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">a) hard to use&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">b) hard to configure&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">c) doesn't work in the &nbsp;background and auto-resume like ShoZu &nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 10px;">d) requires folks to figure out the whole "3G/WiFi don't automatically switch to 3G when I am roaming" dance</span></li></ul>
<p>As Dave points out if Nokia doesn't do it (and Nokia is the only company with all the pieces including camera hardware and software, ShoZu-like tech, etc) and the biz dev clout to do something like a "Comes with bandwidth" partnership like Amazon did for the Kindle), somebody else will do it e.g. Apple or Google or some social camera upstart.</p>

The <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> crew rocks! Thanks to <a href="http://www.caterina.net/">Caterina</a> for <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/09/11/flickrbugs_flickr_slideshows_dont_support_groups">replying</a> to my previous bug report about slideshows not working with groups (answer: they will!)
<br />While I have their ear, here's another one
</p>
<p>
If I post a photo via email and the subject of the email has a period (i.e. '.') in it, then all text after that period is lost.
</p>
<p>
e.g. St. Peter's Lemon and Ginger Ale is truncated to:
<br />St.
</p>
<p>
Please fix! I am sure that this is on the list but you never know so I am posting it here.

<p> Apple tablet is coming if not today, soon since the iPhone (bonus relevant analysis: <a href="http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2007/05/entering_iphone.html"> before iPhone and after iPhone</a>) is just a wee tablet that has call processing (to use a Nortel/Bellhead-ism and to all the doubters Apple has done everything that the iPhone does before except call processing which is not trivial  and GSM/EDGE/3G which I have to concede is even less trivial). Looking forward to the next installment of the Apple soap opera ... er keynote :-) in 1.5 hours! </p>

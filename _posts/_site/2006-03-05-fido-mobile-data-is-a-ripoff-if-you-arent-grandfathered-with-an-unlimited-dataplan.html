<p>[NOTE: Since I don't believe in whingeing :-), this will be my last post complaining about high mobile internet rates in Canada. My last post about this was:<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/12/13/wireless-data-in-canada-is-ridiculously-expensive-boris-is-right"> Wireless data in Canada is ridiculously expensive | Boris is right</a>.]</p>

<p>I am very lucky to have my grandfathered unlimited mobile data plan from Fido of $50. Last month I used 252 MB of traffic (I am guessing about 75% was transmitting N70 cameraphone 2 megapixel photos via Shozu to <a href="http://roland.blip.tv/">flickr</a> and 25% transmitting N70 cameraphone videos MPEG 4 of between 1-3MB each via  Shozu to <a href="http://roland.blip.tv/">roland.blip.tv</a>)
</p>
<p>Here’s how much it would have cost if I wasn’t grandfathered :</p>
<ol>
<li>500 KB plan: $5 + 251 * 30 = $7535
</li><li>5 MB plan: $25 + (252 - 5) * 10 = $2495</li>
<li>25 MB plan: $50 + (252 - 25) * 30 = $6860</li>
<li>50 MB plan: $75 + (252 - 75) * 30 = $5385</li>
<li>100 MB plan: $100 + (252 - 100) * 30 = $4660</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess the $50 that I pay is a lot cheaper than $2495 or even $7535 that others have to pay, eh :-) ?!?!</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that you have to pay "4 &cent; per KB while roaming internationally" (which I guess includes the US). I don't have to pay this roaming fee in the US with my grandfathered plan. 
</p>
<p>Very interesting and very depressing for Canadians who actually want to create and share their mobile phone's photos and videos using the mobile internet i.e. without going through the "mobile phone to PC via Bluetooth or USB" chain of pain. Can somebody do the math for Rogers, Telus and Bell? Love to know if they are any cheaper! But somehow I doubt it!</p>

<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver01">DemoCamp Vancouver01</a> is going to rock on May 24th.

Idea people will be presenting innovations on all things ranging from business to charity, high-technology to high-art. The purpose is to encourage a cross-pollination of industries and individuals in hopes that people engaged in unrelated endeavors might provide an enlightening perspective on the presenters concept. There is strength in diversity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yes, that's right, we're redefining "Demo", but at the same time, showing a connection between all the bright people across Canada and beyond who are gathering to share cool ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>The Idea is your Demo</strong><br /> Your concept or idea should be developed enough to support a three minute presentation, but it is not necessary to have a working model to "demo" … it's the idea that's important! There are three minutes for delivery and three minutes for discussion. The time limit is strict so if you take two and a half minutes to setup your laptop, you only get thirty seconds to present. (the gong hath no mercy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>Submitting your Presentation</strong><br /> There are two ways!  In advance <a href="mailto:democampvancouver@gmail.com">via e-mail</a> or posting to the wiki.  Two submissions will be selected by the organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; or…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day of by writing your idea (in one brief sentence) on the wall. Attendees will then choose the two most appealing subjects for presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>Your Feedback</strong><br /> The purpose is not simply to provide critical feedback but also encouragement to the innovators with the courage to get up there. Discuss, ask questions, find the holes, find the strengths…make the ideas better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; <strong>Follow Up</strong><br /> Ideas are good but made great by their implementation. Abstract, theoretical discussion is encouraged but we hope that people will bring concepts to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Location: First <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCampVancouver01">DemoCampVancouver01</a> event is going to be at <a href="http://barcamp.org/WorkSpace">WorkSpace</a> (<a href="http://abetterplacetowork.com/contact%29.">http://abetterplacetowork.com/contact).</a>&lt;/p&gt;</span>&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br /><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

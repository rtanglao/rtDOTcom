As I said at <a href="http://wiki.northernvoice.ca/PhotoCamp">Photo Camp</a> I kind of feel that I've grown up with it as I watched the program improve from Beta 1 to 4 to 1.0 and listened to the Podcasts and except for the lack of unsharp mask functionality, it really is a "do ALL of your digital photography workflow" for serious amateurs who shoot a lot of "giggage" and heck it seems like a lot of pros are using it too (and unlike Aperture it runs on my three year old Powerbook G4). Anything requiring more editing requires a program like PhotoShop or Elements, etc. I definitely am saving my pennies and hope to buy Lightroom at the initial offer price of $US 199.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I only wish that I had felt better so I would have taken more photos; it seems that every Northern Voice I end up being a little sick. More rest for 2008!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FROM <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/25/High-End-Compact-Cameras">ongoing Â· Photo Camp and High-End Compacts</a>: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a lot of talk on workflow, something that is increasingly becoming an issue for your average digicam hobbyist. In particular, Roland Tanglao gave a presentation on Adobe Lightroom, and Adobe ought to put that boy on commission, because I bet fifty people are going to buy it. That would include me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

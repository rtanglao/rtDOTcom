<p>I am sad that they are leaving (but <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/">my almost 12000 photos</a> (11970 as I write this) will still be on Flickr) but I am glad they took the money and I wouldn't be surprised to see them back here in Vancouver to do the next big thing in a couple of years time! (e.g. I want video in a Flickr stylee: i.e. easy to use and attractive and social).</p>

<blockquote><p>We're having a party this Thursday in Vancouver to say goodbye to all our friends, Flickr members and other supporters before our big move to California. Please come!
</p>
<p>It will be at the Alibi Room (which is on Water Street near Main Street in Gas Town). Call up your Vankie cousins and get a spot on their couch for the night. Seattle people, this means YOU!
</p>
<p>It starts at 7:30 PM, and goes until 1 AM. Please come &amp; meet some fellow Flickring fiends! And sing Auld Lang Syne or whatever to see us off. Please RSVP on Upcoming.org so we know how many Swedish meatballs we need.</p></blockquote>

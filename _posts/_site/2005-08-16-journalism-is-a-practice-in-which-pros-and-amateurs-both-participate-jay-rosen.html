<p>Go Jay go! Read <a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/08/14/sant_jrl.html#comments">the whole thing</a>! My opinion: if you can write about something with perspective informed by expertise of the subject matter in a compelling manner than you are "doing" journalism, trained or not!</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p><p>I used to teach it implicitly: journalism is a profession. Now I think it's a practice, in which pros and amateurs both participate. There were good things about the professional model, and we should retain them. But it's the strength of the social practice that counts, not the health of any so-called profession. That is what J-schools should teach and stand for, I believe. I don't care if they're called professional schools. They should equip the American people to practice journalism by teaching the students who show up, and others out there who may want help.</p></p></blockquote>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ol><li>Granville and Robson truly were the epicentre of action that day!</li><li>No photos uploaded from Granville Island </li><li>No photos uploaded from The Drive - East Van was almost totally unaffected by the Olympics which corresponds with my experience. East of Gastown there was no Olympic visitors and not nearly as much buzz.</li></ol>

<p>This totally aligns with my experience.  Most under 40s don't pay for newspapers no  matter how 'good' or 'well written' they are.  And most can see through newspapers and view them with indifference ; certainly not as authorities.

<p>From <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,65813,00.html">Wired News: Newspapers Should Really Worry</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine what higher-ups at the Post must have thought when focus-group participants declared they wouldn't accept a Washington Post subscription even if it were free. The main reason (and I'm not making this up): They didn't like the idea of old newspapers piling up in their houses.

<p>Don't think for a minute that young people don't read. On the contrary, they do, many of them voraciously. But having grown up under the credo that information should be free, they see no reason to pay for news. Instead they access The Washington Post website or surf Google News, where they select from literally thousands of information sources. They receive RSS feeds on their PDAs or visit bloggers whose views mesh with their own. In short, they customize their news-gathering experience in a way a single paper publication could never do. And their hands never get dirty from newsprint.</p></blockquote>

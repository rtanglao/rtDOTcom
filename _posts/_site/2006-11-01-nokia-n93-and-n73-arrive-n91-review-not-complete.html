<p> Still haven&#39;t finished my <a href="/rt/tags/n91-review">Nokia N91 review</a> (unfortunately my review of the Series 60 v3 OS won&#39;t be the kindest since even with just Lifeblog and Opera Mini and the latest firmware, my N91 is still unstable after snapping about 50 pictures so it&#39;s not a ShoZu issue <a href="/rt/archives/2006/10/11/n91-review-part-14-shozu-still-rocks-but-is-not-stable-on-my-n91">as I implied previously</a>) and <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/">Andy Abramson</a> and Brooke sent out the N93 and N73 which I received today! Wow! Mobile Christmas at Halloween. And the N93! I thought the next phones in the program were the N80 and N73!  Thanks to Nokia and Communicano for continuing to allow me to review phones frankly and honestly! </p>
<p> One problem: the N93 only came with a 128MB card, which is not going to be enough for my videoblogging experiments with it and the N73 didn&#39;t come with a card. </p>
<p> The pressure is on. Need to get the N91 review finished. I think I am going to go to Future Shop and buy a card tomorrow for the N93. I&#39;ll finish my N91 review shortly. In the meantime I&#39;ll use the N73 and the N93 without a SIM. </p>

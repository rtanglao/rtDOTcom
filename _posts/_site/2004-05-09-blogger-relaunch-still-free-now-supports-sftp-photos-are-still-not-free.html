But awesome new templates and <a href="http://help.blogger.com/bin/answer.py?answer=91&#38;topic=14">sFTP support</a>.  Congrats!</p>

<blockquote>In 1999, Blogger was launched as a side project to help make it easy for a few Web geeks to update their homepages. That side project soon became the real deal and Google acquired us in 2003. Our new world is fantastic. Even the food here is amazing. In fact, it may have been Chef Charlie's kitchen creations that kickstarted our thinking and put this pivotal idea in our heads: You Power Blogger. The features of a better, easier, and totally free Blogger have started landing. Climb aboard and let us show you around.</blockquote>

<p>OK. Sorry for being so impolite, Charlie. I was frustrated. HuginAndMugin is so close and yet so far. Java is really useless to me if it can take 1 megapixel photos because I bought my Nokia 7610 phone mostly for moblogging! I didn't know Gallery, Camera, etc. were written in Java. I assumed they were written in C/C++ since they work properly with the camera and take advantage of the full 1 megapixel resolution. I thought erroneously that was not possible from Java.</p>

<p>So assuming that it can be done, could you Charlie please put me and the HuginAndMugin developer (Simon) in touch with somebody (or point us to a forum where we can post our source code and our problems) who can help us modify HuginAndMugin to take 1 megapixel photos on my 7610? Simon has told me it couldn't be done because the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/07/17/nokia_6680_j2me_still_doesnt_allow_photos_larger_than_640x480#comment6025">7610 doesn't implement JSR 135 completely</a>. I guess you are saying Simon is wrong. Prove us wrong and we'll be forever grateful and I bet <a href="http://www.thisismobility.com/blog/?p=15">Mike</a> would be too! You can contact me on this blog or via email to roland AT rolandtanglao.com or via my 7610 mobile phone at +1 604 729 7924.</p>

<blockquote><p>yeah, i know what you mean. i've been held back many times due to the limited funcitonality of the java api implementations (e.g. bluetooth, gallery, camera, running modes, to name a few)</p>

<p>actually, since i posted that comment, i've been thiking of how to rig up a service without needing any app on the phone, but being able to integrate closely and easily with the phone.</p>

<p>it's a nice mental challenge while i'm on holiday.

<p>tchau,</p>

<p>ps and one more thing, actually the most popular apps in java are single-user, non-neworked games - it's all you can effectively do in the java sandbox.</p></blockquote>

Congrats and good luck to the Qumana crew!

I have been an unofficial (and of course unpaid) advisor to these folks for many moons.  I love their vision of a drag and drop microcontent remixer for blogs initially (and the world later!).   Qumana's current state reminds me of the early days of the <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>: lots of unrealized potential.  Fred has an ace marketer in <a href="http://blog.wirearchy.com/">Victor</a> and an ace visionary in <a href="http://blog.wirearchy.com/">Jon</a>.  Now all <a href="http://www.qumana.com/">Qumana</a> needs is an ace social software developer like <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal</a> and an ace social software interface lead like <a href="http://sylloge.com/personal/">Stewart</a> and the rest is blood, sweat and code (and money!).

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>Conversation is the kingdom.

<p>The war is over and the army that wasn't even fighting - the army of all of us, the ones who weren't in charge, the ones without the arms - won. The big guys who owned the big guns still don't know it. But they lost.</p>

<p>In our media 2.0, web 2.0, post-media, post-scarcity, small-is-the-new-big, open-source, gift-economy world of the empowered and connected individual, the value is no longer in maintaining an exclusive hold on things. The value is no longer in owning content or distribution.
</p>
<p>The value is in relationships. The value is in trust.</p></blockquote>

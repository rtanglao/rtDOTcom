<p>This one of <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/blog/135">Andy Smith</a> is my favourite (somehow I forgot to switch my camera to ASA 400 so these photos are even more blurry than usual!).  The meetup was fun (great conversations with <a href="http://geekgirl.web-goddess.net/">Devon</a> among others) and I look forward to meeting more bloggers in person at the next one.  Thanks, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/">Darren</a> for organizing it!

I don't need any new features in S60 FP2. Please fix the following bugs:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.realtime-unifiedcommunications.com/mobilityfixed_mobille_converge/2007/02/the_nokia_n80i_and_some_applic.htm">Memory Management</a> (may not be a bug, maybe N series phones just need much more memory, my guestimate would be double the current memory)</li>
<li><a href="http://forum.shozu.com/showthread.php?tid=445&amp;pid=947#pid947">Thumbnail race condition with ShoZu</a> (might be a ShoZu bug but just in case! I want my reliable ShoZu back! ShoZu on the pre S60V3 devices seemed much more reliable).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Making multiple apps run fine without running out of memory (I can make all of my N series phones run out of memory by simply running the S60 browser, surfing to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland">flickr.com/photos/roland</a> and using the Nokia wireless keyboard) and ShoZu work perfectly would greatly improve the S60 user experience in my opinion!

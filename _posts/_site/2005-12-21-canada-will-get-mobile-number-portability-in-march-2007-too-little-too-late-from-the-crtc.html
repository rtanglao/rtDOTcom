<p>The oligopoly and the CRTC compromise on a deadline that's too little too late. It shouldn't take 18 months! How about July 2006 for Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa and March 2007 for the rest of the country? That would be something that would almost be acceptable. Corporations always talk about the need for world class infrastructure and taxes; how about putting their money where their mouth is and implementing world class mobile number portability sooner rather than later? </p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>The CRTC yesterday issued its much-anticipated decision involving the implementation of wireless number portability.  The Commission mandated number portability by March 14, 2007, about six months faster than the industry proposed, though not exactly the &quot;expeditious&quot; implementation that the government called for last February.</blockquote>

<p>This is cool but why not support the MetaWeblogAPI as well so we can have titles?</p>

<blockquote>So, Mark and I have yet another project in the works. I can't go into any detail about it at the moment, but one aspect is IM integration.

Your blog software must support the Blogger API. It must implement the following Blogger API methods: getUserInfo, getUsersBlogs, newPost, deletePost. These are the commands that the service supports.</blockquote>

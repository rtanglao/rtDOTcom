<p>Great idea! I wish I had the bandwidth and money to do this.  Hmmm.  Working on it!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://migs.paraz.com/w/index.php?p=168#comments">What is Not Â» Music Hosting Project</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>My idea is to host local music in ways that aren&#8217;t possible right now. Artists often rely on free web sites which do not allow the hosting of large media files, and disallow remote linking from other sites.

I would also like to promote the use of BitTorrent for album-size collections of lossless music formats, as opposed to the usual MP3 which is lossy. With lossless formats, the listeners can burn a CD of the album that is an exact copy of the original.

To do this, the artists need to upload to my server or give me a copy. This can either be in the format used for distribution, or an uncompressed format (such as a WAV file). For lossless distribution, I prefer the OGG Vorbis (.ogg file) format since it does not have the patent restrictions of MP3.

I don&#8217;t have any website for organizing the content. I am not a web designer. I will simply make the files available for HTTP, FTP or BitTorrent download.</blockquote>

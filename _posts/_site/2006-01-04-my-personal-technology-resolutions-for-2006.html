<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>1) Get an iPod and go all digital
Yeah, I owned an iPod--and I gave it to my kid. This time, around, I want a video iPod and I want to move all my music over to digital--and figure out a media storage solution that works as well.<br />
2) Upgrade my phone and add a decent video camera to it--with clogging and podcast components.<br />
3) Start podcasting weekly-- a friend had a great idea--I still want to do it.<br />
4) Move my blog to a new domain and get off blogspot. Aanyone need explanations on that?<br />
5) Upgrade from my friend's digital camera to my own--and buy flickr pro--got it for my client, need to add my own access.<br />
6) Tag more. I think tagging is amazing, but I avoid doing it. Change that a bit.<br />
7) Get a decent new computer--or a cheap back up machine.<br />
8) Do more new tools beta testing on a weekly basis--using that back-up machine I wanna establish.<br />
9) Learn more--a lot more--about extreme programming--as I got more and more into product development this is a critical area to build competency.<br />
10) Keep having fun with technology--it's gotta be both enjoyable and useful--and it can be.<br />
11) Turn off my land line phone for good--between the VOIP options and the cell, the $$ I am paying is a waste.<br />
12) Buy a big TV. Yeah, I don't watch it, but it's time to upgrade from 19 inches, doncha think?<br />
13) Card scanning or something--figure out something to do with all those business cards that are stacked in bowls around my office. I do want to talk to some of these folks again.</blockquote>

<p>If the Nokia Pureview 808 hype (<a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2012/02/27/nokia-808-pureview-%E2%80%93-revolutionary-camera-technology-great-smartphone/">Nokia</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/27/nokia-announces-808-pureview-belle-os-4-inch-display-41-megap/">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/27/2827158/nokia-808-pureview-launch-pictures-video-preview">Verge</a>, <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/14322_Nokia_at_MWC_2012_Live.php">AAS</a>) :-) (Xenon flash, continuous focus 1080p video, 34 megapixels for still images, pentaband HSDPA, Symbian Belle) is to be believed, the Nokia Pureview 808 has a 41 Megapixel sensor which downsamples 7 pixels into 1 which means awesome images. 5 years in the making! Anyhow as somebody who as taken over 50000 photos with Nokia cameraphones since 2004, I need to review this immediately :-) ! Glad to see that <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/PhoneDaz">Damian</a> and the rest of the Nokia cameraphone team are still having fun and producing kick a*s cameraphone modules!</p>

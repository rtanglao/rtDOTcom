An N95 with <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/07/03/competing-with-iphone-plan-a-and-plan-b-for-nokia">double the RAM</a> and a better battery in addition to <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/07/22/rui-on-how-nokia-can-beat-the-iphone">much better marketing</a> would be a worthy competitor to the iPhone (since it could run multiple programs without crashing unlike the N93 and N95 today) at least until a "real" Nokia iPhone competitor comes out. Go Nokia go!

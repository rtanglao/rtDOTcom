<p>Is it just me or is this an understatement in humility :-) ?!? Regardless, I won't be paying for the NYT for their "distinct voice". I'd rather continue to pay for the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Gruber</a> and the <a href="http://kottke.org/">Kottke</a> and <a href="/rt/burningbird">the Bird</a> (Shelley I'd love to pay where do I sign?), etc. whose voices are much more distinct than the mostly cr*ppy NYT voices.</p>

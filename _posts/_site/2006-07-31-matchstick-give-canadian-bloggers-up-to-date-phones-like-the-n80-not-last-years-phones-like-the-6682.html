<p> My only real objection to <a href="http://matchstick.ca">Matchstick</a>&#39;s program is that they are giving out obsolete phones like the Nokia 6682.  Matchstick, don&#39;t treat Canadians like they live in a mobile ghetto/backwater (perhaps the truth is we do :-( unfortunately). Give the Matchstick bloggers an up to date quad band phone like the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/n80">N80</a> not yesterday&#39;s news like the 6682. If the Nokia Blogger Relations Program can give out up to date phones to Canadians and Americans, I don&#39;t see why Matchstick can&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote> Fortuitous timing, I needed a mobile upgrade. The Nokia 6682 replaces my 20060729-1436_005Nokia 3595. I&rsquo;ll be entering the modern world with photo/video/mp3 capabilities. The old 3595 had Java apps, web browsing and email, but they were cumbersome and ugly. </blockquote>
<blockquote> I&rsquo;m not going to post a ridiculously long DPReview-styled analysis of the phone. The release date was over a year ago and that information is already widely disseminated. This will be a personal account of my experience with the Nokia 6682.

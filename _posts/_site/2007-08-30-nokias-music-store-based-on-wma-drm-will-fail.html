<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks for <a href="http://www.womworld.com/nseries/2007/08/31/will-the-nokia-music-store-fail/">the link Nseries WOM World</a>. For the record, I think the Nokia Music store could be successful if they sold non DRM&#39;ed music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRM s*cks! Apple&#39;s Fairplay s*cks! WMA DRM s*cks! The market has spoken and Apple&#39;s DRM has won. WMA DRM is dead and in the long run so is Fairplay (un DRM&#39;ed music is the future!) so launching a music store based on DRM is folly. I want Nokia to be successful but basing a music store in 2007 on Microsoft&#39;s DRM is wrong. Hopefully Nokia will drop the Windows DRM and start selling un DRM&#39;ed music real soon now.</p>

As I see it, the only thing going for it is PayPal support. &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>No pressure Derek. But can't wait to get the CD! Looking forward to playing it loud and also am loving the fact that I know that the money I paid went directly to the artist (of course PayPal got a little). </p>

<blockquote><p>UPDATE: I'd better get cracking. I already have at least three people (Roland included) who want to buy the thing, and I don't even have my music page updated with the info. I'll still take their money and send them early copies if they want, though! </p> <p>Copies of my debut CD have finally arrived, and I'll soon be making them available for sale. In the meantime, you can check out photos and listen to all the podsafe tunes (plus more) for free at my Penmachine Podcast page.</p></blockquote>

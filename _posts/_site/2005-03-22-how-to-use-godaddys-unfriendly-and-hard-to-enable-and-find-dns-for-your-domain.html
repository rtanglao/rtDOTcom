<p>You get what you pay for :-) ! Even for technical people it's difficult to find and configure GoDaddy's DNS. Summary: add Total DNS to your account (it used to be that you have to add it to old domains, I believe it's automagically turned on for new domains) and then you have to configure it.  More info at the <a href="http://www.streamlinewebco.com/blog/_archives/2004/5/3/51406.html">GoDaddy HOWTO</a> I wrote a while back! </p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>But apparently, unless you're also hosting with GoDaddy, that does not include DNS. I've hunted all over the site looking for a way to map domains to an IP address, and while they will "forward" the doman (not what I want) they won't map it. I then called their tech support line, was told the wait would be two minutes, and hung up after fifteen (and the ads, these guys are always pushing stuff at you).
</p>
<p>So my first question is -- is there a way to get GoDaddy to map a domain? How?</p></blockquote>

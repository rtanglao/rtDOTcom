I want audio search now! I hope somebody challenges Google so we get some real competition in audio search unlike today where Google basically has no real competition.

So that's the story. The audio web has come together and many people  didn't even know it. On top of that, I predict that Google (or some competitor)  will use its strength and intelligence to make the audio web available to everyone.  Google Audio Search will become a reality because audio information is becoming a true internet asset, and when assets are unclassified there is a  search void. Google will fill the audio search void, and make a lot of money. You heard it first right here, right now.

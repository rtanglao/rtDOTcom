Using a borrowed <a href="http://www.gpscentral.ca/products/tomtom/bluetoothgps.htm">Tom Tom Navigator 6 GPS</a> from <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100115/">Cyprien</a> (thanks!), I did a little outdoor GeoWalk from Bryght at 1 Alexander to the <a href="http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/home.cfm">Vancouver Art Gallery</a>, I took <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157594559097665/">29 photos</a> with my Nokia N80i. Only roughly 50%, <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/404183088/in/set-72157594559097665/">15</a> out of 29 were geotagged, shouldn't that number be 100% or closer to it?

<p>
Is this a S60, N80i, ShoZu, or Tom Tom bug? Suggestions to make this closer to 100% gratefully received.

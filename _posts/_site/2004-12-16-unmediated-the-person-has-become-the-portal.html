<p>What Howard said! And of course blogs (text, audio and video) are and will be a key expression of a person and their cyberspace portal.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.unmediated.org/archives/2004/12/the_person_has.php">unmediated: The person has become the portal</a>. via <a href="http://www.downes.ca/edu_rss.htm">Edu_RSS</a>:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>"Changes in the nature of computer-mediated communication both reflect and foster the development of networked individualism in networked societies. Internet and mobile phone connectivity is to persons and not to jacked-in telephones that ring in a fixed place for anyone in the room or house to pick up. The developing personalization, wireless portability and ubiquitous connectivity of the Internet all facilitate networked individualism as the basis of community. Because connections are to people and not to places, the technology affords shifting of work and community ties from linking people-in-places to linking people at any place. Computer-supported communication is everywhere, but it is situated nowhere. It is I-alone that is reachable wherever I am: at a home, hotel, office, highway or shopping center. The person has become the portal.</p>

<p>This shift facilitates personal communities that supply the essentials of community separately to each individual: support, sociability, information, social identities and a sense of belonging. The person, rather than the household or group, is the primary unit of connectivity. Just as 24/7/365 Internet computing means the ready availability of people in specific places, the proliferation of mobile phones and wireless computing increasingly is coming to mean an even greater availability of people without regard to place. Supportive convoys travel ethereally with each person."</p></blockquote>

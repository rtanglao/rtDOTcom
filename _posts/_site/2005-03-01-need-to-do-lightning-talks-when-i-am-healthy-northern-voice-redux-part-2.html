<p>Notes to self for future lightning talks:
</p>
<ul><li>Don't get too close to the microphone. Will I ever learn this? I made the same mistake at BloggerCon III and BlogTalk! Arrgh! You think I'd learn after <a href="http://dogmaradio.com/node/7">my</a> <a href="http://dogmaradio.com/node/6">three</a> <a href="http://dogmaradio.com/dr/lady-in-the-lake-black-tories">podcasts</a> :-) !
</li><li>Be healthy. Don't have a cold.</li>
<li>Eat protein and more chocolate beforehand. Heh!
</li><li>Use a mouse. Trackpads don't cut it for rapid demos.</li>
<li>Don't use Safari when demoing something that uses Flash like Flickr. Firefox's flash works better on the Mac.</li></ul>

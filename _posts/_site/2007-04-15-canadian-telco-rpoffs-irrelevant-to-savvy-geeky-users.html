<p> If you are a savvy user who doesn&#39;t mind enduring the occasional yak shaving geekery of configuring and using today&#39;s Voice 2.0 products, then Canadian telecom oligopolies and r*poff prices and indeed world wide telecoms r*poffs are largely irrelevant as Andy points out.  All you need is  an internet connection and for extra bonus fun and flexibility, WiFi and  a device like an N800 or a mobile phone with a SIP client. The real revolution in Voice 2.0 will occur when this kind of flexibility and power  is available to all not just folks like <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy</a> and myself and the people who read this blog. <br />  <br />FROM <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/2007/04/price_breaks_in.html">VoIP Watch: Price Breaks In Canada Won&#39;t Happen Yet</a>: </p>

<blockquote> Mark Evans points to a Globe and Mail article about why our friends to the North won&#39;t see the kind of price wars we see in the USA. <br /> <br />I beg to differ as we have enterered the era of global telephony carriers, where as a result of IP boundaries no longer exist. For years when I traveled internationally I had to use callback systems, now for the time I&#39;ve been working out of the country I&#39;ve made likely less than 20 calls on my International calling card or direct calls from my cell phone. Almost all my calls have been via Truphone, GizmoProject, Skype, SightSpeed or GoogleTalk via the Nokia N800. GrandCentral has handled where the calls end up. I could have also used services like Jajah, Rebtel, Mint Telecom and others too. We&#39;re way beyond local numbers being portable between local carriers and mobile operators. We&#39;re at a point where numbers start in one place, end in another and appear to be where they seem to be but really aren&#39;t. </blockquote>

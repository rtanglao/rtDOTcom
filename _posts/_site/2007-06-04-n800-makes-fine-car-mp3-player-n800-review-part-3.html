The N800 makes a fine car MP3 player. Unfortunately my naive drag and drop of 500MB of music didn't work (could only fit about 100MB of music in a single directory even though I have over 3GB free on my two 2GB cards). I guess I'll have to do some googling and asking around. Hopefully I can get it to auto-sync with Mac iTunes via a plugin!

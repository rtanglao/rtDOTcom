<p>More N95-1 observations:</p>
<ol>   <li>shutter lag is less, still too much lag in general (sensor turn on lag, focus lag and shutter lag)</li>    <li>I seem to get more out of memory errors on the web browser than the N93 browser</li>    <li>Video stabilization like the video stabilization on the N93 doesn&#39;t seem to do much</li>    <li>I prefer the larger keys on the N93, but love the N95 compact form factor</li>    <li>Assuming the doubled free RAM on the N95-3 allows you to run ShoZu, Twitter in the web browser and the Jaiku mobile client simultaneously without crashing, <a href="http://www.atmasphere.net/wp/archives/2007/10/05/nokia-delivers-with-the-us-nokia-n95">the N95-3 looks to be a killer device</a>. for mobile multi-media creators like myself. I can&#39;t recommend the N95-1 but based on the early reviews for the N95-3, I can definitely recommend the N95-3; too bad Nokia isn&#39;t giving N95-1 North American owners a rebate like Apple did for iPhone early adopters</li> </ol>

<p>Aaargh! Looks like it is b*rked. I get error E50 and only 3MB instead of 1GB and my Canon S400 displays "Memory Card Error" when I turn it on. I have taken over 20, 000 digital camera photos (over 10, 000 on compact flash and about 10, 000 on SmartMedia) and never had a problem and this card is only 4 months old. I guess I need to find my old 256 MB card. Help!</p>

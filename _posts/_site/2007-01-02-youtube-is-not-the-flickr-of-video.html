<p>I guess it depends on what you mean by "flickr of video". For me (and I wasn't clear of course :-) !) it means innovation, the flickr API and that "wabi sabi" that the flickr team and community has that none of the video sharing services have including YouTube.</p>

<p>All YouTube did well was their flash interface to video.

<p>In my opinion, YouTube is the "Yahoo photos of video" not the flickr of video. No disrespect to the team at YouTube intended! What the YouTube did was amazing but it doesn't compare to what flickr did. YMMV, etc!</p>

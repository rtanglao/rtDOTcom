<p>
I tried to use the trial version of<a href="http://www.kablog.org/"> Kablog</a> 2.10  to blog photos from my 7610 to this blog (rolandtanglao.com) and to my Blogware blog at <a href="http://roland.blogware.com/">roland.blogware.com</a> but it doesn't work, I get <a href="http://www.kablog.org/projects/kablog/archives/000321.html">error 899 which apparently means timeout</a>.  The <a href="http://www.kablog.org/projects/kablog/archives/000300.html">install instructions</a> vaguely mention an unlock code but I couldn't find it anywhere including the Yahoo mailing list.
</p>
<p>
This is weird because it's not the server end and it's not the phone since I can successfully use the MovableType  MetaWeblog extensions to post blog posts with photos to both rolandtanglao.com and roland.blogware.com  using ecto on my Mac and <a href="http://www.picoblogger.com/">Picoblogger</a> on my 7610.

<p>
I will follow up with the Kablog people but if you have any clues on how to make it work, please leave a comment.

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Here is some gospel: if you can't do it simply, with a simple text-editor, a web server and a standard browser, it's broken.

...

More gospel: if you can't say what you want to say with it, it's broken.

...

A Third Gospel: if you can't link, it's broken.

...

A Fourth Gospel: if you can't find it, it doesn't exist.

<blockquote><p>We were cooking it a bit on the background, but I guess it's time: BlogWalkSeattle is planned for 2 September and I'm very glad that Nancy White joins for facilitating it.

<p>This time the theme is (un)conference? blogging?
</p>
<p>We are going to focus on parallels, differences and synergies between blogging and face-to-face gatherings.</p></blockquote>

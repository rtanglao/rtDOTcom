<blockquote> Fortunately Carrypad has all the gory details on the new Internet Tablet, which sports a 4.1-inch, 800x480 pixel touch screen, a 320MHz processor, 128MB of RAM, 256MB of Flash ROM, dual SD memory card slots, 802.11b/g WiFi, a built-in camera (they don&#39;t specify resolution), and Bluetooth 2.0. Apparently CompUSA, which carried the original Nokia 770, already has &#39;em for sale in some stores. </blockquote>

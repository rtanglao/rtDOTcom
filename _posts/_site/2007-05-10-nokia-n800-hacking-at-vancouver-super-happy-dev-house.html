Anybody up for some impromptu Nokia N800 hacking at the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/05/08/vancouver-super-happy-dev-house-at-bryght-sponsored-by-socialtext">Vancouver Super Happy Dev House</a> on Friday? I am in as long as:
<br /> i) it's less than a 1000 lines of code; I am an old man and can't keep more than 1000 lines in my head at once :-) 
<br />ii) we use a dynamic language like PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc. Sorry I am done with C++, Java, C# etc and refuse to program in them ever again!

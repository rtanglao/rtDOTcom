<p>Now that my N95 is SIM-less, everytime I try to upload photos with ShoZu or use the WiFi on the phone in general, I get the useless S60 &quot;Create WLAN connection in offline mode?&quot; message. Nokia: this message has got to go please! If I say yes to this once, then remember it forever (cf. the iPhone which does this properly). ShoZu feature request: please work around this useless S60 &quot;feature&quot;.</p>

The KRZR works great as a modem for the Nokia N800. Glad I finally found something the KRZR is good for :-). (For me personally, the KRZR K1 just doesn't work since the KRZR I have from Rogers is both closed and locked so there is no easy way to get videos and photos onto online services like flickr unless you enjoy the USB and Bluetooth chain of pain which I don't. Bluetooth and USB cut it for those who take one photo a day. I unfortunately take much more than that!)

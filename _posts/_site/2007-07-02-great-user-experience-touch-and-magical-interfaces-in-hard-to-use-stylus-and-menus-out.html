<p> The iPhone has launched and despite all the doubters by and large works and is a success (at least in the USA).  This is the future for the entire computer industry not just mobile devices. Touch and magical interfaces are in. Interfaces using a stylus and menus are out. And above all<a href="http://www.cenriqueortiz.com/weblog/Mobility/2007/03/10/The-future-of-handset-design-from-hardware-to-software.html"> user experience is the driving force</a> for selling anything with software from June 29, 2007 on.

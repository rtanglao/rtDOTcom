Just listened to some inspirational talk and music on <a href="http://www.byte.org/_attachments/172506/random-bytes-radio-10-31-2004.mp3">Ross Rader's latest podcast</a> (45 MB MP3 file).  As usual, he is 100% right.  Everybody should be able to share what they want (text, video, audio, whatever) with whoever they want, whenever they want unconstrained by bandwidth (other than paying a nominal fair fee).  This will come to pass and podcasts are just the beginning and the harbinger of this coming wave!

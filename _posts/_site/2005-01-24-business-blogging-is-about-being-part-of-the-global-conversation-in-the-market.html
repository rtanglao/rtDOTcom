<p>From <a href="http://blog.redherring.com/MT/archives/main/000535.html?t=thenow">Red Herring Blog: How to make a business of passion</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>In a global conversation, your customers are not only being satisfied or dissatisfied, they are talking about their experience. The reason to operate a blog in support of your business is that if you aren't involved in that conversation you are both deaf and dumb in the market.</p>

<p>That's a hard message for many to hear, especially those marketers who believe that their work turns mostly on the placement of massive investments on a conceptual chessboard. The blogger to some degree becomes part of the story of a product or service, supplanting the traditionally clean image of the company with a more human one, a face that people can praise and attack. It's hand-selling in the same sense that retailers strive for, where an individual's passion for a product (a book, a piece of software, or a car) is translated into a sale because of a conversation in the store or showroom.</p> </blockquote>

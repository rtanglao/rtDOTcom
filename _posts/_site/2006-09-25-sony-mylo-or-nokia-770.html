<p> The <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/mylo/prod/index.html">Mylo</a> looks sweet, but I doubt I will ever get one because it&#39;s Sony (which means it&#39;s proprietary in the wrong ways; I don&#39;t like Memory Sticks for example or the proprietary movie media format on the PSP) and I want the openness and hackability of Linux and I want Jabber. All of which the Nokia 770 does better it would appear. </p>

<blockquote> My first impression -- this may be for Sony in this decade what the Walkman was for them in the 1980&#39;s. Web access, photos, videos, WiFi connectivity, media player -- they were all there in a device smaller than the original Walkman. </blockquote>

<p>As I have said before, <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=site%3Arolandtanglao.com+emacs&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">there is only one editor and it's emacs</a> I've tried to shake the Emacs addiction but I can't. It's scary to think I've used Emacs for 15 years and vi for over 20!

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>OS X has been with us for a few years now, and Emacs has been coming along slowly and surely. We must have hit some sort of a tipping point, and there are a whole lot of people working on the problem; the result is that life is getting better and better for the Emacs tribe. This piece opens with a brief sermon on why, if you%u2019re not already using Emacs, you might want to check it out; and then surveys the state of play and the multiple interesting emacses that are out there.</blockquote>

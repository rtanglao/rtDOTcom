<p>Yes! I took <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157603306140566/">41 photos</a> in about 30 minutes with the N95-1 with V 20.0.0.015 firmware and the N95-1 appeared to pass the <a href="http://mobilereportcard.com/task/roland-shozu-challenge-publishing-lots-photos-flickr-shozu-until-s60-crashes#comment-1">Roland Shozu Challenge</a> i.e. the phone didn&#39;t crash, the camera app didn&#39;t crash and ShoZu uploaded the photos to flickr and didn&#39;t crash (this was with a freshly upgraded N95-1 with only ShoZu installed. Go Nokia go!</p>
<p>Hmm should I tempt fate and install another app like Jaiku?</p>

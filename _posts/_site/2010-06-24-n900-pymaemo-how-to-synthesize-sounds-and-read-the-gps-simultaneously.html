<p>Just for fun, I am writing a little <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/PyMaemo">PyMaemo</a> python script (sorry but I don't do C++ anymore so that's out :-) !) to compute and then play sounds based on my GPS coordinates (using the <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/PyMaemo/Using_Location_API">N900 Python Location API</a>).</p>
<p>The easiest way to synthesize (rather than just play sounds) seems to be to use the PyGame sound synth (e.g. <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nvawter/otherProduct/">keyboard5.py from MIT computes some nice sounds)</a> but I don't know how to make it work with the PyMaeMo GPS loop.</p>
<p>LazyWeb, anybody have some sample Python code :-) ? I of course will do my homework and post on the official very hard to follow forum (should I ask in <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/">talk.maemo.org </a>OR the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/mailman/listinfo/pymaemo-developers">pymaemo</a> list?) , but any help would be much appreciated.</p>

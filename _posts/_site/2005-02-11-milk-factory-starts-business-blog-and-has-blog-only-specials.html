<p>Great idea from Vancouver's <a href="http://www.milkfactory.com/">Milk Factory</a> (love their slogan "Survival Gear for Families").  You are going to see more businesses using their blogs for special marketing offers like this. Disclosure: I have met (through my blog naturally) the fine folks at Milk Factory and have given them some advice on blogging!.</p>

<blockquote>About the weblog editor, here's the deal:

It's being overhauled, top-to-bottom, for the next release of NetNewsWire. It
will be quite different from the current weblog editor.

The goals are:

1. To make it easier to use *and* more powerful. The user interface has been
completely re-designed.

2. To support more weblog features than are currently supported. (Things like
Movable Type keywords.)

3. To make it a better text/HTML editor.

4. To fix a bunch of bugs.

5. To make it scriptable.

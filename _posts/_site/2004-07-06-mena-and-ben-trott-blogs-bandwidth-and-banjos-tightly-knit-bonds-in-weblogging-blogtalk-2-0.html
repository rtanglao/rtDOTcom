<p>Diarists versus Pundits</p>

<p>Mena is somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Mena posted about how Ben was a “tyrant” because he wouldn’t “let” her buy a banjo.</p>

<p>Got “I hate you” email. Why where this people in her life? People misjudged her.</p>

<p>Became famous and “popular” because of this post.</p>

<p>Blogs are about communication. Became popular when interactivity (e.g. comments) became available.</p>

<p>Everyone will have a weblog.</p>

<p>Weblogs of the future will be generations removed from the sites that shaped the medium.</p>

<p>Push from publishing into communication.</p>

<p>TypePad - for friends and families of MT - original design goal
                 - for people who wanted to communicate</p>

<p>It’s not about publishing and reaching a large audience.  Majority of people want to reach a much smaller audience. 10-20, not 10,000-2000</p>

<p>When TypePad was launched, Mena was a bit dismayed.</p>

<p>Ideal audience was family and friends but not on recently updated list (because they were private!). No pinging, no spidering by Google.</p>

<p>33% of TypePad blogs are private (no pinging)</p>

<p>10% are password protected.</p>

<p>These blogs exist for those who are intended to see them.  Talk about soccer games, etc.</p>

<p>You put blogs on line because they are persistent and asynch,</p>

<p>Because it’s asynch it’s friendly in terms of personal bandwidth. You can choose when to update and read it.</p>

<p>Why blogs help communication?
- Email spam out of control
- blogs are persistent, archived, more flexible in privacy controls, more scalable for personal bandwidth</p>

<p>Blogs work well with email. e.g. through NewsGator</p>

<p>For some high-ranking managers, a blog feed is just a “special email” that the recieve once a day through NewsGator.  No one here thinks what they do here is blogging, just receiving and sending email,</p>

<p>Blogging becomes ubiquitous when it blends in and becomes invisible.</p>

<p>Tools need to evolve.</p>

<p>Need something more fine-grained than password protection so Mena can write something important about her company AND her Back to the Future collectibles.</p>

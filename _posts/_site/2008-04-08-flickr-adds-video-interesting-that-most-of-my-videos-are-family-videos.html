<p><a href="http://blog.flickr.net/en/2008/04/09/video-on-flickr-2/">Flickr finally added video today</a>.Yay! Only 90 seconds and 150MB per video (and requires a pro account to upload videos) but you can tag, geo-tag, add videos to sets and use the flickr privacy system (and there will be a video upload API, yes!). Other than taking videos at conferences and events like <a href="http://blip.tv/posts/?topic_name=democampvancouver">DemoCamp</a> and <a href="http://blip.tv/posts/?topic_name=mobilemonday">Mobile Monday</a>, I really use video for family stuff which is on my private family flickr account (for those of you who care about <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/">my public flickr account</a>, don&#39;t worry, i will soon have many videos of me bicycling through Vancouver :-)Â  to join my 36000 and counting photos!). So having flickr support video will be a great way to share videos via flickr&#39;s guess pass to my non-flickr-using family. Now if only you had access to the original video, flickr video would be complete! Feature request to the ShoZu folks: support upload to flickr once the API comes out and support the full 150MB over 3G and WiFi!</p>

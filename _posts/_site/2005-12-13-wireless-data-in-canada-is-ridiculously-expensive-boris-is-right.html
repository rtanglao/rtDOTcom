<p><strong>LATER</strong>: The $50 a month unlimited data plan is no longer available to new Fido subscribers. I am &quot;grandfathered&quot;. So unlucky new users will get r*pped off! This is really bad and doesn't encourage mobile data at all!<br /></p>
<p>My data traffic from my last Fido bill was 89 Megabytes (of cameraphone pictures uploaded to flickr using the fantatic flickr uploader <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">Shozu</a>) which means that if I didn't have the $50 a month flat rate plan, I would be paying $30/MB * 89 = $2670 (this can't be right, it can't be this much of a r*poff, somebody leave me a comment and say it ain't so!) ! Until we have real competition in Canada (which is not in the cards thanks to the moribund CRTC; the next mobile phone I buy with my own money, like Boris, will use WiFi to route around this damage!), I can't see wireless data services taking off here. I laugh every time I see one of the Canadian TV phone ads and picture the sad day when one of these TV phone customers gets their bill. Hah! Even cameraphones are a r*poff here in Canada!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Mentioning his on the road week at Les Blogs, Paolo Valdemarin reports that 3G access with his phone costs 0,75 eurocent/kb = 7,6 Euros per Mb. </p> <p>I would happily pay that price, especially for the approximately 300kbps speed of 3G. How much does wireless cost in Canada? Well, only Fido/Rogers have GPRS, while Bell and Telus have the ridiculous 1X no SIM card lock in nonsense. If you don't have a data plan, GPRS costs $30 CDN / MB, or 30 cents/kb. So, uploading one picture from my 1.3MP cameraphone costs about $9. Ridiculous!</p></blockquote>

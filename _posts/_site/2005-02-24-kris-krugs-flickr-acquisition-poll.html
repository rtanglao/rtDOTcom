<p>A fun <a href="http://www.kriskrug.com/2005/02/flickr-acquisition-poll.html">poll</a>. I don't care who buys Flickr as long as all of the Flickr crew get lots of $ and they don't break my URLs or do anything e*il to my photos!

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>The rumors of a Flickr buyout by Yahoo are flying all over the net. Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake posted today at Flickr central what sounds like a denial. Whether or not there is a deal signed at the moment, I'm guessing that it is just a matter of time before one of the big guys snaps up this startup. I mean, Flickr is the hottest thing on the web right now. Stewart has told me they've turned down some offers already.</blockquote>

<p>Very handy when you are going into a meeting. Hold down the "#" key to toggle between Silent and General (now if only you could specify which states it toggles between, I would prefer Pager which I lovingly refer to as pleasure mode :) ! and General rather than Silent and General). This feature is a series 60 feature, so it's probably not new to the N70 but very nice nonetheless.</p>

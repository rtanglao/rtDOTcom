<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>   <p>1. <b>Fabulous Flickr Fun</b> - Flickr users and people who can code aka software developers party together and brainstorm to come up with 2 do-able remixes of Flickr and maybe even a plan to design and implement them.</p>
<p>   2. <b>Banana Rap</b> - Banana means Asian (usually Chinese) on the outside and Canadian i.e. white on the inside. Thesis: all Canadians are bananas because we all have multiple identities (at least 2: Canadian + American) - We should revel in this and not  fear it. In this session, we'll talk about how multiple identities influence blogging and perhaps give Canadians different perspectives than Americans who blog.</p>

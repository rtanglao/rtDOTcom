<p>This is very cool, but how do they make money? Ads?  And why doesnâ€™t it work with non Blogger blogs? Every other tool like <a href="http://www.audioblog.com/">AudioBlog</a> uses the MetaWeblog API and therefore works with <a href="http://blog.blogware.com/blog">Blogware</a>, <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MT</a> and all the other MetaWeblogAPI tools.  Time to sign up for a free Blogger blog to play with this.</p>

How much is it?

Audioblogger is offering a FREE...ya, no money, zip, nada...

What will the audio look like on my blog?

There will be a link to your audioblogger post, an associated icon, and a time stamp. You will soon be able to choose the icon that you would like posted on your site, but for now your choices are limited.</blockquote>

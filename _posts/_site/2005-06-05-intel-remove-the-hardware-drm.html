<p>Lose the hardware DRM, Intel. How to develop hardware and software, not!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.digitmag.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=4915">Digit Online news - Intel quietly adds DRM to new chips</a>. (via <a href="http://www.jluster.org/2005/06/apple-on-monday-bliss-or-bust/">Jonas Luster</a>):</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Intel's reticence to speak publicly about what lies under the hood of its latest firmware technology has also prompted calls to come clean from IT security experts, including Queensland University of Technology's assistant dean for strategy and innovation, IT faculty, Bill Caelli.</p>

<p>"It's a dual use technology. It's got uses and misuses. Intel has to answer what guarantees it is prepared to give that home users are safe from hackers. Not maybes, guarantees".
</p>
<p>Caelli said it was "critical Intel comes clean" about how the current DRM technology is embedded into the new CPU and chipset offering.

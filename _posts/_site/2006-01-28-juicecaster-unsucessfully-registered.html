<p>On <a href="http://www.juicecaster.com/J">JuiceCaster</a>, I successfully (well at least there was no error message) registered as 'roland' and then when I tried to get it to send me an SMS to reset my password, it complained that 'roland' is too short and that it needs to be 7 characters or more and less than 16. Beta bug I bet! Somebody please let me know when this works in Canada (I put in a fake zip code of 90210 and just entered my Canadian Fido number and JuiceCaster erroneously accepted it). Next! </p>

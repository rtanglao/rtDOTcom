* I asked this in slack and received the following responses:
  * "covid-19 vs cabin fever ![:thinking_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/google-medium/1f914@2x.png)"
  * "cabin fever-19?"
  * "It’s like FOMO but you’re not actually missing anything because we’re all at home too?"
  * "extrovert? ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/10.2/google-medium/1f642@2x.png)"
  * "corona’d?"

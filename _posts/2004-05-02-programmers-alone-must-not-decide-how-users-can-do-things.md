Amen! Great software is developed by somebody (or some time)  with taste who either involves the user early or understands what real users want.

From <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/04/27.html#a984">Jon Udell: Radical software customization</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>We can all agree that software must be customizable. But when programmers alone decide how users can do things, you often end up with a scenario like Aunt Tillie's OS X adventure: a dashboard packed with incomprehensible dials and knobs. If the dashboard was built with a dynamic language, the programmer can at least rearrange the controls more quickly and more easily. But the rules engines that James Owen has been writing about, and the FIT framework that Ward Cunningham has created, point toward a radically altered relationship between software makers and software users. It can't happen too soon.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

## QUOTE:

>I like to make tiny websites. My requirements for my sites are something like:

>* I have maybe 20 websites (mostly static but not all)
>* I want to spend basically 0 time maintaining them, maybe 5 minutes every 2 months at most
>* I need to be able to ignore a project for 3 years and then come back and be able to develop it easily

>here are some of the ways I choose tools to keep my sites running without doing a lot of maintenance. this is a draft, might clean it up and make it into a real post later

* Perhaps I should have stayed on the previous build :-) ?!!? ```\\wsl$\Ubuntu``` seems to work fine on my Surface Book 2 running the intel build 1903.
* Haven't been able to find the same issue on github but  [P9 Explorer Integration not working #4027](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4027)  appears closest although I have the P9 DLL and the correct P9 registry keys!

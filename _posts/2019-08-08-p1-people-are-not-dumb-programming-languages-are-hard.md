* Read  the whole thing from the Computing Education Research Blog:[Task-specific programming languages: People aren’t dumb. Programming is hard.](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/task-specific-programming-languages-past-guzdial-is-smarter-than-present-guzdial/):  "People aren’t dumb. Programming languages are hard.  If we can fix that, we should. That’s what I see task-specific programming as being about."
* I think we've tried this before but it's time to try again. And learn from Matlab, R, Logo, Hypercard, spreadsheets etc
* Anybody should be able to express what they want and create a crude software tool to do it and then hand it off to others for refinement and user experience improvement if need be.  I bet more than 50% of the time the crude software tool created by normal folks would be super useful at least as a working prototype.
* Via Knowing and Doing::Eugene Wallingford::[Encountering an Old Idea Three Times in Ten Days](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2019-08.html#e2019-08-08T14_42_55.htm) which has this great quote: "There was a need for a keyboard thirty years before anyone designed a standard typing interface, so telegraphers adapted an existing tool to fit their needs. What if we are in that same thirty-year gap in the design of programming
  languages? "

* To generate a haiku with map  based on where you are, [click on this link and then tap on "Locate me!"](https://satellitestud.io/osm-haiku/app/#14/40.7237/-73.9819)
* And then take a screenshot and post to wherever :-)
* The announcement: ([OpenStreetMap Haiku: Using OSM and Overpass  for generative poetry](https://satellitestud.io/blog/post/openstreetmap-haiku/) )from the developers, Satellite Studio, is delightful and informative about the Overpass API for OSM
* Found via flowing data: [Haikus generated based on your map location and OpenStreetMap data](https://flowingdata.com/2019/12/12/haikus-generated-based-on-your-map-location/)

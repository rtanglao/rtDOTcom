## Pontifications

Too many choices!
* my favourite: [Sparklines in ggplot2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35434760/sparklines-in-ggplot2)
* [Combining data tables and sparklines](https://leonawicz.github.io/HtmlWidgetExamples/ex_dt_sparkline.html) <---- htmlwidget hacks! nice compact format, could be used to summarize firefox desktop metrics: 
  * os, keywords, sentiment, language
* [jQuery Sparkline HTML Widget for R](https://github.com/htmlwidgets/sparkline)
* [microplot: Microplots (Sparklines) in 'LaTeX', 'Word', 'HTML', 'Excel'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microplot/index.html) <--- not really designed for ggplot2
  * further tutorial: [R Microplots in Tables with the latex() Function](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/microplot/vignettes/rmhPoster.pdf)

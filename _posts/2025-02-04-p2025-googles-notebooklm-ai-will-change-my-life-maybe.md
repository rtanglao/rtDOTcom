## QUOTE:

* Read the whole thing
>I’d like to ask my personal AI chatbot things like “How might I recast two book proposals I’ve written that didn’t sell?” Or  “Show me the notes and transcripts of interviews I did for a Google story I wrote in 2002.” Or “Generate the names and latest email addresses, sorted by story, of every person I’ve quoted in anything I’ve written. What did they say in those stories? Or “Describe my method for writing and reporting stories for a journalism school class. Or “Show me videos I took of my kids before they turned five.”

>We’re not there yet. But Google’s NotebookLM is close. I used it for this piece, uploading a 75 minute interview I did with its editorial director, Steven Johnson. I’d guess it reduced the story production time by 25 percent.  I asked it to write a 1000 word story and a 2000 word edited Q&A based on the interview. Neither were bad first drafts. And they helped me draft this version much faster.

It appears nobody in Vancouver uses Nokia phones and ShoZu even though it's FANTASTIC because nobody has taken me up on my<a href="/archives/2008/12/01/almost-free-shozu-help-vancouverites-helping-shozu-mir-campaign"> free ShoZu help in exchange for coffee</a> offer. Bloodied :-) (ok, not really!)  I am but undaunted as well, here's another offer: Free photo GPS tagging tutorials using <a href="http://www.nseries.com/nseries/vine/">Nokia ViNe</a> and <a href="http://sportstracker.nokia.com/">Nokia Sports Tracker</a> and Nokia phones in exchange for coffee. Interested? Email roland AT rolandtanglao.com or text me: 604 729 7924 or twitter rtanglao

	An avid cyclist, Tanglao takes photos during his rides and has more
	than 44,000 photos on Flickr, a great many of them geotagged. Recently,
	he’s been taking pictures with a Nokia N95, a smartphone with a
	five-megapixel camera whose image quality rivals that of some basic
	stand-alone digital cameras. With a built-in global-positioning-system
	receiver, the N95 automatically tags photos with geographic data

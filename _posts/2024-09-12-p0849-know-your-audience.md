Usually at least 2! --> **QUOTE**: `Nearly every engineering project will have at least two different audiences for their documentation. ... At least two audiences. Probably three or four. Maybe more. ... 4. People using the product built on the codebase ... What this group wants to know is simple: can it solve their problem? As an engineer, you offload these conversations to another department at your peril: You know better than they do what your code can and can't do, so you are better equipped to take at least the first pass at documenting it. .. Talk about the benefits with honesty and without hype. Someone will inevitably add additional hype downstream of your efforts. Before it gets there, though, you can have a real conversation about why you created the thing you created, who you created it for, and what it can do to make their lives better. The how is for another audience.`

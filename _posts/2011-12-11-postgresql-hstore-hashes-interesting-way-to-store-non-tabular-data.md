<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html">Hstore</a> as expained in <a class="Title" href="http://blog.creapptives.com/post/14062057061/the-key-value-store-everyone-ignored-postgresql">Ecstortive:The key value store everyone ignored (Postgresql)</a> is an interesting non NO SQL way to store key value pairs. I wonder if it's faster than doing the same thing in Redis or MongoDB. My uninformed guess is yes :-) !</p>

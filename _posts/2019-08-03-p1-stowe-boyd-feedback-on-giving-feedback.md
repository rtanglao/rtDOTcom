# Pontifications

* Read  the whole thing (subject to Medium's ridiculous paywall :-) #ymmv ): [Stowe Body Some Feedback About Feedback](https://medium.com/work-futures/some-feedback-about-feedback-be02d84dd903)
* I especially like these table entries:
  * **Here are three things that really worked for me. What was going through your mind when you did them?** Instead of "Good Job"!
  * **Here's what I would do**. Instead of "Here's what you should do"
  * **When you did x, I felt y or I didn't get that.** Instead of "That didn't really work."
  * **Here's exactly where you started to lose me.** Instead of "You need to improve your communications skills"
  * **I'm struggling to understand your plan**. Instead of "You lack strategic thinking"
  * **When I don't hear from you, I worry that we're not on the same page.** Instead of "You need to be more responsive"
  * **Here's my reaction.** Instead of "Can I give you some feedback?"

title: Numbers crashed with a 240000 line csv file
---

Apple's numbers app crashed with a [240000 line csv file of the top colours from Vancouver instagram 2014 photos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtanglao/rtgram/gh-pages/IG-VANCOUVER_2014/RENUMBERED/TOP10/TOPCOLOUR/topcolour-ig-vancouver-2014.csv) and then crashed my MacBook Air 13 inch retina. Wow!
Haven't see that in years. Apparently [some sort of bug in 10.10.3](http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/04/16/os-x-10103-triggering-kernel-panics-when-previewing-jpeg-files)?!?

Off to R Studio!

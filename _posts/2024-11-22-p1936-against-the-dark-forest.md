[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Nov 22, 2024 19:36 [Erin Kissane: against the dark forest](https://www.wrecka.ge/against-the-dark-forest/) <-- Read The Whole Thing :-) --> **QUOTE**: `And most of all: The social internet should be a forestâ€”not The Dark Forest, but something much more like a real one: Interconnected from the densely mycelial underground to light-filtering overstory but also offering infinite niches and multi-scale zones of sheltered exchange and play. Deeply human in the way that real forests are the result of human and other-than-human collaboration running back into unrecorded time. Balanced, neither extracting too much from its component organisms nor pretending that a pantomime of a return to a pristine and ungoverned state will solve any problems at all. (Predation is inevitable in any system, but a working ecosystem starves out the ones who overfeed and provides cover for growth and for the long, continuous experiment of evolutionary change.) ... The obstacles to these life-sustaining internet forests are fundamentally the same forces that threaten the real forests and our whole living world: unbounded extraction; unaccountable leadership; societal refusal to take on the responsibilities of governing our increasingly complex commons, instead of burying them deeper and deeper in pretenses to action. ...I no longer think that it's possible to mount an effective defense of the physical worldâ€”and of each other, in our fleshy vulnerabilityâ€”without unfðŸ‡ºcking our networks. I find this both terrifying and clarifying. `

<p>Interesting. I still think that S60 needs a drastic UI overhaul and simplification to compete with the iPhone long term and that Nokia would be better off with a Linux core for their mobile phones rather than Symbian and S60 but we&#39;ll see. Go Open Source S60 go! Does this mean both S60 and S40 will be 100% open source within 2 years? As the clich√© goes, the devil is in the details!</p>From <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nokia_acquires_symbian.php#more"><cite>Nokia Acquires Symbian; Takes on Google&#39;s Android - ReadWriteWeb</cite></a>:  <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   <p>Nokia isn&#39;t finished with its acquisition spree just yet. Tonight the Finnish company announced a plan to acquire the 52 per cent of Symbian it doesn&#39;t already own and make the platform open source</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p> <p>From <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/home/2008/06/nokia-to-acquir.html">The Symbian Press Release</a> :</p> <p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p> <blockquote>   <p>Contributions from Foundation members through open collaboration will be integrated to further enhance the platform. The Foundation will make selected components available as open source at launch. It will then work to establish the most complete mobile software offering available in open source. This will be made available over the next two years and is intended to be released under Eclipse Public License (EPL) 1.0.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

title: "Why We Hate Your Security Reports aka Why your support questions are not detailed enough and written clearly enough for us to fix the problem quickly together"

* [Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/) Jan 25, 2022. 20:51 [Why We Hate Your Security Reports](https://halfelf.org/2021/why-we-hate-your-security-reports/) <-- I think a better title is "Why your support questions are not detailed enough and written clearly enough for us to fix the problem quickly together"   because this applies to support questions  just as much as security reports.

<p><strong>Manual Support Forum browsing is soooo 1990s and a waste of support folks' time</strong> aka <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/momogs">my Get Satisfaction Thunderbird API ruby and Mongo DB side project</a> finally has born fruit :-) ! Seriously if you are manually searching your support forums and don't have <strong>customized support querying and reporting</strong>&nbsp; so <strong>vital, can't miss stuff</strong> comes to your support contributors via email (or some other semi-automated method like RSS or whatever) then you are doing support wrong.</p><p>I wrote a Ruby script to <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rtanglao/momogs/blob/master/mongoUpdateSlurpGS.rb" rel="nofollow">read via Get Satisfaction pseudo-REST API all the Thunderbird Support Topics into a MongoDB</a> and wrote <a class="external-link" href="https://github.com/rtanglao/momogs/blob/master/emailDailyMetrics.rb" rel="nofollow">a ruby script to generate&nbsp; a custom email support report</a>&nbsp; so cool, relevant, urgent stuff comes to me instead of me having to surf the forums.</p><p>Not only that I wrote <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/momogs/blob/master/bruteforceSearch.rb">a brute force search engine that allows searching the fulltext of all 40000 Get Satisfaction topics</a> and tags via regexes.</p><h2>Even cooler: Anybody who uses Get Satisfaction for support can use my code!!!!!!! All you have to do is:</h2><ol><li>change "mozilla_messaging" to your Get Satisfaction company name</li><li>change "mozilla_thunderbird" to your product name</li><li>configure a gmail account config file called email.conf with 3 lines:</li><ol><li>from_address</li><li>to_address</li><li>p for your password</li></ol></ol><p>Finally, here's the README which serves as the documentation</p><p>(since this is a side project, the README is shall we say lacking :-); I hope to somehow get this into the <a href="https://github.com/jsocol/kitsune">SUMO project</a> so that all support contributors not just me can use it; to this end I am writing a spec for this, fingers crossed)</p><h1>Roland's utilities for Get Satisfaction Metrics and other GS fun stuff</h1><ul><li>hardcoded for now for the Thunderbird product i.e. getsatisfaction.com/mozilla_message/products/thunderbird</li><li>easily hackable for any other product</li><li>forgive the barebones documentation for this project :-) !</li><li>HELP WANTED: would love for a real developer to fix this code and enhance it</li><li>email rtanglao AT mozilla.com if you are interested</li></ul><h1>Prerequisites:</h1><ul><li>requires a MongoDB running on local host with a database called "gs"</li><li>and with collection in the gs database called "topics"</li></ul><h1>Usage:</h1><h2>Update the Mongo - ALWAYS do this first before running anything else!</h2><pre><code>./mongoUpdateSlurpGS.rb 2011 6 16 2011 6 19 2&gt;mongoslurp.16-19june2011.818pm.stderr.txt &amp; </code></pre><h2>Daily email metrics (I run this twice a day, typically 9a.m. and 4p.m. Pacific)</h2><pre><code>./emailDailyMetrics.rb &amp; </code></pre><h2>Weekly Metrics to CSV files and stdout (run once a week to generate support metrics for the Thunderbird Project Call)</h2><pre><code>./weeklyMetrics.rb 2011 6 13 2011 6 19 2&gt;13-19june2011.stderr.txt 1&gt;13-19june2011.stdout.txt </code></pre><h2>Search the Thunderbird Get Satisfaction MongoDB for regexes in the fulltext (title+content+replies) &amp; tags</h2><p>e.g. for Thunderbird 5 here's a sample search ("-r" is a comma separated list of regexes to search the fulltext for and "-s" is a comma separated list of regexes to search tags for)</p><pre><code>./bruteforceSearch.rb 2011 6 1 2011 6 30 2&gt;19june2011.tb5b1.bfs.stderr.1020pm.txt 1&gt;19june2011.tb5b1.bfs.stdout.1020pm.txt -r tb5, "tb 5","thunderbird5","thunderbird 5",beta -s "tb 5",tb5,thunderbird5,"thunderbird 5","beta feedback",50,tb5,"tb 5",beta </code></pre>

*   Somewhat :-) relevant previous post from 2017: [Mel Robbins -- buffering: top 3 things/day 50%  more time; every 15 minutes of meetings, 5mins to process; create space  between you and people who deplete you; make 1 decision that will help  future you; consider dropping those things you wouldn't try to get  involved in if you weren't already doing them](http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/10/05/p1-mel-robbins-buffering-add-buffer-to-everything/)
*  Nov 20, 2020. [2018: Greg Wilson on Meetings](https://third-bit.com/2018/05/11/meetings.html). 
    *  agenda a day in advance
    *  timebox w/priorities,
    *  have a chair / "person in charge of the meeting" ,
    *  require politeness
    *  no technology
    *  no interruptions,
    *  record and publish minutes,
    *  everybody takes notes, 
    *  keep a backlog, 
    *  end early;
    *   interruption bingo for those (usually men !!!) who monopolize the discourse
*  Above ^^^ via  [2020:Management Skills](https://third-bit.com/2020/11/20/management-skills.html)  
    * "How to intervene when people behave badly
    * How to hold meetings
    * How to write a two-page memo making the case for doing something so that people have something concrete to debate (and so that there is a record later of why we did something).
    * How to set priorities and re-set them when the world changes or people fall behind. (The real purpose of a schedule is to tell you when to start cutting things from your planâ€¦)
    * Make things discoverable somehow"

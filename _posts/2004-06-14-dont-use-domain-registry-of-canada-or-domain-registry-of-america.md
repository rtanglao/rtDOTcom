All I can see about this  blog's outage from June 7th until June 14th  (which was due to my rolandtanglao.com domain name renewal procrastination and prolonged by other problems) is don't use <a href="http://droc.ca/">Domain Registry of Canada</a> or <a href="http://www.droa.com/">Domain Registry of America</a> for your domains.

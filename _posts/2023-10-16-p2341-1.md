[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 16, 2023. 23:41  [order questions by increasing id instead of decreasing id using +created #1](https://github.com/rtanglao/github-action-thunderbird-aaq/issues/1) `https://support.mozilla.org/api/2/question/?product=thunderbird&ordering=+created&created__gt=2023-10-15` seems to work??! i.e. questions are ascending order perhaps a problem with the quoting of '+created' <-- SOLVED: for ascending order just use `created` i.e. without the `+`, for descending order use `-created`

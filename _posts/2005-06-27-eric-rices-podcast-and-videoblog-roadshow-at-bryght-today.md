No worries, just bring yourself! Love to meet all the local Vancouver podcasters, videobloggers, and bloggers past present and future. We'll meet for a bit and then do an informal podwalk/videoblog walk/blogwalk and then have dinner and afterwards perhaps some surprises after dinner. It's totally casual so feel free to drop in for as long as you'd like for any part of the evening. Just RSVP to let us know when to expect you.</p></blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

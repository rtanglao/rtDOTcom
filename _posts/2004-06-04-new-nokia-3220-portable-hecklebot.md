This sounds like a fun feature!

From <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/06/01/will_airtexting_blackberry_become_the_mobile_hecklebot.html">Joi Ito's Web: Will airtexting BlackBerry become the mobile hecklebot?</a>:
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p><blockquote>If they made an airtexting enabled BlackBerry, I wonder if they would allow them in Congress. With the massive penetration of BlackBerries (NYT - A BlackBerry Throbs, and a Wonk Has a Date), it would be like a chorus of Hecklebots. Anyway, I want one. Forget night clubs, imaging having one in the audience during talks.</blockquote><p><strong>UNQUOTE</strong></p>

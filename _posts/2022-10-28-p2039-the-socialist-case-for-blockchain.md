[Discovered](http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/): Oct 28, 2022 20:39  [The Socialist Case for Blockchain](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2022/10/the-socialist-case-for-blockchain.html) <-- QUOTE: `And that's where the error lies in the Jacoban's argument. They want the science to reflect their own moral and political philosophies. But conversely, I believe that, ultimately, the making of good decisions leads to something like a socialist moral and political philosophy. Because I believe things like personal freedom and autonomy, social diversity and equity, etc.etc., makes for better decisions. But for me it isn't dogma. It doesn't begin with socialism. It ends with socialism.` <-- i agree. It ends with socialism!

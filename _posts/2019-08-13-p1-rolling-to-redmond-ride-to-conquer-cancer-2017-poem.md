* Just like [yesterday's Climbing to You](http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/08/12/p1-climbing-to-you-cypress-challenge/) I was inspired by the Ride to Cancer back in 2017 to write a poem entitled "Rolling to Redmond". Blogging it so I can find it outside of Facebook where I originally posted it back in September 2017!

## Rolling to Redmond

<pre>
Rolling for you Mom
Rolling for you Dad
Rolling for you Goong Goong
Rolling for you Sandie
Rolling because you can't beat us Emperor of Maladies
I'm rolling with you Ã‰va
I'm rolling with you Andy
I'm rolling with you yellow flag survivors
My heart is rolling
Rolling from Cloverdale
Rolling to Redmond
</pre>

An excellent passionate presentation from a non techie, non power user liberal arts person (!) who actually uses blogs in her Irish literature classes.

Some notes:
Everybody has something to offer.

Barbara engages and starts the community right away using a pre-course blog assignment.  It's open, connected and public.

Uses Levi's knowledge trees.

Hypertext links of blogs creates connective tissue between inside and outside classroom, studies.

Blogging becomes a catalyst for emergence.
 Barbara sets it up and gets out of the way quickly.

The plan is for students to learn more from their fellow students than the professor

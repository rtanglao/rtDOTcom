<ul>
  <li>Not how to program in Ruby, PHP, Perl, Julia, R, Lisp, Fortran, etc. etc.</li>
  <li>But instead what computers can and cannot do.</li>
  <li>And how to break problems into sub problems that computers can solve.</li>
  <li>This should involve some sort of computer language but not a procedural or Object Oriented one.</li>
  <li>The closest language to what I am thinking is probably something like <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-to-teach-computational-thinking-29e45c8a2664#.yhf57h7i4">Mathematicaâ€™s language</a> (not that I agree with everything written in this article!).</li>

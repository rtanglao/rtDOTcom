I"Í<p>tl;dr:Hindsight is 2020 :-) Funding + bandwidth + curation + live streaming with anchors &amp; field correspondents using mobile streaming = a true dynamic people's network which goes beyond merely static text, photo &amp; video blogging that we had in 2004 and 2006</p>
<p>I loved the grassroots coverage of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics from the folks at the True North Media House. But as always :-) I wanted more. If I had the time, energy, and budget (I am looking at you CBC, UBC, and the educational institutions and organizations with money and staff !) here's what I would have done:</p>
<ol><li>Found the funds to provide massive bandwidth to <a href="http://truenorthmediahouse.com/">True North Media House</a> to truly make it a place for the rest of us to get our stories out on the Internet</li><li>We are the network; we don't need to kowtow or reference the official VANOC sanctioned networks.</li><li>With adequate massive bandwidth the people can provide their own network. By network, I don't mean some text blogs with some photos and videos posted hours or minutes later. I mean, wouldn't it have been excellent to have:<br /><ol><li>Implemented a real live video network up 4-24 hours a day with rotating anchors from all the communities of the host cities (e.g. GBLTQ, Filipinos :-), East Van, South Van, every group in Metro Vancouver who has a voice!) merged (e.g. using CamTwist like software) with live mobile streaming video from mobile phones using Qik to get the local stories live as they happen on the ground) i.e. we don't need CNN, CBC etc.! With a studio with massive bandwidth and a few mobile phones with data plans and live streaming we can make a better grassroots, organic network !</li><li>Implemented some modern aggregation technology like <a href="http://managingnews.com/">Managing News</a> to aggregate social media and then getting local folks to curate and surface the local stories that others were missing or don't care about.</li></ol></li></ol>

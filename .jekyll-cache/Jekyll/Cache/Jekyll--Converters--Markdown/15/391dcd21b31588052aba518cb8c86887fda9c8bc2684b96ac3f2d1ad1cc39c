  <li>I realized I didnâ€™t write a Thanksgiving post back in October. This will probably be my last post of 2020.</li>
  <li>Looking back, I am very thankful to family, friends, supporters, funders and those who have helped out when I was in need.</li>
  <li>So lucky to have family, health, a roof over our heads and food.</li>
  <li>Letâ€™s continue to wear our masks, maintain 2 metre distance, stick to our bubbles and flatten the curve and get rid of COVID together in 2021.</li>

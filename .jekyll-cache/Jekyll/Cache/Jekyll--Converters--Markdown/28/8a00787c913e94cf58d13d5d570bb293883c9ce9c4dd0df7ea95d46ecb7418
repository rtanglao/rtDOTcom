  <p>In this comment, Iâ€™m just going to go over the method that they call elastic probing in the paper. The basic idea of this approach is to split the array into sub-arrays of descending size, and only care about two of the sub-arrays at a time. We keep working on the first two sub-arrays until the first is twice as full as the eventual fullness, and then move our window. By doing extra work in early insertions, later insertions are much easier.</p>

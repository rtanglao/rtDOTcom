Telcos set up as easily as WordPress and Drupal sites using software and hardware from projects like <a href="http://openbts.sourceforge.net/">OpenBTS</a>! Now this would be the end of &quot;telco business as usual&quot;. Go open go!

	2. Make a telco as simple to set up as a wordpress blog. Wireless meshes, least-cost-routing, etc. Letâ€™s make as much of that complexity disappear into default behaviours that can be tweaked as the owner/entrepreneur becomes more comfortable with the product.

	3. Be as open as possible. This is more of a philosophical than a practical constraint. We believe we can attract maximum participation by making software and hardware as open as possible. We believe that Open Hardware strategies devices like the Mesh Potato can change the way people think about hardware.

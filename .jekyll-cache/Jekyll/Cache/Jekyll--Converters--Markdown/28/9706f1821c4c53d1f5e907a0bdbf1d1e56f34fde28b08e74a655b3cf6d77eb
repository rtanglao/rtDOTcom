For example, 56% of Racially Minoritized developers report a negative judgment of the quality of AI outputs in coding work, compared with 28% for all developers, and report higher levels of AI Skill Threat. Women and LGBTQ+ people on software teams are less likely to report upskilling in AI-assisted coding, potentially signaling a lack of resources. It is vital to learn from these groups' insights as well as take action to ensure these gaps do not calcify into new, career-threatening barriers.</code></p>

  <li>Imagemagick aka magick version 7 even on a â€œslowâ€ ARM64 processor is much faster at cropping and montaging images (probably because itâ€™s in C/C++) than ruby solutions like VIPS and OilyPNG/ChunkyPNG. See <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/01/23/p1-did-you-get-catch-the-error-vips-code-yesterday-oilypng-twice-as-fast/">Did you catch the bug in yesterdayâ€™s vips code? Iâ€™ve coded an oily_png version that is at least twice as fast!</a></li>

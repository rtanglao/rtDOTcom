  <li>How did I miss this? Have to read Gina Apostol‚Äôs Bibliolepsy.</li>
  <li>From <a href="https://ginaapostol.wordpress.com/2021/12/31/bibliolepsy/">Gina‚Äôs blog post about Bibliolepsy</a>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I began this book when I was nineteen: the year Ninoy Aquino was  murdered on the tarmac by Imelda Marcos‚Äôs goons. In a weird loop, a  circular pattern that mocks my own work‚Äôs ways of shaping time, this  book, my first novel, is out two-times-nineteen years later‚Äîtwo times  the length of my life when I began it. It marks the time I became a  writer. To see it in print beyond its home (it was first published in  the Philippines in 1997, winning the country‚Äôs National Book Award that  year) is for me a kind of grace. For personal reasons having nothing to  do with the novel, I never tried to sell *Bibliolepsy* when I  ended up living in the United States. Its appearance now does not sum up my life (by no means), but it makes me glad. I‚Äôm glad to be  experiencing the happiness I had when the book first came out. </code></li>

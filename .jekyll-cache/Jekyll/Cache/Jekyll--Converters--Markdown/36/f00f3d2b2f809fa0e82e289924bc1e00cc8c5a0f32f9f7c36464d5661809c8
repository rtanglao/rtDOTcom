<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>These days it seems we hear of ‚Äúnothing but‚Äù the power of associative thinking 
in the context of Zettelkasten or digital gardens, driven by the core principle 
of breaking ideas down into atomic concepts to support re-combination and 
serendipitous insight.

However what many who focus on those current trends ignore (or are perhaps
unaware of) is the very long history of tools that support this way of 
working (e.g. wiki, 1995, mind-mapping, 1970 ).

So what, exactly, is the new context added by digital gardens? I‚Äôm not sure I
know yet at a technical level. One clear benefit at an information level is 
that there is no shortage of discussion on how to use those tools to 
support thinking, but I would suggest much of that could be applied to any technology.

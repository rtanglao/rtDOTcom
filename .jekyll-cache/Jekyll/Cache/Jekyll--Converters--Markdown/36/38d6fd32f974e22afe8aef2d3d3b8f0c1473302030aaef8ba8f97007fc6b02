  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/18/p1-windows-laptop-touch-screen-16gb-ram-usb-c-power/">When I posted about Windows laptops recently</a>, I didnâ€™t realize that the Microsoft Surface Book 2 meets all the requirements (and doesnâ€™t have WiFi driver issues unlike Dell XPS 13 and Lenovo and all the others). Unlike the previous generation, it has USB-C power (not to mention a touch screen).</li>
  <li>Since I hate Windows drivers stuff (what is this the 1990s :-) ?!?), I think assuming work will pay the $ that the Surface Book 2â€™s currently the front runner.</li>
  <li>If Microsoft canâ€™t get the drivers right for their own hardware, thereâ€™s no hope for Windows :-) !</li>

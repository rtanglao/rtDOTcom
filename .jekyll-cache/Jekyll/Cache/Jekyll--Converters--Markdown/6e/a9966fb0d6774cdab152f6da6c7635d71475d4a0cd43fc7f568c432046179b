I"è<p>tl;dr Please <a href="https://cypresschallenge.ca/fundraiser/roland">donate</a> to my ride up Cypress Mountain on July 27, 2025, the <a href="http://cypresschallenge.com">Cypress Challenge. 100% goes to Pancreatic Research.</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>On the occasion of my birthday on July 11, 2025 Iâ€™d like you to consider donating to the Cypress Challenge in honour of my mother Sofia who died of pancreatic cancer in 2013 less than week after being diagnosed. Itâ€™s a zero overhead ride so all money goes to Pancreatic Cancer research. We all have limited charity budgets and weâ€™re still living in a pandemic until we get a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9595357/">sterilizing vaccine</a> so if donation isnâ€™t possible, please send healing and innovation vibes to the incredible pancreatic researchers at BC Cancer (and of course Iâ€™d love some good bicycling karma for the 12km ascent to Cypress!).</li>

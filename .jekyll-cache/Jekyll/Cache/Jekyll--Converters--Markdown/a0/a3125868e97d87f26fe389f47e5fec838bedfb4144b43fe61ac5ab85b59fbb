CSS is awesome and I want my tools to amplify the way that CSS had been designed....If you agree with the first statement but you then try using a declarative tool like Utopia or Every Layout, you will probably have a bad time. Youâ€™ll probably hate it. You may declare the tool to be â€œbadâ€....Likewise if you agree with the second statement but you then try using an imperative tool like Tailwind, you will probably have a bad time. Youâ€™ll probably hate it. You may declare the tool to be â€œbadâ€.</code></p>

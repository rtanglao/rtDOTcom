Here's the <a href="/archives/2008/10/07/knight-foundations-news-challenge-last-night-oct-6-2008-wsusan-mernit">Knight News Challenge Question and Answer with Susan Mernit</a> portion of the <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1332592">video</a> (i missed the last few questions because I ran out of disk space, this video was 800MB!). I think it answers a lot of the common questions and shows how Susan is an engaging, articulate and savvy person.

</ul>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

"Witness this nearly idea-free interview with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, also in the Times, where the meticulously media-prepped executive opines on whether his industry has a role to play in societyâ€™s ills: â€œEvery generation is worried about the new technology, and feels like this time itâ€™s different. Our parents worried about Elvis Presleyâ€™s influence on kids. So, Iâ€™m always asking the question, â€œWhy would it be any different this time?â€ Having said that, I do realize the change thatâ€™s happening now is much faster than ever before. My son still doesnâ€™t have a phone.â€
<br /><br />

Pichaiâ€™s son may not have a phone, but he is earning money mining Ethereum (really, you canâ€™t make this shit up). Iâ€™m not sure the son of a centi-millionaire needs to earn money â€“ but it certainly is useful to master the algorithms that will soon control nearly every aspect of human life. So â€“ no, son, no addictive phone for you (even though my company makes them, and makes their operating systems, and makes the apps which ensure their addictive qualities).
<br /><br />

But mining crypto currency? Absolutely!
<br /><br />

Should Harari be proven right and humanity becomes irrelevant, Iâ€™m pretty sure Pichaiâ€™s son will have a first class ticket out of whatever mess is left behind. But the rest of us? We should probably focus on making sure that kid never needs to use it.

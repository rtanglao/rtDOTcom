I"”<p>There are countless geeky, nerdy, folks in late 2012 "whingeing" :-) about</p>
<ol><li>how they used to take great DSLR photos but&nbsp; it was too heavy &amp; inconvenient to post photos,</li><li>so they switched to a cameraphone</li><li>but are tired of its bad photos.</li></ol>
<p>Simple solution:</p>
<ol><li>buy a $150 dollar point and shoot like the <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ICAA2400BK.html?emailprice=t&amp;utm_term=Other&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Other&amp;utm_source=rflAID021866">Canon Powershot A2400</a> which you can get for $70 (or a $200 Olympus E-PL1 or EPM-1 with the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-BCL-15mm-f8-0-Panasonic-Cameras/dp/B009DL0LOW">Olympus bodycap lens</a> for $59 if you want something even more awesome for $260 instead of $150 or less),</li><li>a $99 Eye-Fi card.</li><li>Carry the camera in your pocket at all times.</li><li>Post photos from the Eye-Fi via your cameraphone's WIFI access point</li></ol>
<p><strong>This makes it convenient and quick like your cameraphone but gives you much better image quality that doesn't require filters of doom to make the photos "interesting"!</strong></p>

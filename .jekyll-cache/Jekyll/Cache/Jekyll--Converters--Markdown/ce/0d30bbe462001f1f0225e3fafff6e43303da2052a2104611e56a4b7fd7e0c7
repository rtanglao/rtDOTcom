I"g	<p>I love my Nokia 7610 but it's not a platform.  There are far too many differences in the J2ME and Symbian OS implementations on all the phones out here to make a real platform that developers can develop on top of and make money IMHO. Imagine a world where there were 10 different versions of Mac OS X and Windows deployed on millions of computers (and most people couldn't or wouldn't upgrade the platform to the latest version). That to me is the reality of today's mobile software "platforms": lots of different implementations which are different enough to make writing an app and supporting it very difficult.  Even Nokia can't do it. For example, <a href="http://cognections.typepad.com/lifeblog/2005/11/roland_tanglao_.html">the current version of Lifeblog doesn't run on my 1 year old 7610</a>!</p>

  <li>Always surprises me how many people ask vague questions on support forums, or on twitter, reddit, etc</li>
  <li>What you did, what you expected, what happened, your requirements &lt;â€”- if you can concisely state these things, then you are much more likely to get some response! and if not at least you have a more clarity around the issue which is always useful!</li>

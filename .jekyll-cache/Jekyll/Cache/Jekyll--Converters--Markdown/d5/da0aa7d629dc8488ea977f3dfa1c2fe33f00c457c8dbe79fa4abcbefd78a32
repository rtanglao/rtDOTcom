Does Vancouver drive away more creative people than it attracts? Affordability aside, what other factors influence this issue? In particular, what are the forces that draw people here? Where does the potential lie?

<p>UPDATE: Sat December 3, 2016 - <strong>This state where folks like me know basically zero about indigenous folks and have basically zero interaction with indigenous folks is the largest bubble in Canada (next to the ‚Äúdoing not enough about global climate change‚Äù bubble), right</strong>?</p>

<p>Again, I don‚Äôt know how to answer this question but I know that the answer cannot be complete without the indigenous folks.</p>

<p>They‚Äôve been here in Vancouver forever and they know how to survive here and how to create here. More dialogue with them (folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/Khelsilem">Khelsilem</a>?) has to be part of the answer. How do we start?</p>

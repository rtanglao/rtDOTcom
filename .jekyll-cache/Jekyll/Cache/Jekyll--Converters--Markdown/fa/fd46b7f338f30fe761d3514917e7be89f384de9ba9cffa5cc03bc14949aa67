    <ul>
      <li>What if I donâ€™t want to remember random factoids/chunks no matter how important (or if itâ€™s really important wonâ€™t you remember them)? or spend my time rote learning anything even if itâ€™s higher level chunks of cool concepts  in front of a screen?</li>
      <li>Iâ€™d rather set it and forget it. i.e. blog or wiki it and have the ability to find it again, it doesnâ€™t serve me well to remember and write down random or even salient 1 sentence â€œfacts/chunksâ€ :-) #ymmv</li>
      <li>I guess for me, unless I apply the chunks/facts/etc into for example make a working software program or a long form piece of writing, I am not going to remember it no matter how much time I spend trying to â€œflash card rememberâ€ it. Iâ€™d rather know where to find stuff rather than remember stuff.</li>

I"<p>Actually, <a href="http://blackrimglasses.com/">Ethan</a>, "MySpace Killer" is not the new black it's the new "Flickr of..." :-) ! Remember the good 'ole days last year when everything was the flickr of something? e.g. the <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/11/06/flickr_of_video_doesnt_exist_my_video_upload_experience">flickr of video</a> (which still doesn't exist IMHO) !

Something i’ve wanted for decades! Every app is a client/server in a multi-player gamer er application :-) -&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Every document in a duplex app is owned by a single device. Ownership can be transferred at any time to any authorized device, and this can be done on the fly without disrupting operation. For example documents could be transferred from a phone to a desktop machine with a better connection and more power. Documents could also be handed off to someone else’s devices. The premium level of duplex apps is to hand off your documents to a paid service that provides service level guarantees for latency and uptime. Paying for document hosting might compromise on security: one must trust the service to keep your data secure (though perhaps it could remain partially encrypted). However you don’t need to worry about losing your data, because it will be cached on your devices, and ownership can be revoked at any time.</code></p>

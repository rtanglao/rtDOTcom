I"…<p>Flickr rocks but this piece really adds no information (the time to write about how great flickr is, what great people <a href="http://sylloge.com/">Stewart</a> and <a href="http://caterina.net/">Caterina</a> are and how much money they got would have been in <a href="http://archive.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/03/22/yahoo_buys_flickr_flickrtime_rules_for_web_20_apps">Spring 2005 just after the acquisition</a> not Spring 2006). Instead of concentrating on yesterday&#39;s news, the Globe and Mail Report on Small Business should be covering today&#39;s Canadian small businesses i.e. <a href="http://eqo.com/">EQO</a>, <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a>, etc rather than last year&#39;s small businesses like flickr.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060412.wexitstrategy0412/BNStory/specialSmallBusiness/home">globeandmail.com : Exit strategy: Cashing out, staying in</a>.:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks to Yahoos traffic, Flickr membership has quadrupled to </p> <p>2.5 million, and the site has emerged as the linchpin of its new owners social-networking strategy--that is, to reposition Yahoo as a venue for people to connect and share experiences, rather than simply as a place they go to search and shop. </p> <p>Because of that shift, Yahoo is closing in on Google, the do-everything juggernaut a few kilometres down the Valley. Which raises the question: Given Flickrs strategic significance, did Butterfield and Fake sell out too soon?</p>  <p>If they did, they dont seem to be regretting it. Money is clearly not this couples primary motivation. Instead of blowing their cash on Porsches or a sprawling manse, they rent a modest house in San Franciscos still-gentrifying Mission district. &quot;We have a Prius for the fuel economy,&quot; he says. &quot;And we share it.&quot;</p> </blockquote>

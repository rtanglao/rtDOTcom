  <li>Originally on Twitter on Feb 2, 2021: <a href="https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/1356862249533546499">Yesterday at 4pmish, I was robbed of my Canon EOS RP camera &amp; my Lumos Matrix helmet while bicycling on the Dunsmuir viaduct. Super weird &amp; random. Luckily Iâ€™m physically unharmed &amp; have insurance but Iâ€™ll probably avoid that route unless there are lots of other riders!</a>

      <li>Nothing more to say really that hasnâ€™t been said in that thread.</li>
      <li>Just blogging it here because in the end I donâ€™t trust it to be saved for posterity :-) not that my blog will live forever either</li>

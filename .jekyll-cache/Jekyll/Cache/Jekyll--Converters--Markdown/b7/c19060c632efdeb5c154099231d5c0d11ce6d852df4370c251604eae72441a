<p>This is the best way I can sum it up: Relevance, presence and revenues in a fickle and fragmented world.</p>

<p>We need to accept that the online landscape is changing rapidly, and not necessarily in a way that makes things easier for us. Those who deal with the issues thrown up by RSS and aggregation over the next 18 months will, I believe, find themselves in a much, much healthier shape to face the next set of challenges that the internet throws our way.</p>

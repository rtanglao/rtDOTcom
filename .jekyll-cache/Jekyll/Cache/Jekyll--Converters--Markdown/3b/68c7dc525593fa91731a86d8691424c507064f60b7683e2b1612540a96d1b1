  <li>Iâ€™ve never been great at navigation so I had a lot of anxiety because Radweg Reisen didnâ€™t provide GPX files (they had Komoot trails on their website that didnâ€™t match up with our tour), just a paper map! I would have  paid an extra 100 Euro for GPX files that one could load into Komoot, Strava or any popular bicycle wayfinding apps. I would still have got lost with the GPX files but much less so and it would have given us a route to go back to when inevitably we took the wrong turn.</li>
  <li>Other than that and it raining half the time (which didnâ€™t bother me in the slightest since I bicycle in hard rain 6 months of the year in Vancouver) the trip was fabulous.</li>
  <li>So privileged to have the physical, mental and financial wherewithal to ride 220 km with brother and sister around the Bodensee (Lake Constance in English),</li>

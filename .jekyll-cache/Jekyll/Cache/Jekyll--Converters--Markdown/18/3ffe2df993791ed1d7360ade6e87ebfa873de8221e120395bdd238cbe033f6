  <li>Strava claims they don’t want to be acquired but how many paying folks do they need to be viable long term? And how will they get them to pay.</li>
  <li>I like Strava; it’s fun :-) for the record. But I don’t pay! To me it feels like flickr in 2005! Great community but unsuspectingly waiting to be usurped by the next big thing? Like Instagram usurped flickr?!?</li>

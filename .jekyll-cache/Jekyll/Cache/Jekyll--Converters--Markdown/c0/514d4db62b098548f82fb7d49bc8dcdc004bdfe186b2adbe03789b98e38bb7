Much better than using videos to learn because you have relevant timecodes and can follow along and go backwards and forwards!  &lt;– QUOTE:

So let’s pull this together. What I want is a tool that:
    <ol>
      <li>Records my interactions with my desktop as a stream of logical events rather than as video.</li>
      <li>Simultaneously, records what I’m saying.</li>
      <li>Allows me to edit the combination in the way that Camtasia or OBS lets me edit screencasts.</li>
      <li>Lets a learner replay the result in a sandbox VM on their computer or in the cloud.</li>
      <li>Lets the learner stop the replay at any point and fork a new VM to play around in.</li>
      <li>When she’s done, lets her throw away that VM and resume the lesson where she left off.<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

Real artists ship! My <a href="http://buglabs.net/">Bug Labs</a> Bundle Arrived today. Check out my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/sets/72157610837577626/">BUGbundle unboxing pics</a> (including the nice touch of the team's signatures inside the box.). The Camera module is on back/order but I received a cool von Hippel hacking module as a bonus for the delay. Now for some GPS hacking. Oh, and if anyone else in Vancouver has a BUG, contact me and let's get together to exchange notes!

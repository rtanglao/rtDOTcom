<p>(See <a href="http://michaelkalus.ca/2017/02/26/sigges-pyak-2017-race-report/">my friend Michael Kalusâ€™s 2017 Payak report for a 30km skate perspective</a>).</p>

<p>I took the <a href="http://www.payak.ca/">Payak</a> 2017 more seriously than the Payak 2016. Ate more and better, hydrated more, got better skis (right after Payak 2016, I bought my first pair of classic skis in 20 years, lighter, shorter â€œskinâ€ skis) and had the skis hot waxed at Siggeâ€™s. I also paid more attention to my technique; shorter strides on the up hill, better double poling on the flats.</p>

<p>It paid off in 2017. My time in 2017 was 1:25 instead of 1:49.</p>

<p>But maybe it wasnâ€™t me?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The snow was better, more of it!</li>
  <li>It was actually -2 to +2 instead of +10 so the snow wasnâ€™t lumpy molasses.</li>
  <li>The classic track was fantastically groomed; my top speed was 47km/h instead of last  yearâ€™s 40km/h. The skate lane was great too from what I could tell.</li>
  <li>The only danger zone was porterâ€™s glide; it was a sharp right turn at top speed; I figured that was my 47km/h. Last Monday during training, I didnâ€™t tuck and was going half the speed; today I got into my downhill tuck for over 500 metres I figure and didnâ€™t realize my speed and that the turn would be so treacherous.</li>
  <li>Things I did right: drinking water before the race (should have drank 0.5 liter more), eating before the race (didnâ€™t eat too little or too much), right clothing (no hat, short sleeve thermal underneath a long sleep zip neck thermal; I would say at least 50% of all the 15km racers were wearing too many layers and carrying too much weight.</li>
  <li>Things I didnâ€™t do right: well as usual I didnâ€™t train enough; I donâ€™t have enough upper body i.e. arm strength and I really should polish my uphill technique and improve my uphill stamina.</li>
  <li>Next year: 15km on skate skis!</li>
</ul>

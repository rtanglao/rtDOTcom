<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

"Put yourself in situations where you canâ€™t ignore feedback from multiple sources. In studies, one friend is only a little better at gauging a personâ€™s intelligence and creativity than they themselves are; four friends are significantly better. When I infiltrated the writersâ€™ room at The Daily Show, the host, Trevor Noah, told me he makes up 90 percent of his stand-up comedy on stage. He just starts riffing on topics and gets instant input on whatâ€™s funny from a whole crowd. And at Bridgewater, the ratings are weighted by how believable your colleagues have proven themselves to be in each domain. When five of your close colleagues have a track record of being highly organized and they all say youâ€™re not, itâ€™s tough to argue that youâ€™re right and theyâ€™re wrong."

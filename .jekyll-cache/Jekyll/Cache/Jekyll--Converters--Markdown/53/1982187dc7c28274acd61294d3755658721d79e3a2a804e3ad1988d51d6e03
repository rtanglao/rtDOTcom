I"^<p>Yet another takeaway:</p>

<p><a href="http://mt.middlebury.edu/middblogs/ganley/bgblogging/">Barbara Ganley</a>’s presentation crystallized something for me.  As long as you have an evangelist (technical or non technical) who has a passion for social software like blogs and wikis and  who’s not afraid to nurture its use in a community, the software is good enough.</p>

<p>Not that we don’t have a long way to go and many miles to go before social software is truly usable by all, but just to re-affirm that the present generation of tools is “good enough” to make it worth using NOW!</p>

I"À<p>Read <a href="http://danbricklin.com/log/podcastingsetup.htm">the whole thing</a>! Need to document my podcasting setup. Dan's setup is way too overpriced for me and his workflow way too time consuming for most (including me) but I am sure there's some lessons in it for me!</p>

<blockquote><p>I have now (as of May 27, 2005) posted three podcasts for Software Garden which have been listened to by a few thousand people, and have done recordings for some private ones in the past. I'm about to record a lot more. I've done some research and bought some equipment which I've tried. Here's what I've learned so far. Note that I am not an audio engineer, so I may have all the wrong stuff. However, I know that I've appreciated the help of others and I share what I have here hoping it will help others.</p></blockquote>

I"<p>What can geeks do part 8888? If you believe in the enlightenment and science then the best way is to publish your stuff on your own domain on your blog and your own <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/24/p1-rolandex-for-my-personal-wiki/">wiki</a> (<a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">yes both a blog and a wiki!</a>) in HTML (<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/03/22/markdown-a-more-frictionless-way-to-enter-html-and-xhtml-for-blog-posts/">or simple text formats that convert to HTML easily like Markdown which Iâ€™ve been advocating since 2004</a>).</p>

<p>Move forward! Progress! Science! Facts! Document it all! Just say NO to the forces of sexism, racism and other things on the wrong side of history and science!</p>

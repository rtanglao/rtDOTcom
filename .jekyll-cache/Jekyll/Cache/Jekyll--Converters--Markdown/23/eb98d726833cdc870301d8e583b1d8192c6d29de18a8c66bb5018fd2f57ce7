Substack is funded by terrible people and supports terrible people on its platform (as well as great people who don’t realize that they are helping those terrible people) part 88888 ; Joan Westenberg:: Comfort Food for the Thinking Class: The Great Intellectual Stagnation</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Our intellectual underground, such as it is, consists of Substack, a platform funded by some of the most establishment venture capital imaginable, and podcasts that run for three hours and manage to say less than a single well-constructed paragraph.</code></p>

It is wrong to be on a platform that openly allows hate speech. If the Nazi Party’s newspaper paid you $USD1000 / month in 1939 to write an op-ed monthly would you do it? No. https://om.co/2025/08/03/the-why-of-substack/ is wrong. sorry not sorry Om et al!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</a></li>

I"{<p> I tried USB and Bluetooth but couldn&#39;t get <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/link?cid=PLAIN_TEXT_215716">Nokia Media Transfe</a>r to work with my N800. Nokia please fix in future betas. Not a surprise since it&#39;s not on the compatibility list.  I hesitate to try it on my N93 since I only have 2GB of storage there and it&#39;s mostly full of kid videos and pics! </p>

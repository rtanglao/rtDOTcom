I"R<p>Should have read <a href="http://www.akuaku.org/">Dav's blog</a> sooner!  It's good to know that I am not going crazy and the 7610 (which <a href="http://kokochi.com/">Mie</a>, Dav's partner uses) really cannot take full 1 mega pixel photos from Java, only from C.  Talk about brain damaged and yet another proof that Java s*cks (although to be fair, I probably should say that J2ME s*cks and not Java in general).

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>J2ME does have a Mobile Multimedia API which can access the camera and create its own jpgs, but (and there's always a 'but' in J2ME I've learned) the quality of mmapi jpegs are far, far worse than those the native camera application is capable of producing. I've done a lot of web searching on this issue, and it seems universally accepted. It was past midnight at this point, so I said "screw the quality" and moved on.</p></blockquote>

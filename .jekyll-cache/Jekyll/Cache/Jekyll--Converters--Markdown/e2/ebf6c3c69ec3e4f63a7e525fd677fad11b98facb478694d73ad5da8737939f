Much better than using videos to learn because you have relevant timecodes and can follow along and go backwards and forwards!  &lt;â€“ QUOTE:</li>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>So letâ€™s pull this together. What I want is a tool that:
  1. Records my interactions with my desktop as a stream of logical events rather than as video.
  2. Simultaneously, records what Iâ€™m saying.
  3. Allows me to edit the combination in the way that Camtasia or OBS lets me edit screencasts.
  4. Lets a learner replay the result in a sandbox VM on their computer or in the cloud.
  5. Lets the learner stop the replay at any point and fork a new VM to play around in.
  6.  When sheâ€™s done, lets her throw away that VM and resume the lesson where she left off.

I"h<p>You ain't seen nothing yet. Low tech small "a" AI, blah blah there is so much we could do to improve our personal Internet reading experience that hasn't been done *yet* by Google Reader or Flipboard or anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE from an amazing article that brings up almost everything that you'd want to consider if you read the internet: "<a href="http://www.rumproarious.com/feeding-our-reading-habits/">Feeding our Reading Habits"</a><br /></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>"Don't feel guilty about not reading the millions of pieces of information that pile up on your door everyday. <strong>Just don't</strong>. Half the battle in this modern era of information overload is learning how to not care about all the information. We call them feeds, or streams for a reason: they never end. Your only goal should be to <strong>build a better net</strong>. It's not to worry about unread counts or friend requests, or virtual corn fields.</p><p>Take your net, dip it into the stream, and see what comes out."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

  <li>Juicy quote: “What remains to be seen is how the new uses of <em>they</em> will play  out in Standard Written English. How much ambiguity will it cause? How  often will pronoun references become unclear? To take the most extreme  instance, how will criminal statutes be drafted? <em>A person is guilty of conspiracy if, together with one or more others, they</em> . . . Does that <em>they</em> refer to the single person or to the people acting together? Hundreds  of thousands of statutes and regulations might need to be rewritten if  the singular <em>they</em> becomes a preferred policy.” &lt;— I am sure we’ll figure this out!</li>

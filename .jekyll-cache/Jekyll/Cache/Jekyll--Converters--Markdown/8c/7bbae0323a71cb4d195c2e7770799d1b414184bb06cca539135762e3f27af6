I"Ž<p>Check out <a href="http://picturem.com/roland/BlogSpace">my PictureM Blog</a>.  Looks very rough and hard to use.  But hey itâ€™s still in beta, right? Isnâ€™t everything? The <a href="/rt/javascript:openWin('/roland/BlogSpace/default/4S5IO8JHQJ/_filmstrip-')">Filmstrip</a> and <a href="/rt/javascript:openWin('/roland/BlogSpace/default/4S5IO8JHQJ/_slideshow-')">Slideshow</a> features are very cool but again are unpolished and non-intuitive as well as non linkable (the preceding links to my slideshow and my filmstrip are Javascript links that therefore donâ€™t work!).  I think thereâ€™s some real potential here ; Iâ€™ll wait for 2.0.  Until then Iâ€™ll use <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> (disclosure: I am addicted to Flickr; <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/">I have uploaded over 2000 pictures there</a> and I know and like Caterina and Stewart, 2 of the key Flickr people!).</p>

  <li>How does Stephen do this? Since I learned about him in the early 2000s heâ€™s been concisely and beautifully summarizing things over at downes.ca at <a href="https://www.downes.ca/index.html">oldaily</a>. Amazing body of work this alone! But wait thereâ€™s more! He gives talks and he writes essays on his <a href="https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/">half an hour blogspot blog</a>.</li>
  <li>â€œThis is a really good but conceptually difficult essay with an important point to make: thereâ€™s no one best way to teach computer programming. Thereâ€™s no natural ordering of concepts from foundational to advanced.â€ &lt;â€” read Stephenâ€™s summary post, <a href="https://www.downes.ca/post/68266">Programming Paradigms and Beyond</a>  AND <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kf-prog-paradigms-and-beyond/paper.pdf">the whole PDF</a> .</li>

<p>My friend Fernando Medrano posts excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/fmedeats">food related links</a> and excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/fernandomedran0">political links</a> to Facebook (as well as twitter but mostly Facebook) which you can’t search or find later because Facebook s*xors that way :-)</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be great if somebody wrote a scraper that posted those links to pinboard or tumblr?</p>

<p>Doesn’t strike me as difficult! Just get Facebook updates via email and email them to tumblr?!?! Can you still get Facebook updates via email?</p>

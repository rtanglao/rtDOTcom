  <li>Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1363695752929828872?fbclid=IwAR1JmJlw0k4gwkW6_kb8EZwV7C_GScHknM61iTiyDYiMsjXjGFF53Wszk5c">Anil Dash’s tweet</a>: “Ahhhh omg it feels so validating to hear this has a name! I really struggle with talking over people (I understand many experience this very negatively) but it’s an incredibly difficult pattern to change because it’s literally how I grew up communicating enthusiasm &amp; support. <a href="https://twitter.com/erinbiba/status/1363694245819936768">https://twitter.com/erinbiba/statu”</a></li>
  <li>I like to think I am a positive cooperative overlapper :-) but sometimes I am not!</li>
  <li>Can I handle it when others do it to me? Hmmm not as much as I think I would like to be able!</li>
  <li>Need to reacquire: <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/conversational-style-9780195221817?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;">Deborah Tannen’s Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends</a> (first published 1984, revised 2005).  I read at least one of <a href="http://www.deborahtannen.com/">Deborah Tannen</a>’s books in the 90s not sure if it was this one, no pre-COVID and pre-parenthood memory or something :-)  ! I recall her being an excellent writer and explainer of these topics!</li>

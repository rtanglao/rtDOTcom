The deal is done and should be announced this weekâ€¦(Updated: it might be announced tomorrow AM now.)
Among the other companies Weblogs Inc talked to included the usual suspects: News Corp, Yahoo and MSNâ€¦
This is a very quick exit: the company was founded about two years ago, and took some money from Mark Cuban a year down the line. For Calacanis, this is his second company being sold in a space of about two yearsâ€¦his original company Rising Tide Studios was first sold to Wicks Business Information, which in itself was bought out by Dow Jones.
The companyâ€™s blogs have had an exponential trajectory, with sites like Engadget, Autoblog, BloggingBaby, and others. In total, the company has about 130 bloggers, with about 15 full time employees, from what I know. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="citation"&gt;<cite cite="http://www.paidcontent.org/pc/arch/2005_10_05.shtml#051691"></cite>&lt;/p&gt;<br /><!-- technorati tags begin -->&lt;p style="font-size:10px;text-align:right;"&gt;Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/weblogsinc" rel="tag">weblogsinc</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/ aol " rel="tag"> aol </a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/blogs rss" rel="tag">blogs rss</a>&lt;/p&gt;<!-- technorati tags end --></p>

  <li>Read <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2395489/strava-james-quarles">Why Strava Is Getting More Social Than Ever</a> (outsideonline)</li>
  <li>Strava claims they donâ€™t want to be acquired but how many paying folks do they need to be viable long term? And how will they get them to pay.</li>
  <li>I like Strava; itâ€™s fun :-) for the record. But I donâ€™t pay (yet, Iâ€™ll probably start paying soon because I feel that itâ€™s the only way to really support them and keep them viable)! To me it feels like flickr in 2005! Great community but unsuspectingly waiting to be usurped by the next big thing? Like Instagram usurped flickr?!?</li>

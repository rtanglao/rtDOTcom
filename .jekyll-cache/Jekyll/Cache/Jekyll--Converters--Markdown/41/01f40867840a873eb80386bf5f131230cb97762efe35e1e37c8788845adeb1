Some quotes:
    <ul>
      <li>â€ One of the ways we can do this is by lowering the energy demand of the  digital products and services weâ€™re designing, making it more accessible to people with slower internet connections or on older devices. For <em>Branch</em> we wanted to design something that still looked designed, and worked at a low bandwidth environment, but didnâ€™t end up looking too anodyne.â€</li>
      <li>â€œ<em>Branch</em> was also designed to be â€˜Demand Responsiveâ€™ to adapt to  and reflect the physical infrastructure of the internet and the energy  behind it. Utilising data from a grid intensity API and the userâ€™s  location, <em>Branch</em> has different interface designs that are shown dependent on the current energy demand and fossil fuels on the grid  where the user is.  â€œ</li>

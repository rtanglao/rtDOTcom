    <p>Alicia Juarerroâ€™s main points according to Chris Corrigan:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>â€œNature uses constraints to generate emergence and sustain it. Constraints both limit and enable.</li>
      <li>Evolution selects for resilience, adaptability, and evolvability.</li>
      <li>Resilience is sustained by micro-diversity.</li>
      <li>Ecosystems are sustained by distributed control rather than governing control. The key is in the links.</li>
      <li>The emergence of novel practices â€“ innovation â€“ cannot be caused, but novelty can be enabled. You do this by catalyzing conditions that allow innovation to occur.</li>
      <li>Think of constraints as phenomena that change the likelihood of things, and the probabilities of what is going on.â€ &lt;â€“ read the whole thing <a href="www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/constraints-that-enable-emergence/">Chris Corrigan: Constraints that enable emergence</a></li>

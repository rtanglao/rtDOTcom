    <p>“In summary, the Mea Culpa idea involves three changes on Twitter:</p>

    <p>\1. <strong>Add the ability to admit a mistake</strong>, which shuts down tweet amplification</p>

    <p>\2. <strong>Add corrections</strong> in the home feeds of those who reacted to it, which helps inform  readers so they may adjust what they feel about the poster and may  become better informed</p>

    <p>\3. <strong>Add a way to forgive the poster</strong> for those who reacted, which creates an incentive to admit mistakes in  the future, and helps repair any relationship damage between people” &lt;– Love this idea from <a href="https://nickpunt.com/blog/deescalating-social-media/">Nick Punt::De-Escalating Social Media Designing humility and forgiveness into social media products</a></p>

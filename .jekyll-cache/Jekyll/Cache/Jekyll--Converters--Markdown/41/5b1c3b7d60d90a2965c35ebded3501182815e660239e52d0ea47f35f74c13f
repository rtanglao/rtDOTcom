  <li>Read the whole thing to learn about Notion, Keybase, Streak CRM, slack etc in addition to useful advice about videconferencing with Zoom and other products: <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20200309">Several grumpy opinions about remote work at Tailscale</a> and or check out these quotes:</li>
  <li>“The very latest 2019 iPad Pro  has a pretty great front-facing camera that works in low light (the best  kind of light), so that’s what I use now.”</li>
  <li>“Airpods (when connected to iPhones or iPads) have very low latency, not  detectable by humans.”</li>
  <li>“I mounted my iPad above my monitor, at the so-called “selfie angle,” using  a <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06WGNP9HD/ref=pe_3034960_233709270_TE_item">$40   iPad mount I bought from Amazon</a>. Mounting it this way has two  advantages: I look slightly up at the person I’m talking to rather than  down, and when I type notes into my computer, it doesn’t look like I’m off  to the side.”</li>
  <li>“Short answer: iPad + Airpods + Whereby is a really great combination in 2020. And it also works well with Zoom, which is good because you’re stuck with it.”</li>
  <li>I don’t have a  recent iPad Pro but I might try this.</li>

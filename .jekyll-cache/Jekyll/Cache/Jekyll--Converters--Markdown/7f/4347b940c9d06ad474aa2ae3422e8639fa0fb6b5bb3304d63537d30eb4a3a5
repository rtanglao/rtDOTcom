<p>tl;dr If you are the 1% who value a cameraphone with fantastic photos above total experience (user experience, dev experience, apps experience, etc), then the N8 is for you. For others who only require a decent camera and are&nbsp; not cameraphone camera obsessed like I am, there are plenty of&nbsp; alternatives in 2011 with better user, dev and apps experiences which I won't bother to name!</p>
<p>On the eve of Nokia's February 11, 2011 announcements, it seems appropriate to review the Nokia N8. For those who don't know I have taken <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/cameraphone">over 50,000 photos with Nokia cameraphones</a> (7610,N70,N80,N73,N93,N85,N82,N900 and now the N8) since I first bought my first Nokia cameraphone back in 2004, the Nokia 7610 a 1 megapixel cameraphone.</p>
<h3>What I love about the camera:</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/n8photo">The photos the photos the photos</a>. Can't believe how great they are! Thanks!</li><li>Fastest shot to shot of any cameraphone I have ever used. faster than our Canon point and shoot.</li><li>Fastest auto-focus. Until the N8 I almost never used Nokia cameraphone focus, because it was too slow.</li><li>Best Sensor</li></ul>
<p>In other words the hardware and the sensor and the embedded software of the N8 camera are unparalleled. Thanks to those at Nokia responsible for the hardware and the sensor and the embedded software. A+ !!!!</p>
<h3>What is substandard about the camera is the software i.e. the Nokia camera application:</h3>
<ul><li>basically unchanged since the N80 in 2006.&nbsp; Menus and user experience hasn't changed much since the N80 and N95 days back in 2006 and 2007. Over 5 years of wasted user experience improvement potential</li><li>Sometimes the camera app appears to crash and gives you a deceptive error message very similar to the one pictured above i.e. implying you need to restart the N8 to get the camera app working. This is deceptive and broken because you don't have to restart the N8; you simply have to quit and restart the camera app. Unacceptable that this has been appearing in Nokia camera apps since 2006</li></ul>
<h3>Substandard experiences of the current N8 pre PR 1.1&nbsp; (I still haven't been able to upgrade to the newly released PR1.1):</h3>
<ul><li>Dev experience: doesn't work on a Mac or Linux as smoothly as Windows and there is no grassroots, innovative developer energy going forward with Qt. Get rid of the Mac and Linux versions or get them working properly and as smoothly as Windows. Qt is confusing and old school C++ without any of the refinement of other platforms. QML has great potential but is still not mature enough.</li><li>User Experience - Symbian^3 is much better than any previous Symbian on a touchscreen phone but it is still feels cobbled together and like a wart on a wart (power management and voice quality and true multitasking are the only exceptions which like awesome cameraphones nobody really cares about unfortunately!). And the primitive out of date web browser built-in to the N8 (I am aware that for PR 2.0 in March or April there will be an up to date browser, but "real artists ship" :-) !)&nbsp; is an embarassment and very frustrating for users.</li><li>Apps Experience - I could go on and on about this but here is one example close to my heart: given Nokia's ridiculously large lead in cameraphones (at one point, Nokia was at least 3 years ahead of Apple and Android in cameraphone technology and software), it would stand to reason that there would be lots of great camera apps but there are none. It's really hard to use the OVI store and it's not built into the pre PR 1.1 firmware!</li></ul>

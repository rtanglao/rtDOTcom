Yes….AND :-) I still think be able to run your own instance of 1 all-in-one-thing-that-includes-public-or-private-blogging-social-whatever is the best thing to do. Too bad it’s currently hard to do that unless you have $ and technical chops ideally both.

If you’ve read this far, you can probably tell that I lean toward big fedi, inclusion, opt-out federation, and opt-out bridging. Even so, I know open federation doesn’t fit all communities. Consent-based, opt-in federation is a great option, especially when it’s based on communities instead of networks or protocols. Moderate people, not code.</code></p>

Guardian Unlimited (website)</p>

<p>Blogging is 5-10% of her job (news and politics desk editor)</p>

<p>Writes 2 other blogs - Guardian Unlimited and US Vote 2004, plus personal</p>

<p>Blogs even among young in the UK have not penetrated the consciousness</p>

<p>Salam Pax was promoted by Guardian</p>

<p>He has a book produced by the Guardian - has become mainstream, he now has column in Guardian</p>

<p>Belle du Jour won a Guardian award, prostitute in London, anonymous.</p>

<p>Tension between Guardian (Grauny) and bloggers</p>

<p>Guardian invading the territory of bloggers.</p>

<p>Some bloggers didnâ€™t like the panel of judges. Prefer to be judged by peers.</p>

<p>Journalists love controversy.  So &lt;a href=â€/rt/ane Perrone: â€œBlog to work? Blogging and journalismâ€â€œ&gt;Tom Coates of Plastic Bag&lt;/a&gt; not liking it was great!</p>

<p>Vowed publicly never to have a personal blog.</p>

<p>But of course now she does <a href="http://perrone.blogs.com/">perrone.blogs.com</a>.  A space in between personal and business life.</p>

<p>It has proved useful.</p>

<p>Now Jane sees the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>Curious about getting more hits, making it â€œbetterâ€, wanting more readers.</p>

<p>Blogging at the Guardian will be news or theme based.</p>

<p>More integral to the Guardian in the future</p>

<p>More important role in covering any major news story.</p>

<p>Transparency: make the rules clear</p>

<p>Adapt Scobleâ€™s corporate blog manifesto.</p>

<p>Could easily be adapted for journalist bloggers.</p>

<p>Guardian is transparent and has  people who monitor feedback.</p>

<p>When responding on Guardian blog, she is speaking as an Guardian individual journalist not for the entire paper.</p>

<p>Will see journalists who do 50% blogging.</p>

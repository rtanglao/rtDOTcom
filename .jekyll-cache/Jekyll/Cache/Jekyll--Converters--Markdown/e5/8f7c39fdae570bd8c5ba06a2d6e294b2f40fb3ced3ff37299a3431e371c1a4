I want to be able to press one button and have following happen:
</p>
<ol>
<li>7610 camera takes a picture</li>
<li>picture is displayed</li>
<li>Prompted for a title (I can fill in the rest of the meta data on my Mac later if need be!)</li>
<li>Photo is added to my blog or Flickr via email or XML-RPC or SOAP with the specified title.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Right now this is an unnecessarily complicated and multi step process. Please leave a comment if you know of such an app!
</p>

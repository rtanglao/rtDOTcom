<blockquote>
  <p>A separations regime as described above can prevent some of this wanton data use, but laws targeted toward data protection and sharing can go further. At the very least, clarifications on the legality of using data from other services to train AI models can deter such use. More watertight enforcement of the law will require monitoring mechanisms. For instance, recent work shows that the data used to train a model can potentially be verified.196 Governments can also act to further protect domain-specific data, including healthcare and education data where a concentrated AI market can be especially damaging.</p>

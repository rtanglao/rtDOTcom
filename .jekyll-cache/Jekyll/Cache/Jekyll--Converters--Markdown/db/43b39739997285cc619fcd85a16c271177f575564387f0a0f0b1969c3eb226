  <li>From Arts Umbrella: <a href="https://www.artsumbrella.com/stories/simon-tanglao-vasi/">Learning to work as an artist today with Visual Arts Summer Intensive (VASI)</a> :  “I think that being exposed to contemporary art from all sorts of  perspectives (curatorial, artistic, logistical) has deepened my  appreciation and enjoyment of it as an artist. VASI opened up a lot of  possibilities that I’m thankful for, has continued to shape my practice, and will probably continue for a long time.”</li>

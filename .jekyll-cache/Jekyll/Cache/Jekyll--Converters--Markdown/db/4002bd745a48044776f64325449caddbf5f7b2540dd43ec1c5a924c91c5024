Some of us will make the bad software production quality whatever “‘quality’ means for them, some of us will just blissfully use it even though it’s bug ridden (like most 100% human written software sadly) ; Om Malik:: Software is going to be automated badly but good enough for many personal workflows The Satya of Satya’s Layoff Memo (laying off 9000 employees to hire AI experts and buy into the ‘GPU compute bubble’)</a> &lt;– <a href="https://rolandtanglao.com/2025/06/30/p2151-how-a-91-year-old-vibe-coded-a-complex/">QUOTING Om’s comment</a>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AI (as we know it) is for real. It is good at automation. And frankly, the bespoke nature of software industry makes it ripe for automation. I have no idea what “singularity” or “sentience” looks like, but software is going to be automated, and fast. You can see how much it is working at a low-level. Claude Code is a good tool to experiment. ... That said, so many of the AI concepts are just non-sensical. Redressing the past ideas for AI (automation) age and this new way of “interacting” with software/computers will not work. I am excited for new ideas to emerge.</code></p>

Why do I think all these miraculous folks have help from ‘real’ developers? Having said that I think everybody has been a programmer since Visicalc and even better Google Sheets and in the near future regardless what happens with Machine Learning, everybody will be a full fledged mobile and desktop app developer; Claire Vo:: How a 91-year-old vibe coded a complex event management system using Claude and Replit ¦ John Blackman</a></li>

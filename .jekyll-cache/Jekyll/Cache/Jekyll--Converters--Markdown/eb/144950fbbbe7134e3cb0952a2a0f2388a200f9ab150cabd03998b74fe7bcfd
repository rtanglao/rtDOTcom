I"˜<p>For the 3 people who care :-)</p>
<ol><li>Instead of Google Reader I am using <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old Reader</a>; except for having no business model that I can detect :-) (where do I pay?!?) But it has the all "Old Pre Google+" Google Reader features such as sharing items. If you are a "The Old Reader" user you can follow me directly like in the good 'ole Google Reader days: <a href="http://theoldreader.com/profile/roland">http://theoldreader.com/profile/roland</a></li><li>If you prefer to follow my shares on Google Reader you can do it here: <a href="http://rolandgoodbits.tumblr.com/">http://rolandgoodbits.tumblr.com/</a></li></ol>

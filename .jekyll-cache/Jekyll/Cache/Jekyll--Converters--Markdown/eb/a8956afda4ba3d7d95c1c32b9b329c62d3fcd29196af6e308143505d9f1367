  <li><a href="https://ca.eventbu.com/vancouver/cory-doctorow-in-conversation-with-sean-cranbury/2766128">Cory Doctorow was at SFU Woodwards today May 17, 2017</a> as part of his <a href="http://craphound.com/walkaway/2017/04/21/walkaway-qa-great-debut-novels-collections-and-favorites/">Walkaway</a> book tour.</li>
  <li>My (probably slightly mis-remembered) takeaways:
    <ul>
      <li>In YA fiction you have to explain context which can be a fun for an author but you can’t use all language and all types of plots, adults you don’t have to explain context and you have more freedom with both language and plots; both are challenging and great!</li>
      <li>science fiction helps explain the present rather than predict the future</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

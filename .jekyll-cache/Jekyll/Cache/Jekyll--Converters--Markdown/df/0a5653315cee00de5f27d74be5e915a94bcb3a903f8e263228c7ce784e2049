  <li>This has never happened in 12 years of owning smartphones! I’ve used over 30. The Nokia N95 was indestructible! It worked even when the battery cover broke and I duct taped the battery into place and it worked in the rain even though it wasn’t water proof or water resistant.</li>

And I looked at this <a href="http://thedroidguy.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-troubleshooting">S7 Edge troubleshooting guide</a>.</li>

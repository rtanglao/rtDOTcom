You will find intuitions and examples for Interpretable Machine Learning and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence. The descriptions are complemented by code snippets with examples in R using the ranger, mlr3 and DALEX packages. Finally, the model development process is shown through a comic strip describing the adventures of two characters, Beta and Bit. The interaction of these two characters shows the decisions that analysts often face, whether to try a different model, a different exploration technique, or to look for different data — questions like how to compare models or verify them.</code></p>

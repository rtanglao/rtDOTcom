<blockquote><p><p>I talked to Matt Mullenweg last night by AIM, from a wi-fi connection in Italy. He was just starting to catch up on the story, swamped under a ton of e-mail and interview requests. He wrote something brief on his weblog, and is in the process of composing an official response for the Wordpress homepage. Update: Here it is. Please read it! It addresses many questions.</p></p>

  <li>The BC Ride to Conquer Cancer 2019 was as moving and humbling as <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/08/13/p1-rolling-to-redmond-ride-to-conquer-cancer-2017-poem/">2017</a>.</li>
  <li>So many survivors.</li>
  <li>So many lost.</li>
  <li>So many stories. Hope lives!</li>
  <li>I couldn’t really look at the photos that people attached to their the bicycles as they rode. Too teary!</li>
  <li>I felt healthier and the fact that I could ride the challenge route of 150km so fast and the normal route on day 2 of 105km so fast is a testament to the  training that I did and the amazing advice and coaching from (not in order)
    <ul>
      <li>Coach J (maple syrup and so many tips)</li>
      <li>Brite Coaching (without Zach’s krazy  training ride up Tolmie think I would have been walking up the super steep hill on day 1! The Spanish Bank repeats made the rest of the RCC hills a breeze not to mention riding the UBC crit course)</li>
      <li>the amazing Lotus bicycle club (I have learned so much from riding with the peeps at Lotus; the atmosphere of friendliness and learning together is infectious and without the Brite Coaching training arranged by Lotus, my riding would be so much less efficient and more tiring.</li>
      <li>electrolytes from Precision Hydration (no cramps! no achey feeling two days after! again arranged by Lotus).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And of course hats off to “fastest bicyclist  uphill” <a href="http://mckay.pub/">Andy</a> :-) for waiting for me and pushing me to do the challenge route!</li>
  <li>Biggest thanks to my life, my support, my anchor: my fantastic partner Barb! Thanks for putting up with me being absent all those training hours.</li>
  <li>Mega thanks to all my donors! Thank you thank you thank you! Please donate in 2020 again if you can</li>
  <li>Maybe next year I’ll decorate the 1946 Schwinn and ride the “normal” route for a different kind of challenge :-) ?!?! Who needs more than 8 gears!?!?</li>

  <li>heart rate is wrong on the high boundary; 99% sure my heart rate didn’t go above 180bpm</li>

  <li>the calories is wrong :-) Maybe Strava thought I was riding the much heavier Schwinn :-) ?</li>

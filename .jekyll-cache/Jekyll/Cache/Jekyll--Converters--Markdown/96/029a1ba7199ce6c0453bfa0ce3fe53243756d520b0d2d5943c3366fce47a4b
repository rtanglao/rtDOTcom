  <li>“Premise: FOMO is good. Being plugged in is good. There is valuable info  at all levels from twitter gossip to philosophy books. You should stay  plugged in. You can manage anxiety and beat the House without resorting  to shaming social platforms into managing attention for you. That’s a  terrible yielding of agency.”</li>

  <li>“The reason the unplugging doesn’t work for most people is not that the  Evil Platform Companies are trying to hack your attention and turn you  into a helpless addict (though they are) but because you rationally  realize <em>you need a job in the GSCITC.</em>”</li>

That can be used to solve the ATProto Lexicon Interop problem among others. What am I missing?!? From 2020, what’s the update in 2025?!?

This layer allows developers to maintain strong compatibility with many schema versions without complicating the main codebase. Translation logic is defined by composing bidirectional lenses, a kind of data transformation that can run both forward and backward.</code></p>

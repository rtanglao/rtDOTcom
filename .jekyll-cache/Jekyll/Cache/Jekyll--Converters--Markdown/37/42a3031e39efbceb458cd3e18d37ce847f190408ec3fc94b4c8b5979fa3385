I"¹<p><a href="http://justagwailo.com/">Richard</a> said I have until January 15 :-) so here goes some randomly ordered predictions which are worth what you paid for them!</p>
<ol><li>Social Media microniching and microcontent-fication continues to grow rapidly. Twitter and Seesmic are just the beginning. Old skool bloggers like myself continue to blog and to write large pieces but even for us it's the exception rather than the rule.</li><li>Drupal fervent, creativity, acquisition and expansion continues because Drupal 6 will unleash the creativity of the world. Go <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a> go! Go <a href="http://raincitystudios.com/">Raincity</a> go!</li><li>Apple introduces 3G iPhone not at Macworld but in the spring. Rogers finally brings the iPhone to Canada in time for Christmas 2008. They won't be onboard for the Apple Spring announcement because they still don't "get it" , but they will have no choice for Christmas 2008 since all of the 3G handsets Rogers sells s*ck and nobody will buy them since unlike the iPhone they are unusable and no better than non 3G sets feature wise. [Hope I am wrong about Rogers!]</li><li>Speaking of "get"-ting it. <a href="https://www.translink.bc.ca/">Translink</a> (or whatever they are called now), start to get it. True feedback comes from <strong>BOTH</strong> their old very slow 20th century skool approach (e.g. <a href="https://www.translinklistens.bc.ca/">Translink Listens</a> is a farce for the Internet Generation because you a) never see the results or b) know anything about the people behind the very vague and not useful polls but ok for the old fogeys) <strong>AND</strong> from social media like an official blog, a flickr account and facebook (heck maybe even twitter and Seesmic: e.g. twitter-ing system outages and delays or facebook statusing them would be a lot better than their current very slow 20th century haphazard way of telling us the SkyTrain is down or buses are delayed). The unofficial Translink Attendance at <a href="http://vancouver.transitcamp.org/wiki/">Transit Camp</a> was very encouraging; I'm predicting this type of stuff will become officially supported in 2008.</li><li>Apple sub MacBook. It won't be the return of the Newton and it won't be a big iPhone, it'll be cool (small, instant on and useful) and again it won't be introduced at MacWorld. [Again hope I am wrong here! Hope it comes sooner]</li><li><a href="http://digitalmediaupdate.blogspot.com/2008/01/ciscos-john-chambers-video-is-next.html">The era of dumb non presence aware "high ceremony" audio and video is over</a>. Go <a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>, go <a href="https://www.lypp.com/">Lypp</a>, go <a href="http://iotum.com/">Iotum</a>! All three will prosper in 2008. Skype will too since they are ubiquitous for both.</li><li>Nokia will continue to have the best hardware for mobile devices but unfortunately not the best software. An awesome N93 video cameraphone successor will be introduced that again only early adopters will use and find usable.</li><li>No usable mobile interface that is nearly as usable as Apple's touch interface emerges in 2008. Fingers crossed for 2009 [hope i am wrong about this one too]</li><li>Truly Open Hardware combined with truly Open Software - the trend started by <a href="http://openmoko.com/">Open Moko</a>, <a href="http://www.chumby.com/">Chumby</a> (I've bought a chumby and am mulling some fun but extremely bogus hacks for it :-) !) and <a href="http://buglabs.net/">Bug Labs</a> continues. Hopefully someone will introduce something like The Bug that is less clunky and uses a more malleable dynamic language like Ruby or Python (I am sure somebody will hack The Bug to use Ruby or Python or some such but it's not the same as having something designed from the ground up to use Ruby or Python as its development environment rather than clunky, "strait-jacketed by typing" and verbose Java). [and yes even though it's "clunky" and Java, I am saving my pennies for my own Bug! ]</li><li>Canon introduces an ISO 25600 camera to compete with the Nikon D3 and a 5D replacement with sensor cleaning and clean, usable ISO 6400. I'm saving my pennies (coz I'll never like flash photography although I love the Strobist).</li><li>Nokia or somebody smart buys <a href="http://buglabs.net/">ShoZu</a>. The rest of the world will start to see the advantage of a "straight to the web from the camera" workflow that ShoZu pioneered (<a href="http://www.eye.fi/">Eye-Fi</a> is inferior to ShoZu because it doesn't suspend/resume upon connectivity interruption/resumption but it's <a href="http://commoncraft.com/photo-products-watch-2008">good enough</a> and it works everywhere and I am getting one of their cards pronto! See my earlier <a href="/archives/2007/12/14/rolands-christmas-2007-social-geek-gadget-list">Eye-Fi plug</a>). Why not build ShoZu into micro SD cards ? Just a thought :-) !</li><li>3G and WiFi are now mature enough for a "straight to the web from the camera" workflow for video too. Why should you have to wait? Why can't video be uploaded directly to the web from your camera like you can with photos with ShoZu and Eye-Fi? There really is no reason other than file size and early adopters will start doing that in 2008.</li></ol>

I was right but forgot to blog about it until I read <a href="https://visualsciencelab.blogspot.ca/2016/10/orphaned-systems.html">Kirk Tuck’s blog post about Samsung exiting the camera business</a>.</li>
  <li>Sad that I was right! The NX1 was a great camera by all accounts. Who’s next? Sony? Stranger things have happened. They are riding high now but how profitable are the A77, RX100 and the RX10 really?</li>

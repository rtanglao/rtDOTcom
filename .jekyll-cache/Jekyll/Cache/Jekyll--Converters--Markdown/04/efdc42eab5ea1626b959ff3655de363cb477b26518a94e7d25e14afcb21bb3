<h2 id="juicy-quotes-from-dave-winers-post">Juicy quotes from Dave Winer’s post:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Read the whole thing <a href="https://this.how/bluesky/">Dave Winer:: Bluesky is centralized</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>… no independent alternative has emerged that fully replicates the Bluesky experience. That tells us something. The protocol may allow for it, but the path isn’t clear — or isn’t viable yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…They (other Bluesky apps) offer alternate interfaces, not independence.  We can’t wait for Bluesky to implement a distributed network.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…There is no working system today that lets users take their content, identity, and social graph and continue on seamlessly if Bluesky changes or shuts down. The idea sounds good, but the guarantee doesn’t exist — not yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>..I use Bluesky, just as I use Facebook, because that’s where people I want to connect with are. I don’t have any illusions about our freedom of movement on either platform.</p>
</blockquote>

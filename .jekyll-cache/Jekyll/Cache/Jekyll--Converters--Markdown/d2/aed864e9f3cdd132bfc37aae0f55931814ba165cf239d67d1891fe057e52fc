  <li>First time IRL since February 2020!</li>
  <li>It was cold but felt fast. The cold did slow me down, excuses excuses :-)</li>
  <li>Nice snow! Super fun!</li>
  <li>I only fell once and this was because somebody hit me from behind going downhill but I guess in retrospect I should haven’t done such a wide turn (dynamic “lalas” :-) as my old downhill ski instructor in Ottawa told me at Camp Fortune)</li>

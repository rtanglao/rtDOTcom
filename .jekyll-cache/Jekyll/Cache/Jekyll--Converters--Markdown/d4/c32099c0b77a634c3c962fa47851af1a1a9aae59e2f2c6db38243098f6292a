In person, Russ is an even better "all things mobile" evangelist than he is on his <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">blog</a>.  He gently reminded that there really is no evidence that we are locked into mobile carriers' trunks as I complained about at the mobile blogging session.  Upon further reflection, I think he is right: rather than locking us in trunks, the carriers and the handset manufacturers are simply not making it easy enough (although this is changing e.g. with <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1007622.html">Python on Series 60 Nokia phones</a>) to develop software which could lead to their downfall if Microsoft succeeds in developing a healthy developer ecosystem around their phones before Nokia, Sony and the carriers do!

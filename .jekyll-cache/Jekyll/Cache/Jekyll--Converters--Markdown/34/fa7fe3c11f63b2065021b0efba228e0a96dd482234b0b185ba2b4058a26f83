I"Å<p><em>homogenized smegma that the RIAA pawns off on the public as music</em> has got to be phrase of the week!  Go <a href="http://donatacom.com/">Terry</a>!</p>

<p>Yet another reason not to buy music from the music business whether itâ€™s through RIAA sanctioned downloads or through  CD shops.  I say donâ€™t bother! Buy it direct from the artist!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>All five of the major music companies are discussing ways to boost the price of single-song downloads on hot releases -- to anywhere from $1.25 to as much as $2.49.
This has rankled even Jupiter Research's David Card, normally a defender of the recording industry. "Enough is enough," Card says on his Weblog. "This is plain dumb."

It's both dumb and predictable, and it will further the split between the RIAA and its customers. Ironically, the Wall St. Journal article comes one day after another study was released that undercuts the RIAA's central theme &#8212; that file-sharing (illegal) downloads have cut CD sales by 10%. An AFP report on the study says it just ain't so.

"Downloads have an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero, despite rather precise estimates," authors Felix Oberholtzer of the Harvard Business School and Koleman Strumpf of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill wrote Tuesday.

Oberholtzer and Strumpf added that their conclusions "are inconsistent with claims that file sharing is the primary reason for the recent decline in music sales."

The real issue is the homogenized smegma that the RIAA pawns off on the public as music. I follow this on-going story closely, because it's a classic example of Postmodern economics. Disruptive innovations have undercut the foundation of the recording industry's Modernist institution. While it may take years to fully play out, every day it fights the inevitable, the RIAA loses ground in the bottom-up world wherein Pomos live. The whole thing is a pathetic illustration of "what goes around, comes around," and corporate greed &#8212; thankfully &#8212; will be the ultimate loser.</blockquote>

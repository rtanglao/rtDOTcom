I"Ê<p>Here's how I write Python programs on the N900 on my Mac</p>
<ol><li>installed the ssh package, <a href="http://www.nokian900applications.com/openssh-on-nokia-n900/">open ssh server</a></li><li>via ssh, I use terminal.app to the ip address of the N900 (which I can see at all times with the <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=32394">personal IP address widget</a>) and test stuff out interactively using python's command line interpreter, aka the python <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a></li><li>when i am happy with the code that I have tested the REPL, I add it to the file on the N900 which I edit on emacs running on my mac using <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AngeFtp">ange-ftp</a></li><li>test the code out on the n900 from terminal.app, 90% of the time it just works since I tested it in the REPL unlike my C/C++ days when something you never thought of always required you to re-compile</li></ol>
<p>Easy, peasy. No need to learn silly :-) Java or C+ or wait for compilation and access to the full power of your Mac for google searches plus you can execute on the N900 directly. No need for silly :-) emulators which in my experience aren't very useful.</p>

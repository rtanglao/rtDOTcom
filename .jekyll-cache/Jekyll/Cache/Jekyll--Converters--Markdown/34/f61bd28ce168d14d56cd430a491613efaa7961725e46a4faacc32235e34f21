  <li>The USB Magic Spell from March 20th no longer works sad face.</li>
  <li>Workaround: plugged in USB-A devices into old Anker USB 3 hub and plugged Anker hub into USB-C port (using a USB-A to C converter) of the Dell WD22TB4 Thunderbolt 4 hub. macOS Sonoma 14.4 seems to have broken the USB-A ports on the Dell Thunderbird Hub but luckily the USB-C ports still work in 14.4!</li>

I <strong>had</strong> the N91 firmware blues. I was having the theme reset problem and various other weird problems (including a beta version of ShoZu crashing randomly) reported by others as a problem with the V1.00.028.13 29.03.06 RM-43 version of the N91 firmware that I have (apparently V1.10.030 05-05-06 RM-43 and newer versions fix these problems <a href="http://www.mobile9.com/invboard/index.php?s=a46bf3d655493ddb0403612d5c95eaee&amp;showtopic=23700&amp;pid=211670&amp;st=0&amp;">as reported at mobile 9</a>)   until I reformatted the hard disk.

Fingers crossed, things are working now (for me a phone isn't working until ShoZu works :-) ! ). It looks like my problems were due to one or more of the following
</p>
<ol>
<li>the firmware version</li>
<li>the Nokia podcasting app (which is in beta)</li>
<li>the Nokia Wireless Keyboard app (which doesn't officially support the N91 but I was assured would work)</li>
<li>puTTY series 60 v3 beta or</li>
<li> the ShoZu beta</li>
</ol>
<p>
which were the only apps I had installed (and yes I am well aware as an ex developer of the perils of running beta software which is why I am not flaming or blaming anybody :-) ! ).

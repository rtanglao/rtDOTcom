<p>However what many who focus on those current trends ignore (or are perhaps unaware of) is the very long history of tools that support this way of working (e.g. wiki, 1995, mind-mapping, 1970 ).</p>

<p>So what, exactly, is the new context added by digital gardens? I’m not sure I know yet at a technical level. One clear benefit at an information level is that there is no shortage of discussion on how to use those tools to support thinking, but I would suggest much of that could be applied to any technology.`</p>

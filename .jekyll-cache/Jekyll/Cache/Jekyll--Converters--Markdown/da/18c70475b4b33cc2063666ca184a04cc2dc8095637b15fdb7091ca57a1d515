I"Ò<p> Despite his fondness for hanging with Boris until odd hours, it was great to meet BarCamp and <a href="http://barcamp.org/DemoCamp">DemoCamp</a> organizer <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/">David Crow</a> (I learned alot from him that we will apply to forthcoming BarCamp Vancouver which will be in August (got a space? let me know!) and Bar Camp Whistler in Winter 2007 which <a href="http://blogs.ebusiness-apps.com/andre/">Andre Charland</a> will be organizing and I&#39;ll be doing a wee bit of help) and even nicer to hear him come on board as <a href="http://davidcrow.ca/article/1117/innovation-commons">Executive Director</a> of the <a href="http://innovationcommons.ca/">Innovation Commons</a>. Go David go! </p>

  <li>This is the product apple should have introduced day 1 (of course watchOS 1 was not as bad as the first version of macOS for my late great Mac 7500 PPC). I see no reason to upgrade my watch hardware with watchOS 3. The compelling upgrade for me would be a watch with its own connectivity which unfortunately is still its own SIM card. C‚Äômon it‚Äôs 2016 can we get beyond the ‚Äútyranny‚Äù of the SIM card?</li>
  <li>It is faster.</li>
  <li>Siri is almost 100% reliable now.</li>
  <li>The button as dock works much better. The button was useless before.</li>
  <li>Apps are now at an acceptable speed!</li>

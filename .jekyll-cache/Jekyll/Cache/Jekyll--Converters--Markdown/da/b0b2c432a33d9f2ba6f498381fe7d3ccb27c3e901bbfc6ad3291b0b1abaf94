    <blockquote>
      <p>Here is what I believe today: `</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Words are something you live by. They are defined by your actions, not by other words.</li>
        <li>We rely too much on numerical measures and reducing things to formulasâ€”the most valuable things in human life resist quantification.</li>
        <li>Iâ€™m referring to core human valuesâ€”such as love, compassion, forgiveness, trust, kindness, fidelity, decency, hope, etc. These are practices not arguments, and hence require no appeal to a larger context. Anyone who claims they require arguments (for falling in love or acting compassionately, for example) should be treated with extreme caution.</li>
        <li>Above all, beware of people who wonâ€™t do a good deed until they have calculated the long-term consequences and expect certain desired results in return. Maybe you can do a business deal with them (or maybe not), but never get into a close personal relationship with them.</li>
        <li>Gratuitous actions of generosity and kindness are best done without calculating rewards or consequences (which, by the way, is the reason Iâ€™ve celebrated gift giving and the bonds of trust and love it creates in my writings).</li>
        <li>Some choices are intrinsically evil. No larger context can cleanse them of this evil.</li>
        <li>Practicing good must begin in the immediate context of your lifeâ€”in your actual actions today, not in some mythical past or dreamt-of future. And finallyâ€¦.</li>
        <li>Take care of Granny.</li>

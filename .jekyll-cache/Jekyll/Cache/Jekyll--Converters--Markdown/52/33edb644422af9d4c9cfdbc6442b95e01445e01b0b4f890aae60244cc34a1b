  <li>The demise of EverNote (see <a href="https://usefyi.com/evernote-history/">Ahead of Its Time, Behind the Curve: Why Evernote Failed to Realize Its Potential</a>) just shows that static HTML pages in the form of a <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/27/p1-email-will-fail-in-2018-use-todo-crm-database-wiki-blogs-etc-instead/">blog and/or a wiki</a> and links is all you need in the end; everything else is icing on the cake.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t depend on somebody elseâ€™s clouds or servers or even your own computer to store all your personal notes, itâ€™s fine to use fancy tools like EverNote but place your real bets on a collection of  static html pages that you can use and move anywhere.</li>

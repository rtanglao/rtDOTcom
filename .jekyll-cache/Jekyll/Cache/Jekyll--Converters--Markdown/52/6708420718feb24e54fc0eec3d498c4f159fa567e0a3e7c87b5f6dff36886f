<p>It was great fun moderating a panel discussion on mobile social networking as part of <a href="http://www.winbc.org/files/events/momovan/050508.html">MoMoVan May 2008</a>. Fun bantering with <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca/news/judall">Jim Udall</a>, <a href="http://community.eqo.com/blog/jeff">Jeff LaPorte</a> and <a href="http://www.mobilemuse.ca/members/dvogt">David Vogt</a>!</p>
<p>Some random points:</p>
<ul><li>I loved David's vigorous defense of Vancouver and his wonderful case for mobile innovation in Vancouver no need to move to Asia! Perhaps our <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/2907/135/">"mobile crisis" </a>is a temporary aberration as I blurted out at one point? Vancouver does have a lot going on: great educational institutions, great social and cultural scenes, great weather and great public spaces (at least in the city of Vancouver, not much in the suburbs but this will change).</li><li>The crowd at MoMoVan with a <a href="http://twitter.com/runforcover/statuses/804354218">few</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/igorskee/statuses/804955358">glaring</a> exceptions isn't really into social mobile networking. Not too much mobile real time blogging, twittering or facebooking or qik video or real time flickr-ing or whatever going on at the MoMoVan events I've attended. At least that's my sense. Prove me wrong! Twitter me (rtanglao) or leave a comment!</li><li>The crowd at MoMoVan is into the traditional one-way web and old skool two way stuff like email, IM and posting pictures in non real time. I know because I took a poll at the start of the panel</li><li>Mobile provides context</li><li>Mobile can be socially enlivening public spaces instead of distancing or cocooning</li><li>The discussion was recorded by <a href="http://brucesharpe.blogspot.com/">Bruce Sharpe</a>. Hopefully he'll post the video soon</li></ul>

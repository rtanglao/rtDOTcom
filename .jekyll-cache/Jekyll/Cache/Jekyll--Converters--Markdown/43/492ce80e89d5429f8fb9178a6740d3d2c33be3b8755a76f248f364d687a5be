I"¤<p>Ton nails it!  Read the whole thing! My blogs are definitely my communications hub.  Now need to add links to  IM, Skype, a wiki, etc. to the blog to tie them all together.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.zylstra.org/blog/archives/001297.html">Tonâ€™s Interdependent Thoughts: Blog as Personal Presence Portal</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>If no single medium can satisfy all our requirements to reach a high level of presence, that can cater for our need for discourse, than we need a mix of media to compensate for the shortcomings of any one medium in that mix. Elmine, in my view rightly, suggests that a blog is a very good starting point to present the available media mix to potential conversation and discourse partners. It serves as a fixed marker, that contains enough context to build trust and start a relationship through conversation. It also allows you to provide access to other media (e-mail, wiki, Skype, IM, video, documents etc., contact info for face to face) that can build on the conversations started at the weblog, but in themselves are more fluid which makes using them as a permanent marker less useful. Weblogs are much richer fixed markers as for instance profiles at fora, or YASN's, since they are fixed markers in location, but not fixed in content. Our weblog can serve as our Personal Presence Portal, the hub in our communicational flow.</blockquote>

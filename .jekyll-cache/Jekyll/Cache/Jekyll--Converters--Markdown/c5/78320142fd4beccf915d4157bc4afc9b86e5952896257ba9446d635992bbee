Would I tell a man to be more vocal or aggressive?
...
Am I placing unfair expectations on an introvert?
...
Is it irrefutable or actionable to tell someone 
‚ÄúYou tend to be harsh in conversation with others‚Äù?
...

more in team discussions, but I probably also want to tell others 
to interrupt less and provide alternative ways to give feedback 
on technical decisions.

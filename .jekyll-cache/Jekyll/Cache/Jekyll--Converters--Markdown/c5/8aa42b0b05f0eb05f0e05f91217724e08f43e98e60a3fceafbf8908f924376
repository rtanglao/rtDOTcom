  <li>e.g. The Shifter guy in his YouTube video:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j01meiJyLeI">Cycling Gift Guide 2025: Things I Actually Use</a> recommending the Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles. I tried to buy it and LOL they donâ€™t ship to Canada.</li>
  <li>This happens all the time. Canada  / USA free trade has always been a sham and scam. #BanMulroneyReaganEtcEtcNeverLikedThemNeverWill :-) #RealFreeTradeWithEntireWorldNotJustSuperLoopholeFilledUSMCAWithTheUSAAndMexico</li>
  <li>Having said all the above, I do like the Shifter guy, Tom Babin, and his videos :-)

  <li>November 30, 2025: <a href="https://rolandtanglao.com/2025/11/30/p0835-light-rail/">ME:: Be seen plus SEE bicycle Light Rail light from Intrinsic Cycles looks good but how do I install this on my Wald basket (the basket blocks lights mounted on the handlebar)? Not a big deal I guess Wald basket bicyclists are not mainstream yet :-) Light Rail Kit â€“ Intrinsic Cycles</a></li>

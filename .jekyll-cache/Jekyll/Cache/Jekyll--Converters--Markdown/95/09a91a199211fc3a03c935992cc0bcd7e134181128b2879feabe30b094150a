I"ß<p>Lookng forward to some practical hints and tips on multimedia blogging!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/08/03/primetime.html">Oâ€™Reilly Network: Prime-Time Hypermedia</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>In a series of columns beginning with this one, I'll review and elaborate on a variety of hypermedia techniques I've been experimenting with. I don't know beans about high-end AV technologies, so don't look for expert guidance or Hollywood production values. I come at this from the bottom up, as a web-savvy blogger frustrated by the opaqueness and intractability of existing hypermedia content. I want to be able to repurpose that stuff on my blog. I want you to be able to do the same on your blog. And I'd like to see all of our blogs enriched with original audio and video content, where appropriate. It's time to take the Web to that next level, and the means to do so are at hand.</blockquote>

I"Í<p>Interesting idea for a sustainable model for Free and Open Source Software. Not sure it would work! </p>
<p>From <a href="http://dasht-brk.livejournal.com/28304.html?mode=reply">i repeat myself when under stress (free software business model solved)</a> (<a href="http://dasht-brk.livejournal.com/28013.html?nc=1">longer form</a>):</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>When commercial software is free software -- publicly licensed -- the customer for that software can always get what they want by working with a coop or NPO. This means that the customer can always get their software by paying a fair share of the cost of development. </p> <p>It&#39;s very fine that the customer can always get the free software they need by paying a fair share of the cost of development but that is a problem for developers who want access to investment capital. A developer who wants access to investment capital must have a good chance of returning a profit -- not merely breaking even on cost of development. </p> <p>So my proposal is that some developers can be paid in shares of their customer&#39;s stock instead of cash. </p>  <p>If you issue stock, it is usually easy to grant someone else some of your stock in a way that costs you less in cash than it would cost to buy that same stock. </p>  <p>Now if a developer, paid in stock, immediately sells that stock for cash -- they earn just the cost of production but no profit on top of that. </p>  <p>On the other hand, if a developer paid in stock holds on to that stock, and the customer of the developer&#39;s program flourishes, the stock will rise in value. Later in time, the developer can sell the stock and get back the cost of development, plus interest, *plus a profit*. </p> <p>A free software developer who can make a profit that way has access to investment capital. Such a developer is truly on an equal footing with proprietary developers, from an economic perspective.</p></blockquote>

So maybe it is a symbol after all. A lasting existential consequence of pandemic fatigue is capitulation to the sentiment that there are some people who deserve to get sick, who deserve to die. At every turn, we must reject this idea as insidious, pernicious, and unforgivable. There are graceful gestures we can offer one another, no matter if we deserve them. Masking will remain a lifelong baseline priority for me for this lofty reason, among more practical considerations. Make no mistake, it would be more convenient if I never had to again. I donâ€™t cling to my boxes of N95s and often dread wearing them for long periods of time. But in the grand scheme, itâ€™s a small thing, and worth doing.</code></p>

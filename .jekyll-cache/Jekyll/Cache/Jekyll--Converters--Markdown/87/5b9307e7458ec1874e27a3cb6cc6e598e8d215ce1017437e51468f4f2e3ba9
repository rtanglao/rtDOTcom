This aim is not as ambitious as it sounds, because there is not a great deal of data publicly available.â€</li>
  <li>Juicy quote (sounds like reading <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">the whole book</a> is very worthwhile! in order to move beyond â€œanecdataâ€ :-) about software engineering to facts:
    <ul>
      <li>â€œIs software development shifting from being a sellers market to a buyers market? In a competitive market for development work and staff, paying people to learn from mistakes that have already been made by many others is an unaffordable luxury; an engineering approach, derived from evidence, is a lot more cost-effective than craft development.â€</li>
    </ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"These essays address the epistemological, aesthetic and political implications of various forms of scaling in both scholarly and artistic work. From the mass image in vernacular culture to transformations of photography in contexts of big data and artificial intelligence, they explore the massification of photography. They propose a shift into a fundamental re-evaluation of our theoretical coordinates so as to understand the underpinning media and culture of this change.""

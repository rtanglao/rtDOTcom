  <p>By my count, there are three successful types of language model product:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Chatbots like ChatGPT, which are used by hundreds of millions of people for a huge variety of tasks</li>
    <li>Completions coding products like Copilot or Cursor Tab, which are very niche but easy to get immediate value from</li>
    <li>Agentic products like Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Copilot Agent mode, which have only really started working in the last six months</li>
  </ul>

  <p>On top of that, there are two kinds of LLM-based product that donâ€™t work yet but may soon:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>LLM-generated feeds</li>
    <li>Video games that are based on AI-generated content</li>

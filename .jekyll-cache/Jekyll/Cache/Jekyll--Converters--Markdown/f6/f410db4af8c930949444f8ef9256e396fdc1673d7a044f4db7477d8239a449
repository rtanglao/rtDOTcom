  <li><a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2020/11/20/social_os">Matt Webb:Multiplayer docs, webcam fashion, noisy icons: three ideas</a>&lt;– great ideas/provocations, social “team” cursors in the OS is my  favourite: “Every application window should be thought of as a room. Tap on a window, open the door, and see cursors swarm, text get edited, and comments stream in. (Different cursors for different windows,  naturally.) And one of those team members? An artificial intelligence assistant.”</li>
  <li>And of course Matt also brings up programmable clothing like in the Three Body Problem to address the personal presentation problem in online video conferencing!</li>

<p>Not sure I understand all of <a href="http://graydon.livejournal.com/239070.html">what Graydon wrote about sub-Turing languages</a> but it seems like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"timed automata and visibly-pushdown automata" + 
"a kind of extension of interface definition languages\
 to cover (branching) sequences of permitted calls and returns." + 
"formulae in temporal logics that range over possible\
computation paths within a formal system." 
= reliable programming for many problem domains
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If it produces:</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
"a language that targets compilation into reliable components, and networks-of-components, that are guaranteed to behave well; that push general-purpose languages to the periphery of those networks, as byzantine actors."
</blockquote>

<p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

<p>then count me in ! <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/02/16/p1-dumbed-down-excel-or-1950s-r/">Because maybe then software development wouldnâ€™t be so stupid for many problem domains :-) !</a></p>

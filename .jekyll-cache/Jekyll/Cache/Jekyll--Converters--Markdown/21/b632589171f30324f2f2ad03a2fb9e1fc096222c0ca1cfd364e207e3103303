I"ê<p>Stefan - founder of 20six - want to move to all 26 countries</p>

<p>It sucks when you don‚Äôt have links, trackbacks and comments - I don‚Äôt think this is so bad. If you are writing for fame then it‚Äôs bad, if you writing  because you want to then who cares if you have any readers at all.</p>

<p>Quantity versus Quality
does that really matter?</p>

<p>Encourage Newbies
-list of new bloggers, non content based lists (faces)
-random blog function</p>

<p>Encourage Question Marks</p>

<p>Retain Champions</p>

<p>Incredibly high churn 
-8.2/10 bloggers leave after 6 months
-younger bloggers have less churn</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p>What about password protected (6A has 30% private password protected)?</p>

<p>Age of Seedbloggers</p>

<p>German has age 35 start blogger - bad start
UK 30 - medium start
Netherlands 26 - the best
France 22 - the best</p>

<p>External marketing has no impact!</p>

<p>Mobile blogging is still in its infancy</p>
<ul>
  <li>difficulty starting</li>
  <li>heavy usage in several days</li>
  <li>80% gone 
Q: is this due to tariffs?</li>
  <li>MMS/mobile email too expensive for continued usage, ok for initial</li>
</ul>

  <li>This thought has been in the back of my mind since Jul ywhen relive was cut off: Strava cutting off relive as related in <a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2019/07/strava-relive-cc-app-platform-dispute.html#comments">DC Rainmakerâ€™s Strava cuts off Relive: Hereâ€™s what actually happened</a> has happened time and time again. You canâ€™t trust a platform vendor not to revoke your API access or to remove the  APIs your software depends on on!</li>
  <li>Apple has done it umpteen times. So many time, Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s not possible to get an accurate count!</li>
  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/16/p1-remember-the-last-two-times-twitter-wrecked-their-api/">Twitter has done it a least twice.</a></li>
  <li>I still use Apple and Twitter (fortunately or unfortunately :-)</li>
  <li>I think Iâ€™ll still use Strava even with relive.cc gone. I think Iâ€™ll post to relive from Garmin but yeah it s*cks</li>

<ul>
  <li>Reuse the dataset <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/2016-r-rtgram/blob/master/JANUARY2016/january2016-ig-van-avgcolour-id-mf-month-day-daynum-unixtime-hour.csv">https://github.com/rtanglao/2016-r-rtgram/blob/master/JANUARY2016/january2016-ig-van-avgcolour-id-mf-month-day-daynum-unixtime-hour.csv</a></li>
  <li>Modify the code in  <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/2016-r-rtgram/blob/master/twenty-four-square-pie-chart-from-csv.R">https://github.com/rtanglao/2016-r-rtgram/blob/master/twenty-four-square-pie-chart-from-csv.R</a> to count the colour occurrence by hour (0-23) not the colour occurrences for the whole file</li>
  <li>i.e. in the context of the Nebraska plot the months (January-December) become the colour names (blue-black or whatever it turns out to be) and for the individual â€œmini-plotsâ€, â€œMean Temperature Fâ€ is the hours 0-23 and the Y Axis is the count for that hour instead of the count of days with that temperature</li>

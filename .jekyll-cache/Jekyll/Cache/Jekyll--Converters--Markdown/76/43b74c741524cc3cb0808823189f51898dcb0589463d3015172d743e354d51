Allow and encourage co-housing, co-ops, 4 storey low rise apartments everywhere in the city of Vancouver and multi-dwellings strata and non strata non single family homes everywhere. The government (municipal, provincial and federal all working together) must build affordable rentals and must keep the rent low and keep building affordable rentals and keep allocating them to folks working locally, the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù and private developers are incapable of doing this, follow Vienna‚Äôs example etc etc :-) ; Emilie K Adin::I Love These Streets. Come Walk with Me - Spacing Vancouver</a> &lt;‚Äì <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">While multi-family options can provide a good range of housing choices, affordability options, and some energy efficiency benefits with new construction, allowing more small-lot housing options could provide another piece of the housing puzzle.</code> &lt;‚Äì But what do I know, I am not an urban planner :-) I am also not a communist, a capitalist, a socialist, or a libertarian. I believe in all people in their amazing diversity not ideology. All people deserve affordable housing.</p>

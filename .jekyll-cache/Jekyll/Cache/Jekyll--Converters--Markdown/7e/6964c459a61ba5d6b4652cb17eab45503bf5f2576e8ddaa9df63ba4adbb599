<p>If somebody gave me an Android 4.1.2 phone thatâ€™s no longer being updated post 4.1.2. itâ€™s not a good idea to use it right? Because itâ€™s vulnerable to every major exploit discovered after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> i.e. every attack after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">4.1.2â€™s release October 2012</a> right?</p>

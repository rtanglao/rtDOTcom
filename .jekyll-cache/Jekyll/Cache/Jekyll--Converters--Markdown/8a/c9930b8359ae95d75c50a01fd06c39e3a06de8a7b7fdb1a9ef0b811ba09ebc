<blockquote>
  <p>“The president, offering no evidence, insisted upon his version of the story.”
“The president extemporized with a blithe disregard for established fact.”
“Confounding experts and antagonizing the historical record, the president painted his own, rosier portrait of events.”
“The president, perhaps inadvertently, wound up smudging the line between empirical verification and his own boundless optimism.”
“The president once again found himself galloping ahead of reality’s leisurely pace.”
“The president dabbled anew in the shallow pond of misrepresentation, filling his beak with succulent morsels hidden among the reeds.”
“The president’s most recent encounter with the specter of honesty caught him wrong-footed.”</p>

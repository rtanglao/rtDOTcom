<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>An RSS Feed is a dynamically generated summary (in XML format) of information or news published on other web sites. It is a rather simple technology that allows you, the humble web page designer, to have this content displayed in your own web page, without having to know a lick about XML!

Think of it as a box you define on your web page that is able to update itself, whenever the source of the information changes, your web page does too, without you having to do a single thing to it. Check out some of the examples where ordinary people are already using this.

This Feed2JS web site provides you a free service that can do all the hard work for you-- in 3 easy steps:

Find the RSS source, the web address for the feed.

Use our simple tool to build the JavaScript command that will display it

Optionally style it up to look pretty.</blockquote>

Educate yourself on what the TRC was and especially read the final report. 3. Have conversations with your peers and friends.  4. Have conversations with your children ( they arenâ€™t too young)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ArnallLabrador/status/1399146644806017025">5. There are children oriented resources out there to teach young children about the Residential Schools.  6. Indigenous written/ produced resources should always come first, second, or third. Our stories should always be told by our people</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ArnallLabrador/status/1399146646097772544">7. Educate yourself on proper etiquette for Indigenous allyship. This is essential. 8. Actively engage in anti racism. You see a post, you hear someone say something, you shut that down right away.  9. This all will be uncomfortable, you are unlearning unconscious biases.</a></li>
  <li><a href="">10. Lastly, listen to and uplift Indigenous voices.  You may be one person, but you can enact change with a boots on the ground mentality. It all can start with you.  A lot if this is things you can do on your own.</a></li>

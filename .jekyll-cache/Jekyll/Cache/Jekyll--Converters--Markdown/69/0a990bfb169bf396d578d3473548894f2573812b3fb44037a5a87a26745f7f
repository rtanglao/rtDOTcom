I"ë<p>I am inspired by the <a href="http://thenokiablog.com/2008/01/09/review-joby-gorillapod-with-nokia-dt-22-adapter/">Nokia Blog&#39;s N82 + Gorilla Pod post</a> to get a Gorilla Pod, attach it to my Bike with an N95 and DT-22 and do a Qik live video cast as I cycle in (maybe play some nice background music with the N81 and do some fun commentary via a bluetooth headset as well!) Anybody know where I can get a Gorilla Pod in Vancouver or do I have to resort to mail-order yet again?</p>

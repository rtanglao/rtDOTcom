Not a big deal I guess Wald basket bicyclists are not mainstream yet :-) Light Rail Kit  – Intrinsic Cycles</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Most bike lights make you choose: see or be seen. The Light Rail does both—at the same time. With two independently controlled lighting systems—one to illuminate your path and one to keep you visible to others—you get unmatched safety and control, all in one light.</code></p>

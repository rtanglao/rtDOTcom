  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/765207311291813889">A month ago </a>I met with the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens">Jens von Bergmann</a> who is the software developer behind the unofficial mobi bikes API and <a href="https://twitter.com/vb_jens/status/765207311291813889">unofficial Mobi map</a> at the fab <a href="http://revolvercoffee.ca/home/">revolver coffee</a>.</li>
  <li>We chatted about the API and broadly I think we agreed broadly on the following (in no order, Iâ€™m sure I forgot stuff!):
    <ol>
      <li>A real API is needed not the unofficial one Jens maintains through web scraping.</li>
      <li>Would be super nice to have a real-time API (assuming there is a GPS on the bicycles) showing where the bicycles are (of course all personal identifying information would be removed).</li>
      <li>Would be great to have an API to get a backup of all of my personal data that Mobi stores. (i.e. where I have been, when, how much it cost, etc etc etc).</li>
    </ol>

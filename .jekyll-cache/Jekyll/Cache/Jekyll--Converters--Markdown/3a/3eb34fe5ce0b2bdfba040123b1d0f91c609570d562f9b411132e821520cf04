<p>I believe this is a bug. I was <strong>not</strong> in a Wind Away Zone. I spent the whole day of Thursday June 17, 2010 in East Vancouver, and Gastown, all of which are in the Wind Home Zone. Anybody else experience this? Is this really a bug? I'll contact Wind support but love to hear what others have experienced.</p>

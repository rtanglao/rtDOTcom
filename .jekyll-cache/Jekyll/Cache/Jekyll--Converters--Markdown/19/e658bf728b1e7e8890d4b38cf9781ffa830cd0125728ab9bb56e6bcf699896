    <li>Put a large pan of water onto boil for the pasta. When it starts to boil add some salt and bring to the boil again.</li>
    <li>In the meantime, wash the zucchini, pat dry and cut off the ends. Cut the zucchini lengthwise in 4 parts. Cut each quarter in two and cut into cubes.</li>
    <li>Put the cream in a bowl and mix in the grated ginger, a little orange zest and some black pepper. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a little olive oil in a frying pan or skillet and add the crushed garlic cloves. As soon as the garlic begins to soften, add the zucchini and sautÃ© for a couple of minutes.</li>
    <li>As soon as the zucchini become translucent, add the smoked salmon in pieces. Remove the garlic.</li>
    <li>Cook the salmon with the zucchini for a couple of minutes then add the cream mixture.</li>
    <li>Turn down the heat, stir well and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>

Hobbes was a proponent of absolutism, the belief that the only workable alternative to anarchy â€” the natural state of human affairs â€” was to vest absolute power in a monarch; checks and balances was the argument put forth by Hobbesâ€™ younger contemporary John Locke, who believed that power should be split between an executive and legislative branch. James Madison, while writing the U.S. Constitution, adopted an evolved proposal from Charles Montesquieu that added a judicial branch as a check on the other two.</code></p>

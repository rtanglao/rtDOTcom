I"g<p>During my Python GPS experiments <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/07/06/gpsgamelanpy-ok-i-want-real-music-use-12-major-keys-with-10-chords">when I ported Matthew Brown's gamelan pygame python program to the N900's python</a> aka pyamaemo,&nbsp; found out the following which I am documenting so I won't forget:</p>
<ol><li>current version of PyMaemo is python 2.5.4</li><li>python 2.5.4 uses the Numeric floating package (<a href="https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10838">bug 1038</a>, although I think installing NumPy manually instead of waiting for python 2.6 from PyMaemo is the road to yak-shaving madness :-) ! )instead of python 2.6's NumPy</li><li>Numeric and NumPy are mostly compatible; there are very subtle differences which are easy to fix; so easy to fix that even I who know almost nothing about Python was able to fix it!</li></ol>

I"h<p><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/07/29/p1-blogthis-checkvist-list-links-to-blog/">Discovered</a>: Dec 10, 2024. 07:33 <a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region/vancouver">There is no safe crossing at 20th and Clark/Knight.  Transit app’s Vancouver bicycle directions still steer you into dangerous situations.</a> &lt;– The safe crossing is at 19th and Clark/Knight. Perhaps this is due to the database not being updated? I need to enter my safe Vancouver street crossings info (see <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2024/10/14/p2-vancouver-safe-bicycle-crossings/">Safe Vancouver Bicycle crossings</a> into Open Street Maps. Hopefully Transit app reads from Open Street Maps.</p>

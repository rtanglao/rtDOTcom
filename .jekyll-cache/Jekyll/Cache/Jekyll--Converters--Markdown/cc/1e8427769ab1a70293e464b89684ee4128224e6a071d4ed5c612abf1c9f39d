<p>Yet another reason not to buy CDs except direct from the artist.  Yes, unfortunately, the artist may be selling "DRM corrupted" :-) disks using bogus corruption schemes like MediaMax but at least you know where the money is going.
</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2004/12/24/at_the_mercy_of_the.htm">At The Mercy Of The Music Industry: Microsoft Secure WMA Files Make Music CDs Unusable - Robin Good's Latest News</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>The CDs, which use a protection system called MediaMax break away quite a bit in what you would expect from your previously bought music CDs.
</p>
<p>The scariest issue, is that there is no way for you to find out about any of this until AFTER the CD has been bought.</p>

<p>Here are some of the sacrifices you will have to make to enjoy the music on such copy-protected CDs:</p>

<p>1) If you are running Windows Media Player 7.0 or earlier you will need an open Internet connection to listen to the tracks on the CD.
</p>
<p>2) If you don't use Windows Media Player as your default media player YOU MUST be connected to the Internet to download the appropriate media license files.
</p>
<p>3) You can't download these music files to your portable media player unless it supports playback of .WMA secure files.
</p>
<p>4) Users on Mac should just give up. These tracks will not play back on the their beloved Macs if they are using Microsoft Windows Media Player 9 (the required tool).
</p>
<p>5) According to user feedback to Sunncomm download of music tracks to Sony MiniDiscs is unreliable or altogether unavailable.
</p>
<p>6) You cannot convert music tracks into other "unsecure" audio file formats like .MP3.
</p>
<p>7) In sharp contradiction with what stated on the Sunncomm FAQ it is impossible to detect a music CD protected by this system before buying it as the warning is placed on the actual CD which is not normally inspectable by consumers inside record stores.
</p>
<p>8) If you have a pop-up blocker installed on your PC expect to see a message inviting you to agree to the terms of the license followed by a black window that says "E:/index.hta"
</p>
<p>9) There is NO WAY to remove the MediaMax software from your computer once installed.
</p>
<p>10) There is NO WAY to remove the DRM digital keys, designed by Microsoft, from your computer. These keys are hidden in a secret database on the system that only Microsoft knows how to get to. According to Sunncomm "Microsoft never envisioned that anyone would have a desire to remove them."
</p>
<p>A message stating: ""this program will only work with the original CD" provides your last stare at the screen before your final scream.</p></blockquote>

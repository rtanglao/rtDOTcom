I"7<p>Thank-you <a href="http://paolo.evectors.it/">Paolo</a>. for clarifying.  You are right! It's hard to be a pioneer :-)! My thanks to you and <a href="http://matt.blogs.it/">Matt</a> for being one of the first people to actually implement this.  The "auto-suggest" tag feature in ENT/K-collector was very cool and ahead of its time.

<blockquote>But I think it's worth pointing out that our tools are analyzing your content and suggesting tags and with the current version of K-Collector they can also tag your writing automatically if you like.</blockquote>

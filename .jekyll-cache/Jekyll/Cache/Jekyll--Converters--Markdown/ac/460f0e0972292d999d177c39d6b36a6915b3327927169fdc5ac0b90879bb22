I"\<p> Glad to see that <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/tags/huginandmugin">PubSub has returned as Something Simpler</a> because I loved the technology so much that I wrote a <a href="http://www.somethingsimpler.com/">PubSub HOW TO</a> way back in November 2004! Go <a href="http://www.somethingsimpler.com/">Something Simpler</a> go! I have lots of ideas that could be implemented with their technology like &#39;searching the future for ads&#39;  (I will shortly be buying another CompactFlash card, a FireWire CF reader and a MacBook Pro and would love to get a feed of ads for these things!) </p>

In permacomputing, people are not looking for one solution, a good solution involves interactions between many things. The resilience of a garden, or a farm, is about interdependence. Companion planting is when two plants are grown near each other to benefit one of those Ã‡plants, by fending off insects, for example.....What is ideal is an ecosystem of many solutions.

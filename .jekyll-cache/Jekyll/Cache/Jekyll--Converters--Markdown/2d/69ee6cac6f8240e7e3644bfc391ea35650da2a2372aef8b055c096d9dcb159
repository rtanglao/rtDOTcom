<p>I was inspired by the crazy tall “back” portion of the <a href="http://renniecollection.org/gallery/wingsang.php">Wing Sang</a> building:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Imagine a laser cutter cutting patterns onto a giant block of wood</li>
  <li>Imagine if those patterns were programmed by an amazing “artist who does paper and other cuts” like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/RachaelAshe">Rachael Ashe</a></li>
  <li>Imagine if this laser cutter was also running an algorithm to evade a giant robot</li>
  <li>Imagine that the laser cutter would automatically stop cutting once the robot got within 2 cm</li>
  <li>Imagine if that once that happened, the block of wood was burned in a giant bon fire like the ones at crazy Burning Man</li>
  <li>As if :-)</li>
</ul>

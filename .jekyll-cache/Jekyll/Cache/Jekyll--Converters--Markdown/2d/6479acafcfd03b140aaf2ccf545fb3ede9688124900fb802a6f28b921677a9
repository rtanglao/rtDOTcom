<blockquote>

"This book will help you develop your ‚Äúdata science toolbox‚Äù, including tools such as data visualization, data formatting, data wrangling, and data modeling using regression. With these tools, you‚Äôll be able to perform the entirety of the ‚Äúdata/science pipeline‚Äù while building data communication skills (see Chapter 1.1.2 for more details). <br /> <br />

In particular, this book will lean heavily on data visualization. In today‚Äôs world, we are bombarded with graphics that attempt to convey ideas. We will explore what makes a good graphic and what the standard ways are to convey relationships with data. You‚Äôll also see the use of visualization to introduce concepts like mean, median, standard deviation, distributions, etc. In general, we‚Äôll use visualization as a way of building almost all of the ideas in this book.<br /> <br />

To impart the statistical lessons in this book, we have intentionally minimized the number of mathematical formulas used and instead have focused on developing a conceptual understanding via data visualization, statistical computing, and simulations. We hope this is a more intuitive experience than the way statistics has traditionally been taught in the past and how it is commonly perceived.<br /> <br />

Finally, you‚Äôll learn the importance of literate programming. By this we mean you‚Äôll learn how to write code that is useful not just for a computer to execute but also for readers to understand exactly what your analysis is doing and how you did it. This is part of a greater effort to encourage reproducible research..."<br /> <br />

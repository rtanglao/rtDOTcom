  <p>The researchers demonstrated this principle in an automation system called Buttons. To start out, users could move buttons around and change the text or color. Slightly further up the slope, users could edit variable values or use a toolkit to create simple UIs. Finally, at the top of the slope, users could create new behaviors by doing Lisp programming. The key point was that each customization could be done with the simplest technique possible, leaving full programming only as a last resort when absolutely needed.</p>

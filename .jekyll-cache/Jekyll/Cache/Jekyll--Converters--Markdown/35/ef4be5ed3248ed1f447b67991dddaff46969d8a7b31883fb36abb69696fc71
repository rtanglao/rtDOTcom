  <li>2/16 mean whatever they are called now :-))</li>
  <li>3/16 Anything better out there?</li>
  <li>4/16 When it comes to correlating, chopping and slicing, visualizing, calculation, aggregation, etc, it seems we are stuck with what Excel</li>
  <li>5/16 and Google Docs give us which isn‚Äôt much.</li>
  <li>6/16 Sure you can do easy charts!</li>
  <li>7/16 Sure you can combine columns and rows.</li>
  <li>8/16 But what if you want to do ‚Äúreal‚Äù programming aka something more complex encompassing both the richness of the web and the spreadsheet or</li>
  <li>9/16 document you are in?</li>
  <li>10/16 Normal folks can‚Äôt. Geeks have 8 million solutions: R Studio, Julia, Jupiter notebooks etc etc</li>
  <li>11/16 Something built on top of Google Spreadsheets with some sort of scripting language maybe? (the crazy Google Apps Script language that</li>
  <li>12/16 Google uses is silly but I‚Äôm biased)</li>
  <li>13/16 I have no idea but I think some fab creativity would be unleashed if there were a way to give more‚Äùprocedural like programming‚Äù power</li>
  <li>14/16 to the people.</li>
  <li>15/16 I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve already invented this: e.g. Xerox Parc, Smalltalk, the mother of all demos, Brett Victor‚Äôs stuff but does anybody</li>
  <li>16/16 have an affordable solution on the web I can point normal people to try today instead of some prototype or research project?</li>

I"…<p>tl;dr Please <a href="http://donate.bccancerfoundation.com/goto/roland">donate</a> to my ride up Cypress Mountain in August , the Cypress Challenge. 100% goes to Pancreatic Research.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the occasion of my birthday Iâ€™d like you to consider donating to the Cypress Challenge in honour of my mother Sofia who died of pancreatic cancer in 2013 less than week after being diagnosed . Itâ€™s a zero overhead ride so all money goes to Pancreatic Cancer research. We all have limited charity budgets and weâ€™re still living in a pandemic so if donation isnâ€™t possible, please send healing and innovation vibes to the incredible pancreatic researchers at BC Cancer (and of course Iâ€™d love some good bicycling karma for the 12km ascent to Cypress
!).</li>

  <li>Possible reasons: Fido isnâ€™t that big. the number of Samsung Note 8 users on Fido isnâ€™t that big.  Blah blah blah :-)</li>
  <li>Android security updates for the Note 8 are NOT clearly separated from carrier customizations! Which they will be with the Googleâ€™s Project Treble and newer phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Note 9 and 10 methinks?!?</li>
  <li>Previously:  <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/05/25/p1-maybe-it-is-not-samsung-but-fido-that-is-delaying-note8-monthly-security-updates/">Maybe Fido is delaying Samsung Note 8 Updates not  Samsung (since Note 8 is on the list of phones that get a monthly  update and the Samsung S10 got an update already)?</a></li>

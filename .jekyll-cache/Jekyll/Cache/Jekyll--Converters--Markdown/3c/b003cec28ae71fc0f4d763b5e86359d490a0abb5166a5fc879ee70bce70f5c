  <li>I disagree with: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-most-important-self-driving-car-announcement-yet/556712/">â€˜Alexis Madrigal:The Atlantic:The Most Important Self-Driving Car Announcement Yetâ€“Autonomous vehicles will transform urban life by 2020, if Waymoâ€™s time line is correctâ€™</a>! Especially words like:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

"But the qualitative impact will be even bigger. Right now, maybe 10,000 or 20,000 people have ever ridden in a self-driving car, in any context. Far fewer have been in a vehicle that is truly absent a driver. Up to a million people could have that experience every day in 2020.<br /><br />

2020 is not some distant number. Itâ€™s hardly even a projection. By laying out this time line yesterday, Waymo is telling the world: Get ready, this is really happening. This is autonomous driving at scale, and not in five years or 10 years or 50 years, but in two years or less."

  <li>Yes, it will transform dense urban core life by 2029 <strong>not 2020</strong> but it wonâ€™t transform the suburbs and rural places!</li>
  <li>In other words, I stand by my previous post: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/04/01/p1-probably-wrong-2029-prediction-no-self-driving-cars-outside-city-cores/">â€˜Probably Wrong 2029 Prediction :-) : No self-driving cars and vehicles outside city coresâ€™</a></li>

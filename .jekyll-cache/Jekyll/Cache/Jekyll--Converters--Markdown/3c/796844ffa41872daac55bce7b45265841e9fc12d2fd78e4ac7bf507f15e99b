But how general is it? And I agree, where do we go from here? Still skeptical but super thought provoking piece ; Robin Sloan:: AGI is here (and I feel fine)</a></p>

  <p>Itâ€™s not that the comÂ­paÂ­nies donâ€™t know anyÂ­thingâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey know a lotâ€”but rather that a regÂ­ular user can have an expeÂ­riÂ­ence with these sysÂ­tems, an idea about them, that is not availÂ­able to even the deepest, dankest, insider-iest insider.â€‚I contend that regÂ­ular users are having such expeÂ­riÂ­ences &amp; ideas all the time.</p>

  <p>I think this is just how these sysÂ­tems work, when they have so many difÂ­ferent people using them for so many difÂ­ferent reaÂ­sons.â€‚Itâ€™s pretty weird, comÂ­pared to other products.â€‚After all, the comÂ­pany that manÂ­uÂ­facÂ­tures jet engines &amp; sells them to five cusÂ­tomers can reaÂ­sonÂ­ably claim to underÂ­stand the uses of those engines.</p>

  <p>Thatâ€™s all to say, for all the math &amp; matÃ©riel involved in their care &amp; feeding, the big models are more like Twitter than they are like jet engines, &amp; this whole thing was a surÂ­prise anywayâ€Šâ€”â€Šfrom which no one has quite recoveredâ€Šâ€”â€Šso I will defend vigÂ­orÂ­ously the right of anyÂ­body/everyÂ­body to reflect &amp; opine on AIâ€™s propÂ­erÂ­ties &amp; potential, &amp; to declare, when it seems obvious: AGI is here.</p>

  <p>Recently, I have been reading a lot about the early hisÂ­tory of perÂ­sonal comÂ­puters, the 1970s &amp; 1980s. (This book was wonderful, because its presentâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe pinÂ­nacle from which it surÂ­veys a tumulÂ­tuous hisÂ­toryâ€Šâ€”â€Šisâ€‰â€¦â€‰1984.) Itâ€™s been interÂ­esting to disÂ­cover that many of the visions &amp; promises of that era â€œrhymeâ€ with the visions &amp; promises of the present boom.â€‚Itâ€™s clear that Bay Area tech is, if not one conÂ­tinÂ­uous project, 1957-2026, then for sure one conÂ­tinÂ­uous culture. (I happen to think itâ€™s one conÂ­tinÂ­uous project.)</p>

  <p>The pace is familiar, too: hot new comÂ­paÂ­nies were appearing every month, fading just as fast.â€‚Yes, the dollar amounts were smallerâ€Šâ€”â€Šthe comÂ­puter was still a niche productâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut the feelÂ­ings really seem to be the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Andâ€‰â€¦â€‰the visions of that era were subÂ­stanÂ­tially realizedâ€Š!â€‚Today, everyÂ­body really does own a perÂ­sonal comÂ­puter, or someÂ­thing like one.â€‚Everybody really is conÂ­nected to a global inforÂ­maÂ­tion network, or someÂ­thing like one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m an avid user of both my perÂ­sonal comÂ­puter &amp; the global inforÂ­maÂ­tion network, &amp; I observe that we appear not to live in utopia.â€‚The andâ€‰â€¦â€‰? of those invenÂ­tions roars in our ears.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, everyÂ­body really can call upon AGI, or someÂ­thing like it: a wildly genÂ­eral comÂ­puter program.â€‚I meanâ€Š!â€‚Wow!</p>

  <p>The quesÂ­tion, always, forever: what now?</p>

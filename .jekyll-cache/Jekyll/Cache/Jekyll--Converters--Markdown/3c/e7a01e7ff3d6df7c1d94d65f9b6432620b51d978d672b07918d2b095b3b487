<blockquote> Have you ever wanted to know how you can create your own video hosting site allowing users to upload video, automatically convert it to FLV, and display it for the world to see? A recent post at Daniel&#39;s Random Mutterings (DRM - how clever) explains exactly how to do this with open source tools. Using a Djano CMS system, FFMpeg for the FLV encoding, FLVtools2 for writing meta information, and FlowPlayer for embedding the SWF file you&#39;ll have everything you need to get started. The code is pretty straight forward and a great starting point. Now go forth and create your new video distribution empire. </blockquote>

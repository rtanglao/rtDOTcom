In fact, waffle charts are sometimes lovingly referred to as “square pie charts”....One of the major advantages of waffle charts over pie charts is the absence of ambiguity....Waffle charts are displayed in discrete blocks. Pie charts on the other hand are displayed in wedges, which can sometimes be difficult for the human eye to discern scale and proportions</code></p>

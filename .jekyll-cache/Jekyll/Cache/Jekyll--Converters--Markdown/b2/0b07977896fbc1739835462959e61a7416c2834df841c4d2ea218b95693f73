Instead, our adaptation is more like a broken zipper, with some teeth that align and others that gape apart. The paleontologist Neal Shubin points out that our inner fish constrains the human bodyâ€™s performance and health, because adaptations that arose in one environment bedevil us in another. Hiccups, hernias and hemorrhoids are all caused by an imperfect transfer of anatomical technology from our fish ancestors.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t to say that we wouldnâ€™t be better off eating fewer processed foods. And certainly we have health concerns that never struck our ancestors. But we shouldnâ€™t flagellate ourselves for having modern bodies, and we shouldnâ€™t assume that tweaking our diets or our posture will rescue us from all our current ills. Thatâ€™s just a paleofantasy about the future. `</p>

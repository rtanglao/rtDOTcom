I"N<p> The <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/cellphones/blackberry-pearl-8100-officially-shot-out-of-a-cannon-198992.php">BlackBerry Pearl</a>  (linking to gizmodo because it&#39;s more informative! ) was launched today complete with a 1.3 megapixel camera.I am sure the email features are great. And the web browser is passable (Opera and the Nokia browser are better I bet). </p>
<p>  I am sure the Pearl will be a hit for normal people.  </p>
<p> Lots of questions (<a href="http://www.blackberrypearl.com/h-function.jsp">the official Blackberry Pearl site</a> s*cks! Why doesn&#39;t it have a proper specs page?): Does <a href="http://www.shozu.com/portal/">ShoZu</a> run on it? Does it run Java? If it does, I assume ShoZu could be easily ported. How good are the photos? I bet they s*ck compared to a modern cameraphones like the N70, N73 and Sony Ericsson 750, 810, etc. </p>
<p> All in all a fine device for the masses it would appear (I haven&#39;t tried it). </p>
<p> However for mobile cameraphone early adopters like myself it needs to have a modern camera and ShoZu support and WiFi (most people can&#39;t afford to upload more than a handful of photos a month over GPRS or 3G!) before it is compelling enough to buy or want.  </p>
<p> I am sure these feature upgrades will happen over time. Until then I am quite happy with Nokia (Nokia add one your great 2 megapixel cameras to the <a href="http://darlamack.blogs.com/darlamack/2006/09/rogers_launches.html">E62</a> and put back WiFi and you will have a device that is much better than the Pearl!). Vive la competition! Go RIM and Nokia go! </p>

When does it end? 2025? 2030? I say 2030! <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">When I first tried ChatGPT, it blew my mind. Its ability to respond intelligently to almost any prompt I gave it was astonishing, it was obvious to me it was the future. It seemed like weâ€™d finally built the kind of AI weâ€™ve all seen in the movies. Over time though, one big limitation became clear â€“ theyâ€™re all talk and no action. By that I mean theyâ€™re fantastic for anything that requires generating text, but persuading them to make something happen is a lot harder. For example, we can now build a model that could have a natural conversation with a person, just like HAL 9000, but if you ask it to open the pod bay doors, thereâ€™s no easy way to connect the LLMâ€™s output to those doorsâ€™ controls. ... The challenge of converting something somebody said into an action is known as the â€œspeech to intentâ€ problem in the research world. ... This is why Iâ€™m so excited to be working on this problem. Weâ€™ve been suffering through a long voice interface winter, but almost all of the ingredients are in place to make speech work. If we can persuade LLMs to turn their words into deeds, then weâ€™ll be finally be able to talk to machines like we can to people, and I think that will be glorious.</code></p>

    <p>Discovered Jul 28, 2021. Tim Harford (via Simon Willison) The Tyranny of Spreadsheets &lt;— don’t use them in life and death situations &lt;— “When used by a trained accountant to carry out double-entry bookkeeping, a long-established system with inbuilt error detection, Excel is a perfectly professional tool. But when pressed into service by genetics researchers or contact tracers, it’s like using your Swiss Army Knife to fit a kitchen because it’s the tool you have closest at hand. Not impossible, but hardly advisable.` 
AND</p>

    <p>“<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fetzer and Graeber have calculated a conservative estimate of the number of people who died, unknown victims of the spreadsheet error. They think the death toll is at least 1,500 people.</code>”
125000 infections means 1500 people died because of a spreadsheet?!?</p>

    <p>I think the real moral of the story here is not to use anything in production without tests or some sort of inbuilt error detection.</p>

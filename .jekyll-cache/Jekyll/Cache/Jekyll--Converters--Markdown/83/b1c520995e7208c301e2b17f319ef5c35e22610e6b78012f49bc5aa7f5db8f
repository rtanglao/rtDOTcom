  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots” is not a write-up of original research. It’s a synthesis of LLM critiques that Bender and others have made: of the biases encoded in the models; the near impossibility of studying what’s in the training data, given the fact they can contain billions of words; the costs to the climate; the problems with building technology that freezes language in time and thus locks in the problems of the past.</code> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">Please read the whole thing: You Are Not a Parrot And a chatbot is not a human. And a linguist named Emily M. Bender is very worried what will happen when we forget this.</a></li>
  <li>Judith Butler, UC Berkley: “Or that human potential — that’s the fascist idea — human potential is more fully actualized with AI than without it”. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbots-emily-m-bender.html">AGAIN :-), please read the whole thing</a></li>

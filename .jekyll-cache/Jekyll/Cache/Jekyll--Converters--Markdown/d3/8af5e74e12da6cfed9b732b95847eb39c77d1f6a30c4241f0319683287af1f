<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Coding isnâ€™t the only job that demands intense focus. 
But youâ€™d never hear someone say that brain surgery is 
â€˜funâ€™, or that structural engineering is â€˜easyâ€™. When 
it comes to programming, why do policymakers and 
technologists pretend otherwise?

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>In an ever-more intricate and connected world, where 
software plays a larger and larger role in everyday 
life, itâ€™s irresponsible to speak of coding as a 
lightweight activity. Software is not simply lines of 
code, nor is it blandly technical. In just a few years, 
understanding programming will be an indispensable 
part of active citizenship. The idea that coding 
offers an unproblematic path to social progress 
and personal enhancement works to the advantage 
of the growing techno-plutocracy thatâ€™s insulating 
itself behind its own technology.

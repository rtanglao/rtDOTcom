November 2004 –&gt;QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">This is a revised edition (because PubSub has made it easier than ever to subscribe) of part 1 of my guide called The Lazy Person's Guide to being an NewsMaster (here's the original edition of The Lazy Person's Guide to being an NewsMaster Part 1) . What is a NewsMaster? Robin Good (as far as I know) defined the term in his excellent post, The RSS NewsMaster as RSS Dolby. I would generalize this further and define them as Internet Dolby. That is, NewsMasters sift through the web, remove the noise and reveal what is pertinent and relevant to you and your organizations.</code></p>

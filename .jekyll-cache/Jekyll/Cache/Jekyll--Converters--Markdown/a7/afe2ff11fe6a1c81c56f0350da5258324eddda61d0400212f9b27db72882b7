The audacious task is to collectively learn how to relate to the world differently and better, and that includes reckoning with existing patterns of power that perpetuate existing patterns of attending, understanding, and valuing. My recent talk at UCL Centre for Global Governance developed these ideas (see the slides at the bottom of this post) and metacrisis carries them better than any other single term.</code></p>

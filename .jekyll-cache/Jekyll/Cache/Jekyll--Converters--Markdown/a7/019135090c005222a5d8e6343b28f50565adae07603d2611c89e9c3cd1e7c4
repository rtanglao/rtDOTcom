<ul>
  <li>Remember when Lightroom was new and fast and it didn’t require a $USD5900 Windows machine (source: <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/building-a-windows-10-lightroom-photo-editing-pc/#full_parts_list">Paul Stamatiou @Stammy’s Building a Lightroom PC</a>) to run it fast for ‘hobbyist’ photographers? Neither do I :-)</li>
  <li>Time to switch to Lightroom CC or something much faster on mobile :-)</li>
  <li>Moral of the story: All software needs to be ruthlessly refactored eventually i.e. we all build big balls of mud :-) or something!</li>
  <li>By making RAW files too big and not doing any sort of in-camera or send to iOS and Android workflows, digital camera companies aren’t doing ‘hobbyists’ any favours to make our workflow fast, convenient and fun.</li>

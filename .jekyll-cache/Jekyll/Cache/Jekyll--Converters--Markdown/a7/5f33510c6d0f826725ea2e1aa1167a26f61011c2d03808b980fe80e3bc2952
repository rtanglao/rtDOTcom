<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
If you have both a lot of knowledge and a useful framework, you will  be a true thought leader. Others will follow you. They will add to your  knowledge. They will debate you and through those debates, we will all  acquire a deeper understanding. And, if you are committed and humble  enough to keep learning, you will extend your own framework with what  you continue to learn. This is genuinely fulfilling.<br /><br />

So gather  knowledge and find ways to structure it. Work on the big idea and the  framework that goes with it. Because, when it comes to leading people to  think better and know more, thatâ€™s crucial.<br /><br />

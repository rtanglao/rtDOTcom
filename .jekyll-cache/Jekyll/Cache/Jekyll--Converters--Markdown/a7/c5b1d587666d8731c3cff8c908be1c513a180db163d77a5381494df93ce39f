RTWT! â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">And this "it's just me" attitude is often encouraged -- when I write about finding things hard to learn on the Internet, Internet strangers will sometimes tell me: "yeah, this is easy! You should get it already! Maybe you're just not very smart!" ... But luckily I have a pretty big ego so I don't take the internet strangers too seriously. And I have a lot of patience so I'm willing to keep coming back to a topic I'm confused about. There were maybe four different things that were going wrong with DNS in my life and eventually I figured them all out. </code></p>

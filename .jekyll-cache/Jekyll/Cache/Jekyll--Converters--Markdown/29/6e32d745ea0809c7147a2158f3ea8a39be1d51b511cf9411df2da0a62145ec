"
cURL all those 455 pages as JPG (curl -O url[1-455].jpg ), collate
into 1 file and print as PDF using Mac's Preview. Hey presto, full PDF
on my local drive. Total time: under 3 minutes, less than it would
take to create an account, wait for confirmation and then download
just so they have your e-mail address. (which would be a 1-time
address from me anyway) With time to spare to post the process to FB"

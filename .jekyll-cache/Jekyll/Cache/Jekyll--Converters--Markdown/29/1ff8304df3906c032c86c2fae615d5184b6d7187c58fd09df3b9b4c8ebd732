I"4<p>The subject says it all.The low light, HDR and Fcamera apps of <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2010/07/21/fcam-unleashed-for-the-nokia-n900/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NokiaConversations-Posts+%28Nokia+Conversations+-+Posts%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">FCam</a> (<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2010/07/22/n900-finally-gets-some-fun-photo-apps">my FCam post</a>) are great but I can't use them because there's no GPS in the EXIF or camera info in the EXIF. So great experimental stuff but not suitable for my daily use.</p>
<p>The final cool thing to report is that it doesn't stop the music player&nbsp; from playing music unlike the N900 built-in camera app. Wish I had time and a Windoze box to hack the source code to fix the EXIF issues and add GPS.</p>

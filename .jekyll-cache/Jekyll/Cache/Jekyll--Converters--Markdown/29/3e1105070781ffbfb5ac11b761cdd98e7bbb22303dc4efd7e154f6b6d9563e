</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote about the new GLM-4.5 model family yesterday‚Äînew open weight (MIT licensed) models from Z.ai in China which their benchmarks claim score highly in coding even against models such as Claude Sonnet 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The models are pretty big‚Äîthe smaller GLM-4.5 Air model is still 106 billion total parameters, which is 205.78GB on Hugging Face.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ivan Fioravanti built this 44GB 3bit quantized version for MLX, specifically sized so people with 64GB machines could have a chance of running it. I tried it out‚Ä¶ and it works extremely well.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I fed it the following prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write an HTML and JavaScript page implementing space invaders</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And it churned away for a while and produced the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clearly this isn‚Äôt a particularly novel example, but I still think it‚Äôs noteworthy that a model running on my 2.5 year old laptop (a 64GB MacBook Pro M2) is able to produce code like this‚Äîespecially code that worked first time with no further edits needed.</p>

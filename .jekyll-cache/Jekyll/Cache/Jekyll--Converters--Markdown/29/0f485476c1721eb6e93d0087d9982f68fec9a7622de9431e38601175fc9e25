I"”<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: check out the <a href="http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2007/09/activestate-ann.html">official Open Komodo blog post</a> from ActiveState]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got an advance briefing about <a href="http://www.activestate.com/openkomodo">Open Komodo</a> (initially a portion of <a href="http://activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/">Komodo Edit</a> combined with other open source goodies) which is an open source client side (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) web application development platform from our friends at <a href="http://activestate.com/">ActiveState</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. Add debugging and PHP support (hopefully soon, LazyWeb ?!?) and you have a killer open source Drupal development environment as well as one for XUL based Rich Internet Apps and CSS/HTML/JavaScript Web Apps (e.g. iPhone apps). Can&#39;t wait to try it and see how it evolves!</p>

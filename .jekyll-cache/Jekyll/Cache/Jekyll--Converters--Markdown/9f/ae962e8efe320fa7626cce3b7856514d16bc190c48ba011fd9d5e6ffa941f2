    <p>â€œMachine learning engineering is becoming a real ecosystem</p>

    <p>Looking at software engineering as a parallel, we typically see ecosystems â€œmatureâ€ in pretty standard patterns.</p>

    <p>A new programming language will emerge with some exciting features, and  people will use it for specialized use-cases, research projects, and  toys. At this stage, anyone who uses it has to build all their basic  utilities from scratch.</p>

    <p>Down the line, people within the community develop libraries and projects  that abstract common utilities away, until the tooling is capable and  stable enough to be used in production.</p>

    <p>â€¦</p>

    <p>In this approach, a team takes a pre-trained model and removes/retrains  the last layers of the model to focus on a new, related task.</p>

    <p>I think it is and it isnâ€™t. It is but as a newbie there are far too many choices. Hard to figure out where to start!</p>

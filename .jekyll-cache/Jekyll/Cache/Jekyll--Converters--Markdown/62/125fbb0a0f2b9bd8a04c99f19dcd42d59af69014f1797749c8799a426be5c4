  <li>The iPhone changed the world: <a href="https://twitter.com/rhh/status/818609069237760001">“There would be no Trump presidency” without it!”</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2007/12/13/rolands-christmas-2007-social-geek-gadget-list/">What I wrote about the original iPhone</a>:</li>

"lousy pictures but the most usable phone the world has ever seen for SMS, web browser for twitter, utterz, jaiku, etc." and this was before apps!"

  <li><a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2007/01/14/iphone-and-n999-i-want-both/">My first iPhone post on January 14, 2007</a> (it turns out that the whole Symbian user experience was unacceptable when compared to iPhone):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
"Thank-goodness for Apple! Now we wil get some innovation in the mobile space. Series 60 and Symbian OS really need some re-thinking in terms of usability and needs to get more stable. Even with just the built-in software, I regularly have to reboot my N93 and the other Series 60 Symbian devices I get for free trial from Nokia Blogger Relations; this is unacceptable!"
&lt;/blockuote&gt;

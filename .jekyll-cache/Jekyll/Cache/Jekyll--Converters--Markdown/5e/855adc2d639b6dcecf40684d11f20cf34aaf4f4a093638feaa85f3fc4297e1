But I’ve found it again, and there’s been an open issue, and I’ve been able to pick up work again.</code> &lt;– lLve this issue driven approach, maybe i should adopt this for my personal hobbyist projects !!!! Seems like a lot of common sense that would apply to work software project, in particular failing tests if the docs aren’t written!</li>

<p>First of all, I have to say that I love pearla and will give it a 5 star review. LUTs for me are much more fun than filters. Also I don’t do video just stills and it works great. So I am not going to comment on video stuff :-)</p>

<h2 id="pearla-bugs">Pearla bugs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Viewfinder freeze still happens when loading certain LUTs and most LUTs over 1MB e.g.  <a href="https://marcrphoto.wordpress.com/2022/11/18/new-lut-update-picturefx-leica-barnack-based-on-leica-type-ii-iii-35mm-film-camera/">PictureFX-Leica-Barnack-125.cube from marcrphoto</a></li>
  <li>GPS tagging doesn’t work on my iPhone 16 Pro Max with the latest version of iOS</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pearla-feature-request">Pearla feature request</h2>

<ul>
  <li>a UX affordance e.g. button  to quickly switch between LUTs. Having to go to the settings works but is slow.</li>
  <li>Would be nice: a way to rename LUTs</li>
</ul>

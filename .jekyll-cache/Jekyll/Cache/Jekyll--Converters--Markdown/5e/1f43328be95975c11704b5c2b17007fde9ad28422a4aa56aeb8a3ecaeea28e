I worked several security problems using multi-agent frameworks like Autogen and CrewAI in the past, but for this, I felt the OpenAI Assistants API was the best choice, plus despite knowing all of the features, I had not built anything with it yet. As I did with the first app, I used O1 to help me out. This time, I took a staged approach where I first formed a basic chat application that used the API and then moved to merge the Fellow library capabilities. Within three hours, I had a completed assistant capable of scraping coffee websites, forming recipes and sending them to the machine. </code> &lt;– includes <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/679af023-81f4-800e-954c-314836faa2fd?ref=applied-gai-in-security.ghost.io">an example prompt generate an Aiden pourover coffee recipe</a></p>

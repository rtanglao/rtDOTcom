<p>I have roughly 3 million thumbnails and the likes and the comments and the other metadata from instagram 2014-2016. How should I train a neural network? Using weights such as: for the the likes (weight 0.5), comments (weight 1.0). And then using the network to pick which photos to post? Or should I train a neural net using some other metadata?</p>

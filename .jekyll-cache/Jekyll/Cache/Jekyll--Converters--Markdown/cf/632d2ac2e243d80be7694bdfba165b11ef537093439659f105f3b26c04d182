  <li>Just pour le fun :-)</li>
  <li>Always carry a plastic bag so you can have your coffee in the rain.</li>
  <li>Seriously itâ€™s not that bad, thereâ€™s always some shade somewhere and if you rain gear and your back side is dry courtesy of the plastic bag, itâ€™s fun to drink your coffee and eat your doughnut in the rain! And in COVID times thereâ€™s the bonus advantage of nobody else doing it :-) !</li>

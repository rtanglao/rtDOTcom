</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>This repo is designed to teach SuperCollider to beginners through two self-styled tutorials that I've designed. The theme of these workshops is ambulation - getting you to take your first steps to walk on your own with SuperCollider. Both are offered as workshops at Music Hackspace but all the materials are included here and can be used as a self-guided workshop as well.

What is SuperCollider? SuperCollider is a free platform for audio synthesis and algorithm composition. It really excels at real-time analysis, synthesis, sampling, and processing and provides a framework for seamless combination of audio techniques like additive and subtractive synthesis

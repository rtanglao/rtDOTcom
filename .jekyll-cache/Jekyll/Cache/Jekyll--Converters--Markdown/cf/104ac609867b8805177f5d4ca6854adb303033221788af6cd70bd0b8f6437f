I"a<p>Great vision update.  The blogosphere is a very crude prototype for the Global Mind and Global brain.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/04/new_version_of_.html">Minding the Planet: New Version of My “Metaweb” Graph – The Future of the Net</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>As structures that provide virtual higher-order cognition and self-awareness to the network emerge, connect to one another, and gain sophistication, the Global Brain will self-organize into a Global Mind -- the intelligence of the whole will begin to outpace the intelligence of any of its parts and thus it will cross the threshold from being just a "bunch of interacting parts" to "a new higher-order whole" in its own right -- a global intelligent Metaweb for our planet.</blockquote>

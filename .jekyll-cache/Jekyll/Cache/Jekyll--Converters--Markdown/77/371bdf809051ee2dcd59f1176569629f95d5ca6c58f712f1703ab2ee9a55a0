<ul>
  <li>Serious and honestly not really a work related question:
    <ul>
      <li>How difficult is it to write an Android app that works with Android 4.1, 5, 6,7, 8 and the Android 9 which will be released by September?</li>
      <li>Is it better to write multiple apps, e.g. one for 4.1 and one for 5,6 and one for 7, 8 and 9?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How much Android functionality do you lose as you move from Android 9 down to 4.1?</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve been supporting Android apps since 2012 so I know the answers to most of the above questions, but maybe thereâ€™s somebody out there who can give me a 2018 answer.</li>
</ul>

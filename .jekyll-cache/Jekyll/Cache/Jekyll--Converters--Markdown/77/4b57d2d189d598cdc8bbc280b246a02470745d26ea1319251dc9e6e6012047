<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe president remained steadfast in his novel interpretation of constitutional law.â€
â€œFaced with the choice between clinging to the letter of the law and marching to the beat of his own legal drum, the president chose the latter.â€
â€œThe presidentâ€™s solutions-focused approach to legal roadblocks necessitated thinking outside the constitutional box.â€

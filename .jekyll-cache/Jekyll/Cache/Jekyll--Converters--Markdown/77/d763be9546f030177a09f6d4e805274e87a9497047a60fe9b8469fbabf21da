I"Y<p> I&#39;m at Vancouver waiting for my (delayed) flight to San Francisco for <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/">BloggerCon IV</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampSanFrancisco">BarCamp San Francisco</a> and my sleep deprived brain is reflecting nostalgically on previous BloggerCons especially the first one back in October 2003 in Boston: </p>
<ul> <li>2003 seems so far away. Much has changed and much has stayed the same. But one thing seems to be constant. Almost everybody I met at BloggerCon I way back :-) in 2003 have profited in some way indirectly (not usually directly) from their blog.</li> <li>I remember being in a cab with <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="http://blaserco.com/blogs/">Britt Blaser</a> and <a href="http://sf.backfence.com/news/newsList.cfm?myComm=PA&amp;tid=51">Dan Gillmor</a> and speaking with the cabbie on why he was voting Republican. It was then (in a rare feat of prescience) that I knew that the 2004 election was lost for the Democrats.</li> <li> Speaking of Britt, I sure wish he could make it to BloggerCon IV. But I bet he&#39;s busy with <a href="http://www.openresourcegroup.com/">Orgware</a> and <a href="http://www.podslam.org/home">Podslam</a> and his other ventures after an all too brief vacation in Ireland</li> <li>I remember meeting <a href="http://accordionguy.blogware.com/">Joey</a> (love to hear that accordion belting out Iko Iko Friday and Saturday but alas he&#39;s not coming) and <a href="http://redhead.blogware.com/">Wendy</a> (who did a stellar job of organizing the first BloggerCon) and sharing Indian food with them and Dave and many others and now they are married and live in Toronto.</li> <li>Had great conversations with <a href="http://susanmernit.blogspot.com/">Susan Mernit</a>, <a href="http://blog.deeje.tv/musings/">Deeje Cooley</a> and <a href="http://fuzzyblog.com/">Scott Johnson</a> over Indian food.</li> <li>Met the proud papa, wine lover med musings guy <a href="http://www.enochchoi.com/thoughts/">Enoch Choi</a> who the kid, Barb and I had the pleasure of lunching with and his family at BloggerCon III.</li> </ul>

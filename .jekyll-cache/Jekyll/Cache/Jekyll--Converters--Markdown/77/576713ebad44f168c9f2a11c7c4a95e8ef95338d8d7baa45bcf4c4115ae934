  <li>Crazy claim: you have to go through a Newton / Symbian-like era before you get an iPhone-like polished-usable-by-human experience</li>
  <li>And thatâ€™s what will happen with AR, VR and MR in 2017: nothing polished, some superb stuff but in the same way ShoZu was superb before Flickr and instagram  and in the same way qik was awesome before Facebook live and twitch.tv: only appeals to a few early adopters who donâ€™t mind the jank and the rough edges</li>
  <li>2018 will be great though: I figure SnapChat will do something cool in AR/MR/VR though but I definitely do want those SnapChat $USD130 glasses in 2017 :-) !!!!!!</li>

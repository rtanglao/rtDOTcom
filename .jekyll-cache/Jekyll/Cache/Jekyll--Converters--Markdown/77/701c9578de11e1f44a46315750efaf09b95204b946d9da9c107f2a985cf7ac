Whatever. Maybe clean a database that sometimes gets in a weird state, and (of course) thereâ€™s no time to debug the application that causes the problem and fix it, because the one guy that developed it left three years ago. Maybe itâ€™s a daily report. Maybe itâ€™s the daily restart of that server that after a couple of days of continuous operation gets unbearably slow. Maybe it asks you for a clientâ€™s phone and then prints out all of their contact information, to be used by your customer service team when needing to call a customer. Maybe it receives a (former) employeeâ€™s email and then ensures that he has no account on any of several SaaS platforms that your company uses (because of course you do, and they arenâ€™t all tied together to Okta). Maybe it receives an Excel file that has former employeesâ€™ emails and, for each one, does the things listed in the script just before. And so on. Youâ€™ll know when you have scripts to take care of.</code></p>

  <p>Whatâ€™s missing is a global framework for identifying where these efforts will make the biggest difference right now. We call this the Marginal Tipping Map.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Marginal Tipping Map is not yet a finished toolâ€”it is a proposed framework, a way of thinking that enables more effective action. It is designed to help funders, governments, and institutions see where catalytic investments, policy shifts, and social momentum can unlock exponential change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isnâ€™t just about dataâ€”itâ€™s about shifting strategy: from allocating cost to identifying leverage. From asking who should act, to revealing where action will move the most.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Solar costs fell 89% in a decade due to scale and learning.</li>
    <li>Norwayâ€™s EV adoption crossed 80% with clear public signals.</li>
    <li>The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act triggered hundreds of billions in private investment.</li>
    <li>Vietnam and Germany launched solar booms with targeted policy shifts.</li>
  </ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>These tipping points didnâ€™t happen by accident. They were enabled. The question is how to identify and trigger the next onesâ€”globally</p>

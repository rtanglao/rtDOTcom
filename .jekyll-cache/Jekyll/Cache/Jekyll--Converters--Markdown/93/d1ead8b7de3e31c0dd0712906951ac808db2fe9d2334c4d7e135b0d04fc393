It Looks Bleak. - The New York Times</a> &lt;â€” eerily inert is what i see when is see â€œAIâ€  generated images.  â€œEerily Inert LLM contentâ€ is my next indie band :-) â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>:<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iâ€™ve seen numerous people describe how genuinely moved they were by listening to â€œNow and Then.â€ I believe them. And the experience of communing with lost friends and collaborators was obviously an especially meaningful one for McCartney. For me, though, the song is eerily inert. Lennonâ€™s original shoddy demo, long available online, is, by contrast, movingly alive, not despite but because of its incompleteness. The recording generates an aura of possibility that fits with the songâ€™s themes: all that might have been, the power of what endures over time, even as so much else erodes. It reminds me of the Beatles without sounding like the Beatles â€” and why should it, when Lennon didnâ€™t write it for them? The new â€œNow and Then,â€ for which some of Lennonâ€™s original lyrics were cut and others rearranged, doesnâ€™t entirely sound like the Beatles either, no matter how much it wants to. The image that formed in my mind as I listened and relistened was that of a spotless, echoey mausoleum, built from shiny gray marble and haunted by garbled digital cries that sound like people I once knew, trying to connect across impossible distances.</code></p>

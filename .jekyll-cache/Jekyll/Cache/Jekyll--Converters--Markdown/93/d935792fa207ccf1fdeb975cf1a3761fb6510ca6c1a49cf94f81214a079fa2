  <p>It‚Äôs all special pleading anyways. LLMs digest code further than you do. If you don‚Äôt believe a typeface designer can stake a moral claim on the terminals and counters of a letterform, you sure as hell can‚Äôt be possessive about a red-black tree. ‚Ä¶ When I started writing a couple days ago, I wrote a section to ‚Äúlevel set‚Äù to the state of the art of LLM-assisted programming. A bluefish filet has a longer shelf life than an LLM take. In the time it took you to read this, everything changed.</p>

  <p>Kids today don‚Äôt just use agents; they use asynchronous agents. They wake up, free-associate 13 different things for their LLMs to work on, make coffee, fill out a TPS report, drive to the Mars Cheese Castle, and then check their notifications. They‚Äôve got 13 PRs to review. Three get tossed and re-prompted. Five of them get the same feedback a junior dev gets. And five get merged</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Eventually all of these will come together in a super-script that parses all available data in every page you ever browse, and publishes it to your own private Atom Store via the Atom API. (This part is already written as well, though unreleased.)</p>
 <p>Imagine having your own private database of every person you've ever stumbled across online, and being able to download their vCards into your address book. And every event, which you can download into iCal/Sunbird/Outlook. Plus a list of all the Creative Commons-licensed content you've ever read, which you can repurpose -- legally, according to the terms of the license. 
</p><p>Now imagine searching such a database. And subscribing to your search results as a syndicated feed. 
</p><p>It's coming. Within weeks, not years. All the data is out there; people are publishing this stuff anyway. If they publish it just 1% better (with appropriate microformatting), I can get 1000% more out of it.</p></blockquote>

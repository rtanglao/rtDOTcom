<p>This worked perfectly tonight with my Canon S400. Be careful to disassemble the bare minimum necessary. If you see a spring popping up, you are disassembling too much. The <a href="http://www.huroncamera.com/diagrams/Canon_Digital/POWERSHOT_S400_IXUS_400.pdf">PDF</a> is helpful but the commentary below from the DP Review Canon S400 forums is really what counts. Make sure that the sliding switch for the take/review function is correctly located before you re-assemble as noted below. I didn't and had to dissamble it again. The other problem I had was screw #13 on page 4 of the PDF. It was hard to get it in. Barb managed to do it. I struggled unsuccessfully for over half an hour. All in all, it was worth it. Now I don't have to buy a new point and shoot. I think that if I were, I'd seriously consider the brand new<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0602/06021405panasonictz1.asp"> Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1</a> (my only concern is the high ISO, is it noisy?). </p>

These screws are of different lengths and it is important to lay them out in a logical manner so that later you can replace them correctly. Carefully separate the halves of the casing.

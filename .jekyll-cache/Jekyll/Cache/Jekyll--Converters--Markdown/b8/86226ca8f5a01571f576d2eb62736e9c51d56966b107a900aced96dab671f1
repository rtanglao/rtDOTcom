  <li>It‚Äôs a great idea and works in the city of Vancouver except when it‚Äôs snowing and or heavily raining i.e. it works for 365 days a year minus 100 hours or so :-) but we love our convenience and able bodied folks can‚Äôt cope with a wee bit of rain or coolness (which is weird to me since those same folks eat outside in -10 at ski resorts like Whistler)</li>

      <li>From <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/10/945136599/how-spanish-flu-pandemic-changed-home-heat-radiators">NPR</a>: ‚ÄúCHANG: Oh, so familiar. As it turns out, radiators that work too well  are partly a result of the 1918 flu pandemic. You see; there was once  something called the Fresh Air Movement. It called for people to be  outside more and for there to be plenty of ventilation indoors.‚Äù</li>

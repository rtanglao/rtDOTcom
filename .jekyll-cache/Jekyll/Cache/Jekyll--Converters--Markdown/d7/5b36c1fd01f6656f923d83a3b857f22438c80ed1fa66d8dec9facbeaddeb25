<p>Ah the current sad state of computer software, hardware and experience where only a few companies like Apple can make a compelling, complete experience. (i.e. beyond the  <a href="http://www.mobileindustryreview.com/2011/01/the-iphone-is-the-markets-fisher-price-smartphone-its-time-to-reach-beyond.html">Fisher Price iPhone experience</a>; I love Fisher Price Ewan, I also love computer power tools like Ubuntu and Emacs) . I am looking forward to trying out Android in depth but it feels like Linux before Ubuntu rather than a compelling experience that can compete with Apple‚Äôs.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs time for real total mobile experience innovation. One that isn‚Äôt tethered to a PC. One that helps me manage my life without drowning in a sea of overlapping and confusing apps or ‚Äúad driven where my data is sold to the highest bidder‚Äù web apps.</p>

<p>Perhaps I‚Äôll just give in to my geeky nature and run my own powerful but hard to use server for services for my mobile like I run this blog on my own server.</p>

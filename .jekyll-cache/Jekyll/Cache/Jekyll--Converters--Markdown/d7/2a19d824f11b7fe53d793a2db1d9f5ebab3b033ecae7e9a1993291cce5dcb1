InÂ­stead of deÂ­mandÂ­ing that othÂ­ers reÂ­flect your views, reÂ­flect on yourÂ­self. Try to reÂ­membÂ­er the last time someÂ­one sucÂ­cessfulÂ­ly chanÂ­ged your mind. Try, just for a moÂ­ment, to supÂ­pose that it's proÂ­babÂ­ly unÂ­naturÂ­al for an inÂ­dustÂ­ry to be so heaviÂ­ly dominated by white/asian middle-class males under 30 who keep tellÂ­ing each other to only hire their friends. HavÂ­ing supÂ­posed that, think about what a just fuÂ­ture should look like, and how to get there.</code></p>

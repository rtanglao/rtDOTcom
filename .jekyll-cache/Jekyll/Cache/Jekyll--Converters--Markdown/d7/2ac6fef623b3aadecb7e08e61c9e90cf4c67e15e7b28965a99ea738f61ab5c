    <p><a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/12/07/dijkstras-truths-about-computing-education-are-mostly-wrong/">Dijkstraâ€™s Truths about Computing Education Arenâ€™t</a>: The many kinds of programming &lt;â€“ â€œOf course, there are innate differences between people, but that fact  doesnâ€™t have to limit who can program. Computers are the most flexible  medium that humans have ever created. To argue that only a small  percentage of people can â€œgroove with programmingâ€ or that learning a  specific programming language â€œmentally mutilatesâ€ is to define  programming in a very narrow way. There are <em>lots</em> of activities that are programmingâ€ &lt;â€“ AMEN!</p>

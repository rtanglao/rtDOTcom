<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

React Native enables you build ‚ÄúNative‚Äù mobile apps using only JavaScript. Once the system is set up, it works like magic. Setup is still an issue for kids and many beginners. That‚Äôs where Expo.io is so useful. If you are a student or a beginner just go to Expo Snack and code your react project. Then scan the QR code on the snack page using Expo iOS app or Android App. Voila the app starts running on your phone. You can bookmark or create shortcuts. You can share the link with your friends to share the app.

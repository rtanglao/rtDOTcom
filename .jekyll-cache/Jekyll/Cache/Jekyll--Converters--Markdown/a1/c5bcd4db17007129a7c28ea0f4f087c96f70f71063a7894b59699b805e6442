I"[<p>Amen, Brothers Jay and Jeff! Slogan der Woche!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2005_01_17.html#008898">BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>In the old days, if you wanted to publish or broadcast, you had to have expensive equipment and expertise; you had to know the guy who owned the means of distribution (printing press or broadcast tower or cable); you had to have a fortune for marketing. Now, anyone can create content (and, better yet, conversation) and do it inexpensively with new equipment and tools; they can distribute it online and they can "market" it (that is, it can be found) thanks to search, links, and the metadata they create. All this levels the playing field. As Jay Rosen says: "A blog, you see, is a little First Amendment machine."

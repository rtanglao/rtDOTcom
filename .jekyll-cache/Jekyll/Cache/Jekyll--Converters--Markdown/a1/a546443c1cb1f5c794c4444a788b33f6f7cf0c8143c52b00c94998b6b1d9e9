<blockquote> He said that TELUS has been playing catchup with Rogers in some areas of wireless applications because of Rogers&#39; use of GSM and the greater number of applications that exist for that platform. He noted the earlier availability of RIM Blackberry as an example. <br /> <br />We can argue about whether or not CDMA may be a better network technology, but what is clear is that consumers are more concerned about what they can do with the technology - not the inner workings themselves. <br /> <br />Look at Betamax as a great example. </blockquote>

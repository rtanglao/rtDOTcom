  <li>The global south will lead this.</li>
  <li>This is where Canada could and should (sorry about the should word :-) ) lead. The future. Renewable, green energy which provides jobs and super large infrastructure projects instead of the same old same old oil and gas projects (I am OK with being honest and saying we need some oil and gas projects for a very limited time and here is our clear and actionable roadmap and plan to get off of oil and gas. Two ideas I can hold in my head simultaneously).</li>
  <li>And it goes with saying climate change is the number one issue for all humans! And itâ€™s not a zero sum game in fact itâ€™s win win. More jobs more better clean air, more more more!</li>

  <li>Law abiding people don’t exist when driving cars (as well as bicycles; bicycles aren’t 4000 pounds of daily danger, the consequences of law breaking are much lower on a bicycle especially an “acoustic” :-) one; I don’t condone breaking traffic laws when bicycling or driving.).</li>
  <li>I ride (<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/22831652">my rides on Strava</a>) 12km (6km each way Trout Lake to Gastown) Monday-Friday and I see in the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/667837446/seeker-4k-bike-dashcam-and-safety-lighting-system">Apeman R1 seeker rear view real time video camera</a> I got in 2023 or was it 2024 :-) at least a couple of cars or trucks with their daytime running lights off. These people are probably the ones who complain about bicyclists not following traffic laws LOL.</li>
  <li>For a good time :-) see <a href="https://www.drivesmartbc.ca/safety-equipment/viewpoint-daytime-running-lights">VIEWPOINT - Daytime Running Lights</a> which has this juicy <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Daytime running lights have been mandatory for vehicles in Canada since 1990. It appears many drivers and vehicle dealers are not aware of this requirement. Having driven thousands of kilometres over the last 40 years I know that DRL can help prevent accidents particularly on poor light and rainy conditions.</code>

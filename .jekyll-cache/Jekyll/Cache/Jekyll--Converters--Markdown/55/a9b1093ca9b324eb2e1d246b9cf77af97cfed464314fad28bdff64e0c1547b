When I first read this on the <a href="http://www.6smarketing.com/blog/the_top_20_twitterers_in_vancouver/">6S Marketing SEO Blog</a>, I thought oh well another list that only online people will care about. Then I found that it was published in the Vancouver Sun. Interesting crossover! Not sure how important these lists are but they are fun! What I would say (as always) that expressing yourself online for business, and fun (not in that order!) is now more important than ever. Luckily, this is now easier than ever!

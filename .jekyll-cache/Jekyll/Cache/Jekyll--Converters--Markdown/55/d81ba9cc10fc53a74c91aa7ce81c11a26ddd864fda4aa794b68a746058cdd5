Read the whole thing â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Most hackers live under the comfortable belief that it â€œcanâ€™t happen hereâ€, but it can and it does. I attended a hacker event this year â€“ HiP Berlin â€“ where I discovered that some of the organizers had cooperated to make it possible for multiple known rapists to participate, working together to find a way to circumvent the eventâ€™s code of conduct â€“ a document that they were tasked with enforcing. One of the victims was in attendance, believing the event to be safe. At every hacker event I have attended in recent memory, I have personally witnessed or heard stories of deeply problematic behavior and protection for its perpetrators from the leadership....Our community has problems, important problems, that every hacker should care about, and we need the bravery and humility to face them, not the cowardice to retaliate against those who speak up. Talk to, listen to, and believe your peers and their stories. Stand up for whatâ€™s right, and speak out when you see something that isnâ€™t. Demand that your leaders and moderators do the right thing. Make a platform where people can safely speak about what our community needs to do right by them, and have the courage to listen to them and confront yourself....You need to be someone who will do something about it.</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Chapter 3 of this PhD thesis from late 2019 is well worth reading:  <a href="http://ancad.ro/phd.pdf">Anca Dumitrache: Truth in Disagreement: Crowdsourcing Labeled Data for Natural Language Processing</a> &lt;â€”- actually read chapter 4 too if you have time and read chapter 4 if you have even more time :-)</li>
</ul>

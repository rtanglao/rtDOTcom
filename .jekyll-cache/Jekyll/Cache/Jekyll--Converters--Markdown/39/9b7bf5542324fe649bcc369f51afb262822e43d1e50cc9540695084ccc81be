I"\<p>If <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture</a> is as good as it sounds, Apple's going to sell a ton of machines to run it. My two takeways from Aperture: 
<ul><li>It shows the lack of imagination and vision from Adobe et al that they haven't thought of something like this. RAW workflow, image file management, etc. so obviously s*ck in all the software out there today! Can you say market opportunity in cloning Aperture? Again, Apple leads, the rest of the industry sleeps, awakes and clones. </li><li>Shows the failure of the Power PC consortium (Apple, Motorola and IBM) to deliver when you can't run all of Aperture's features on a laptop with a PowerPC.  Another validation of the move to Intel.</li></ul> As soon as I can afford a dual processor Mac, Intel or otherwise, (which should be sometime by the end of 2006 :-( and Aperture 2.0), I'm probably going to buy this.</p>

<blockquote><p>JS: The price says we're standing behind our claim that it's a pro tool. Aperture is an all-in-one post-production tool for pro photographers. It's easy to look at apps that cost from $0 to $50 and say, "They're all-in-one apps; why is Aperture so much more?"
</p>
<p>But Aperture has to be an all-in-one for what professionals do. Compare Aperture's price to the price of buying Capture One plus Photoshop, and Aperture is less.
</p>
<p>If anyone is feeling pinched by iPhoto, we want this to be a logical jump up. But it is a jump up.

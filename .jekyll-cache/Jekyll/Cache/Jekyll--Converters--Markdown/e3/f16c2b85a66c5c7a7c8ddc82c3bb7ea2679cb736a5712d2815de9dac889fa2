<blockquote>

"If you want to deny that climate change is happening, then really you need to be a part of the knowledge generation that does that. In other words if you are going to make that case- go and have it published in a scientific journal, have it peer-reviewed. Rather than just saying I have formed this view based on, what seems to me, as an amateur, to be a credible source of information."

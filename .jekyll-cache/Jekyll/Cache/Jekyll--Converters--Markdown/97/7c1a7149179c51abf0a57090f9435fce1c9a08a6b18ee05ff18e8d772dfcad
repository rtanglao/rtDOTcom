<ul>
  <li>As per: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/05/p1-omni-outliner-for-windows/">Looking for recommendations: OmniOutliner for Windows or as a cross platform webapp? Checkvist seems close!</a> I’ve been trying out Checkvist for the last week i.e. <a href="https://checkvist.com/checklists/695874">Week 3 of My Firefox 63 desktop SUMO forum report</a>.</li>
  <li>So far so good except for html export which doesn’t implement expand and collapse “disclosure triangles” unlike omnioutliner!
    <ul>
      <li>Hope lives on, maybe somebody can write or has written a markdown to disclosure triangle HTML script or some such :-)</li>
      <li>or maybe I’ll write the script (unlikely :-) !)</li>
      <li>or maybe somebody has done one for markdown?!?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

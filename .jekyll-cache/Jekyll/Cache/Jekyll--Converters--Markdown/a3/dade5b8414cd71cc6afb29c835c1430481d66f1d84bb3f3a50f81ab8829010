    <p>Strong opinions should be very loosely held if you are not an expert and beware of those who think they are experts on everything just because they â€œread itâ€ and or did their â€œresearchâ€</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We argue here that peopleâ€™s limited knowledge and their misleading intuitive epistemology combine to create 
an illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). Most people feel they understand the world with far greater detail, coherence,
and depth than they really do. The illusion for explanatory knowledgeâ€“knowledge that involves complex causal patternsâ€”is separate from, and
additive with, peopleâ€™s general overconfidence about their knowledge and skills. We therefore propose that knowledge of complex causal relations is
particularly susceptible to illusions of understanding.</p>

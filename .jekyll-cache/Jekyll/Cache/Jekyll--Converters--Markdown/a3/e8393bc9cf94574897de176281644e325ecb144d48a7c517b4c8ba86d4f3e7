<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>A heads-up about an upcoming server change. Since I'm not pursuing a podcasting business with Adam Curry, he's going to move his sites off my servers, on or before the end of this month. That includes ipodder.org and curry.com, but not audio.weblogs.com, which will remain on my server. After the transition, ipodder.org will be hosted on one of Adam's servers, and he will be responsible for its performance. I will continue to host The Dawn and Drew Show for the forseeable future. Sorry if this is confusing.</blockquote>

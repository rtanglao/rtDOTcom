  <li>Read  the whole thing from the Computing Education Research Blog:<a href="https://computinged.wordpress.com/2019/03/25/task-specific-programming-languages-past-guzdial-is-smarter-than-present-guzdial/">Task-specific programming languages: People arenâ€™t dumb. Programming is hard.</a>:  â€œPeople arenâ€™t dumb. Programming languages are hard.  If we can fix that, we should. Thatâ€™s what I see task-specific programming as being about.â€</li>
  <li>I think weâ€™ve tried this before but itâ€™s time to try again. And learn from Matlab, R, Logo, Hypercard, spreadsheets etc</li>
  <li>Anybody should be able to express what they want and create a crude software tool to do it and then hand it off to others for refinement and user experience improvement if need be.  I bet more than 50% of the time the crude software tool created by normal folks would be super useful at least as a working prototype.</li>

What if we are in that same thirty-year gap in the design of programming
languages? â€œ</li>

      <li>I am not 100% convinced but hey we have so many really  bad videos now including mine :-) so why not a world of bad but fun audio :-) after all <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/03/16/p1-voice-is-just-a-content-type-everybody-should-publish-what-they-want-video-audio-text-whatever-to-whoever-they-want/">There‚Äôs nothing special about voice or podcasts, everybody should be able to publish what they: voice, audio, text, video whatever whenever they want to whomever they want</a></li>

Write View for back links (i.e. not the full AppView and not the Relay) on a raspberry pi</a> &lt;â€“ <strong>QUOTE</strong>: ` a Hard Thing that BlueSkyâ€™s AppView implementation must do is serve over 31 million users (read load) with best-in-class feedgen. Our self-host dream doesnâ€™t involve that. â€¦ Our self-host dream does involve handling the same 31M user write load as Blueskyâ€™s, but I think this is where the itâ€™s expensive critique gets wires crossed: Blueskyâ€™s read load is whatâ€™s actually expensive. I have a billion links on a happy raspberry pi.`</p>

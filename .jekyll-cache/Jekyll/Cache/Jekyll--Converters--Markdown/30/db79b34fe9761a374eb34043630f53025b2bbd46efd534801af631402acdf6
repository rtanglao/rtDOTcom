<h2 id="quote">QUOTE</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’ve written UI tests with other frameworks in the past, you can see why we’re so excited about Maestro. It reduces the time to build a functioning UI test by &gt;10x, and more importantly makes updating them just as easy.
Why Maestro?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maestro is built on learnings from its predecessors (Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, and XCTest), but we ditched the complexity, kept the good stuff, and added some fundamental improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are some of the reasons why we believe Maestro is the future of mobile UI testing:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in tolerance to flakiness. UI elements will not always be where you expect them, screen tap will not always go through, etc. Maestro embraces the instability of mobile applications and devices, and counters it under the hood.</li>
    <li>Built-in tolerance to delays. No need to pepper your tests with sleep() calls. Maestro knows that it might take time to load the content (i.e. over the network) and automatically waits for it (but no longer than required).</li>
    <li>Blazingly fast iteration. Tests are interpreted, so no need to compile anything. Maestro is able to continuously monitor your test files and rerun them as they change.</li>
    <li>Declarative yet powerful syntax. Define your tests in a simple yaml file.</li>
    <li>Simple setup. Maestro is a single binary that works anywhere.</li>
    <li>Cross-platform. Maestro runs on iOS and Android and supports ReactNative, Flutter, WebViews, and pure Native applications.</li>
  </ul>

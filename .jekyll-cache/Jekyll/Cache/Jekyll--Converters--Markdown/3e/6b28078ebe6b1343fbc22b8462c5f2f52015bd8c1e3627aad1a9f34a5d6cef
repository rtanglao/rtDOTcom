Up until just a few years ago, teaching a computer to do the same thing required extensive machine learning expertise and access to powerful computing resources. Now, frameworks like TensorFlow are helping to simplify the process of building machine learning models, and making it more accessible to developers with no background in ML. ... In this post, weâ€™ll show you how to build a simple model to predict the tag of a Stack Overflow question. Weâ€™ll solve this text classification problem using Keras, a high-level API built in to TensorFlow.</code></p>

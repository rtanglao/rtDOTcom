<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>I&#8217;m happy to report that it&#8217;s possible with fairly minimal effort to get Markdown.pl to function as a service in OS X. This makes Markdown functionality available inside of Cocoa text fields, which means that everything from Safari to Mail to SubEthaEdit to Stickies can benefit.</blockquote>

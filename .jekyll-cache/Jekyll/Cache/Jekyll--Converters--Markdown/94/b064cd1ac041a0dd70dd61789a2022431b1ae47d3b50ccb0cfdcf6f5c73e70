  <li>Read the whole thing: <a href="https://grebedoc.dev/">Grebedoc — static site hosting for git forges</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short: a service that publishes the pages branch in your Git repository as a website on your domain; think GitHub Pages if it was open source and community operated.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>More specifically, it is a public deployment of git-pages and Caddy configured to work especially with Codeberg but also with other Git forges. It is operated by Catherine ‘whitequark’ and teammates, and currently deployed using Rage4 anycast infrastructure routing to VPSes in six regions (Europe, North America East, North America West, South America, East Asia, Australia), with site contents stored on Tigris and backed up to Wasabi.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This service is provided as a public utility, especially for those migrating from GitHub to community operated forges, and we plan to operate it indefinitely. It is monitored and has a status page.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The size of a website is currently limited to 768 MiB. We are aiming to eventually raise this to 10 GiB.</p>

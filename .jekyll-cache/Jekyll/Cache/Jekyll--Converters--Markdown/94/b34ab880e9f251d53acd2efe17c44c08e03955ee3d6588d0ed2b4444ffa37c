<ul>
  <li>I probably should have read <a href="http://moderndive.com">Modern Dive - An Introduction to Statistical and Data Sciences via R</a> before I started with this â€œR, ggplot2 and tidyverseâ€ malarkey :-) <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/08/04/p1-free-learning-modern-r-with-modern-data-tidying-packages-and-ggplot/">And I might actually finish this book unlike what I blogged previously</a>! Itâ€™s short, sweet and very simply written (which is not easy!).</li>
  <li>Which would have required time travel since it didnâ€™t get published until Feb 2017 and then August 2, 2017 for the latest current version, 0.2.</li>
</ul>

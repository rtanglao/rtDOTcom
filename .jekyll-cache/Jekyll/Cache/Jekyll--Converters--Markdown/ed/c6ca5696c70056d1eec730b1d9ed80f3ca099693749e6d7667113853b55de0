I"X<p>As a followup to <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2012/04/08/wanted-two-n8-cameraphone-apps-settings-locked-default-hyperfocal-street">WANTED: Two N8 Cameraphone apps with settings locked: default + hyperfocal street photography</a>, here's my N8 cameraphone picture taking workflow (I have been doing this since 2008 and as a result have far <a href="http://flickr.com/roland/tags/cameraphone">over 50000 cameraphone pictures</a> :-) !) while bicycling to work:</p>
<ol><li>N8 is on a lanyard around my neck</li><li>I see something interesting</li><li>I take the picture using the N8 built-in cameraphone app custom setting (my custom mode is the default settings with flash turned off)</li><li>I drop the phone gently and it bounces harmlessly on my chest</li><li>I continue bicycling</li><li>Goto step 2</li></ol>
<p>I would like an app with the touchscreen off because sometimes I accidentally trigger the photo editor.</p>
<p>I would like an app that locks out other apps because sometimes I accidentally quit out of the camera app. During my ride I don't use any other apps.</p>

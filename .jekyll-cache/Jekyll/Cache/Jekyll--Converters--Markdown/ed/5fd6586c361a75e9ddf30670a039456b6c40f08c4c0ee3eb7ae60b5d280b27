    <p>“Machine learning engineering is becoming a real ecosystem</p>

    <p>Looking at software engineering as a parallel, we typically see ecosystems “mature” in pretty standard patterns.</p>

    <p>A new programming language will emerge with some exciting features, and  people will use it for specialized use-cases, research projects, and  toys. At this stage, anyone who uses it has to build all their basic  utilities from scratch.</p>

    <p>Down the line, people within the community develop libraries and projects  that abstract common utilities away, until the tooling is capable and  stable enough to be used in production.” &lt;— Read the whole thing:  “<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-isnt-hard-anymore-26db0d4749d7">Deep learning isn’t hard anymore</a>”</p>

Got my ustream.tv webcast to work with my Canon DV camera over Firewire.  Here is my 'cast: <a href="http://ustream.tv/watch/channel/C8XGwQOFOzMIodKzFBgidA">Roland's Mundane TV</a>. <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2007/04/16/userve-tv-doesnt-stream-video-with-ppc-macs-and-isight">It wouldn't work with my iSight with my Power PC Powerbook G4</a>. Strange but true :-) ! Guess the ustream.tv crew only tested with intel Macs!

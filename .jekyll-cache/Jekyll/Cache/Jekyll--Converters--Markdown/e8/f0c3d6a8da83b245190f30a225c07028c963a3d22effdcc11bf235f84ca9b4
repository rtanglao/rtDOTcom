<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In the last month or so I've received a number of links to Life With Alacrity as a venture capital blog, and to myself as a venture capitalist. </p> <p>However, I don't consider myself a venture capitalist. Instead, I am what is known as an &quot;angel investor&quot;. </p> <p>This week has also seen a new topic enter the blog zeitgeist: the topic of reforming or reinventing venture capital. This topic was initially raised by Dave Winer, followed by Robert Scoble, Doc Searls, Michael Arrington, Thatedeguy and many more. </p> <p>All types of venture investment -- seed, angel, venture, and institutional alike -- carry with it great risks and great rewards. But before we can reinvent venture capital and related venture funding methods like angel capital, we need to understand how it works.</p> </blockquote>

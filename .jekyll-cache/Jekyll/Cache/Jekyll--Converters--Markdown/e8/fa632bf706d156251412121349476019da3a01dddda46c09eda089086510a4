<br /><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">Amen! - &quot;About 20 weeks ago, on September 28, 2004, I heard the term &quot;podcast&quot; for the very first time when Doc Searls explained it on his &quot;IT Garage&quot; blog. He said then that the word podcast returned 24 results on Google. After reading the long, long NY Times piece yesterday on podcasting, I wondered how many results the word would return. Yesterday, it was 687,000, today it is 1,700,000. A rather wide range, but the point is, it's a big number. (Update: Panaytonis Vryonis at g-metrics.com (see comments) showed me a really cool way to track these kind of things.)&quot;</span>

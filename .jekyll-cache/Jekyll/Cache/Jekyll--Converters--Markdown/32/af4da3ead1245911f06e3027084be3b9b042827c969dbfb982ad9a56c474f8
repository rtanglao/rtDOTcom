Thereâ€™s a big trend in the software world of adopting more functional programming techniques (see e.g. recent Java releases). Weâ€™re also seeing growing usage of type systems again (see recent PHP releases, Typescript, Flow by FB). Haskell sits at the end of this trendline and I think itâ€™s time for Haskell to gain more widespread adoption....For that we designed IHP for non-Haskellers to use. All other Haskell frameworks are usually designed for people who are experts in Haskell. IHP is for the developers who like FP-techniques and also want type-safety, but donâ€™t know about Haskell yet.</code></p>

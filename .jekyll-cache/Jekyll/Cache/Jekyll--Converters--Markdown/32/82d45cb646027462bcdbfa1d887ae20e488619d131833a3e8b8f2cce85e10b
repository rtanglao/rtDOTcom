  <p>Conclusion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LLMs are clearly useful today, and I believe they will be even better tomorrow. But I do not know how long this trend will hold.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Put differently: I think there is a very real probability that in five years we look back at the LLM hype of 2023-2025, we see it like we now see the Internet bubble of 1998-2000 (that is: a very new technology that will eventually have an impact, but that was overhyped in the short term). But I also think there is also a very real probability that, in the future, we will look back at the mid 2020s as the beginning of a new era, and when we list the most important inventions of humanity we include â€œAIâ€ in the same sentence as the wheel or the printing press.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I hope that Iâ€™ve successfully argued in this article is that you should be willing to entertain that either of these two futures is possible. Neither is guaranteed, but neither is unquestionably impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>In some small number of years weâ€™ll have an answer to this question. And it will look obvious, in retrospect, what the answer was. Weâ€™ll say â€œOf course scaling continued for another five years, Mooreâ€™s law held, why wouldnâ€™t we expect the AI equivalent to hold??â€ or weâ€™ll say â€œNo exponential continues forever, isnâ€™t it obvious that LLMs plateaued??â€ And the half of the people who were unreasonably confident but ended up right will have the ability to say â€œI told you soâ€. I just hope that we remember that predicting the future is hard, and we honestly canâ€™t know exactly how this is going to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So over the next few years, Iâ€™d encourage you to keep an open mind and be willing to see the world as it is, and not as you want it to be. Weâ€™re going to learn a lot, things are going to change a lot, and so we need to be willing to accept what comes to pass, and not reject something just because itâ€™s not what we expected.</p>

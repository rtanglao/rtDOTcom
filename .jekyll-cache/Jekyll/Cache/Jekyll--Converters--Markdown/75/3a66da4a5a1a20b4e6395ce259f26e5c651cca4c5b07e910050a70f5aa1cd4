      <p>Let‚Äôs take a moment here. Whether or not Vince Gilligan meant to evoke the pandemic with this show, this is a show carrying a lot of psychic COVID baggage. The show begins with misused PPE, animal transmission/lab leak (pick your theory!), and the inversion of early pandemic measures.
Rather than social distancing, these characters immediately begin kissing on the mouth. To me- and I‚Äôd guess, many other COVID cautious individuals, the invaded personal space and licked donuts evoke people‚Äôs continued insistence that they have the right not to isolate and mask while infected with COVID.
What‚Äôs mine is yours, what‚Äôs yours is mine.
Rather than swab to prevent the spread of disease, they swab to further it. And while to many this may feel like a far-fetched, sci-fi premise, for those of us living with Long COVID, it does in fact feel that most people today are actively promoting the spread of COVID rather than engaging with our ongoing efforts to halt and reduce the virus‚Äô spread.
For example, we‚Äôve known for years that cleaning the indoor air by introducing higher ventilation standards and HEPA filtration standards would drastically reduce airborne illness. There‚Äôs a new technology called Far UVC that inactivates viral pathogens in the air. Combining these two could be a game changer- drastically reducing how much we all get sick. Yet no matter how much we bring up this idea- and no matter how often and how seriously their children get sick- people seem to prefer getting sick than breaking from The Borg.
And The Borg, to be clear, is approximately where the show goes next.</p>

  <li>From the rolandtanglao.com archives: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020402073722/http://www.rolandtanglao.com/">April 1, 2002 from the wayback machine aka Internet Archive: O’Reilly Network: Jon Udell: Instant Outlining, Instant Gratification (Apr. 01, 2002)</a> &lt;– it only took 19 years but maybe <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/11.html#a131743">Instant Outlining is coming back</a>?!?!? It was a good idea in the 2000s and it’s a good idea in 2021! Thanks, Dave, UserLand folks and everybody else involved for the original idea!</li>

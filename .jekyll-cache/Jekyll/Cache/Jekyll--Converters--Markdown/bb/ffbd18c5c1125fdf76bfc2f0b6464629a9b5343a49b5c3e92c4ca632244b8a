I"<p>For those who don&#39;t follow the Nokia soap opera, the <a href="http://www.nseries.com/index.html?l=products,n96#l=products,n96">N96</a> flagship (with 5 megapixel camera and an incredible 16 GB flash card built in with a micro SD slot so you can expand to 24GB and soon 32GB but with a low res 320x240 screen) introduced today at the Mobile World Congress looks almost exactly like the N81 (major difference: N96 is a dual slider)</p>
<p>Not a big fan of the N81 (it&#39;s a great Walkman for those who don&#39;t want an iPod and have lots of money but the 2 megapixel camera is b*gus) but it does look a lot better than the N95. I do wish that Nokia had come up with something more radically beautiful when designing its next flagship. Shame the N96 has the same lock switch as the N81. Fingers crossed that the N96 lock switch is less finicky than my N81 (my N81 lockswitch sticks). But oh the possibilities with 24GB of storage! Yum! Go Nokia go! Now just fix S60 and make the screen bigger and you&#39;ll finally have one device that does everything!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://web.mac.com/jamesburland/Nokia_Creative/Blog/Entries/2008/2/11_World_Mobile_Congress_2008%3A_N96._Press_Photos.html"><cite>World Mobile Congress 2008: N96. Press Photos</cite></a>:  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a previous post I expressed by appreciation for the Nokia N81. The simplicity and balance of the design certainly make for a classic look. Hence, I was really pleased to see that the industrial design of The Dark Knight (N96) borrows so heavily from the N81.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;<br />   There is a real attention to detail here. Is it perfect? No. Is it close to perfect? Yes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

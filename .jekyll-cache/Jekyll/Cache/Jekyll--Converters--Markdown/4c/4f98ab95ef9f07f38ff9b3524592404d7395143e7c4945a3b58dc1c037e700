I didn’t need S🇺bstack’s Tw🇮tter-esque Notes feature or its recommendation network to grow; I used social networks — mostly Bluesky — to successfully promote my work. That personal engagement created, I believe, deeper relationships with my readers than passive subscriptions via an algorithm. Most importantly, I’ve remained committed to producing work that I’m proud of, and publishing it via a platform that doesn’t force me to compromise my values.</code> &lt;– <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryanhatesthis.bsky.social/post/3ldjeowoaas2b">Read Ryanb Broderick’s bluesky thread</a></p>

I"3<p>I can’t listen to my friend Kevin’s <a href="https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-12/">second</a> and <a href="https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-19/">third</a> pre 1989 alternative 80s shows because the web developer failed or something or React fails? <a href="https://cfmu.ca/episode/alternative-pre-89-episode-for-2025-11-05/">The first episode</a> works fine. I tried debugging it with Firefox web tools and couldn’t figure it out i.e. I’m a terrible hobbyist web developer part 8888 :-).</p>

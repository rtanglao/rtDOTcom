  <li>I followed the <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2016/10/flickr-cc0/">cogdog’s lead</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/cogdog/status/786605437831356416">hilarious twitter thread with flickr support</a>; why is software so hard :-) ?!? Kudos to flickr support!) and made my 175000 flickr photos CC0 aka public domain. Enjoy! (most of them were CC by attribution formerly; but really <a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2015/06/brief-stint-attribution-cop/">will life end if I don’t get attribution</a> :-) ? are my photos my livelihood my precious? Answer: no!).</li>
  <li>Preach it cogdog (<a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2016/10/flickr-cc0/">read the whole thing</a>):</li>

  <p>“My strategy is do more than just comply. I try to
attribute everything, even if I do not have to. I use
many images from Pixabay which are all licensed CC0. And
I give credit.</p>

  <p>When I use my own images, I don’t have to get
permission,right? Well I still attribute my own media.
Boy am I silly.”</p>

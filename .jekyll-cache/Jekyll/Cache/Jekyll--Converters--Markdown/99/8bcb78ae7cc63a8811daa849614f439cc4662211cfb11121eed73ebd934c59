<ul>
  <li>Forgot to blog about meeting up (at Revolver naturally :-) !)  with Simon Goring (<a href="https://downwithtime.wordpress.com/">research blog</a>, <a href="http://www.goring.org/">personal blog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sjGoring">twitter</a>) a few weeks back.</li>
  <li>He’s a <a href="http://www.geography.wisc.edu/faculty/williams/lab/people.html">University of Wisconsin</a> scientist who somehow lives in Vancouver.</li>
  <li>He’s a really nice, down to earth scientist who knows about open data (including R language stuff!), open science, paleogeoscience and the neotoma paleocology database aka <a href="http://neotomadb.org/">neotomadb.org</a> and many other things that I know nothing about.</li>
  <li>We talked about my <a href="https://flickr.com/roland/tags/infoviz">Tshirt information visualizations</a> and he suggested that I check the average colour algorithm to see if I am getting the colours I should be getting. And to look into assertions for R.</li>
  <li>Unfortunately no picture silly me I forgot!</li>

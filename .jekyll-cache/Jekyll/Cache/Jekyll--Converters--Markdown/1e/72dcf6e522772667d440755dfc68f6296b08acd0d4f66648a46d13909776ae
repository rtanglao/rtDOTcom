  <li>In the previous post, I re-discovered :-) that pipe characters aka the â€œor symbol â€œ aka <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> must be escaped with a backslash to prevent being interpreted as a Markdown table. <a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-308">Example 308 of the github flavoured markdown spec</a> seems to document which characters must be escaped (e.g. in addition to the pipe character, exclamation mark, quotation marks, etc.):
    <ul>
      <li>!"#$\%\&amp;'()*+\,-.\/:\;&lt;=&gt;\?\@[\]\^_`{|}~</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>An AMA is more or less exactly what it sounds like â€” an opportunity to ask someone anything thatâ€™s on your mind on a given topic. In Digital Ladders terms, itâ€™s an opportunity for you to bring your specific questions, concerns, wonders, dilemmas, hopes, etc., to a digital expert.</p>

    <p>Each presenter will focus on a topic and will give a 5-10 minute overview including some basic information. After that, itâ€™s up to those attending to ask questions to guide and drive the conversation. By engaging with individual questions, the presenter can really respond directly to whatâ€™s uniquely relevant to participants, in an informal and relaxed environment.</p>

    <p>Whether youâ€™re facing a specific hurdle in the planning of a project, canâ€™t get the hang of a certain elusive piece of software, or find yourself quickly needing new tools as you tackle a project solo or with a small team, youâ€™ll get the answer you need to keep moving forward.</p>

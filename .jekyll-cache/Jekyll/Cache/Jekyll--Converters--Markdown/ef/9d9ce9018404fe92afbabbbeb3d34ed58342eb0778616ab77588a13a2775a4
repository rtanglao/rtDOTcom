I've recreated the core of it in github.com/gvwilson/lanimret, but if anyone knows where the original inspiration lives these days, I'd be grateful for a pointer. (Motivation is to record/play back live coding sessions as searchable text rather than video.) thx</code> &lt;â€“ <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@danielskatz/113567066272551465">followup from Daniel Katz</a>: <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">On a mac, you can just use command-shift 5 to record part of a screen, with audio from various sources</code></p>

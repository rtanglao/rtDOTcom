<a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a> recommends this (and I can borrow his expensive microphones initially).  It sounds good, compact and good fidelity.  If anybody has used this for Podcast recording on a Mac, let me know what you think.

<blockquote>
MobilePre USB is the preamp with a built-in audio interface that&#8217;s designed for laptop recording such as field recording and sampling expeditions. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the only completely bus-powered preamps available. (Of course, you can use it on the desktop as well.) A total of three kinds of audio inputs and outputs provide maximum flexibility for any application&#8212;including two on-board microphone/instrument preamps and high-impedance instrument inputs ideal for connecting guitars and basses. And unlike many competitors, zero-latency direct monitoring provides you with a streamlined professional recording experience.

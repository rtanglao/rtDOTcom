It can also do what‚Äôs called ‚Äúbackfeeding‚Äù, which we‚Äôll look at in a minute....brid.gy has really good and comprehensive docs which I recommend. My flow for publishing something now goes like this: 1. Post it on my website 2. Wait for it to go online via GitHub Pages 3. Tell brid.gy about the post, and it‚Äôll publish it to Twitter and Mastodon for me.... 4. Update the post with the Twitter and Mastodon links.</code></p>

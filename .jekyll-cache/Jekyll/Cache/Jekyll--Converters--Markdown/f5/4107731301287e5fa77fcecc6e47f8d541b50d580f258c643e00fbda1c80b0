Â¦ by Bryson Meiling Â¦ Oct, 2024 Â¦ Python in Plain English</a> &lt;â€“ how to check data in a data structure has the correct types without having to write parsing code. â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Try this, define a pydantic model, then pass the dict into is. If it passes, then you continue. It if fails, then you assume its a bad request. (code attached as a note but superbriefly: class ClassTypeYouAreChecking(BaseModel) field1 = int field2 = UUID etc)...Its much more clear about what data you are expecting, what is optional, and also pydantic library will check the types of these parameters automatically!</code></p>

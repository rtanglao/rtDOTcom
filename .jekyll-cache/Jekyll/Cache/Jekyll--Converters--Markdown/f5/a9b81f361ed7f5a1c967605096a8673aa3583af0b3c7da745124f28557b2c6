<blockquote>
  <p>To be clear, I don‚Äôt believe that this gradual ensh·úÅttification is part of some grand, Machiavellian long game by the tech companies, but rather the product of multiple consecutive decisions made in response to short-term financial needs. Even if it was, the result would be the same ‚Äî people wouldn‚Äôt notice how bad things have gotten until it‚Äôs too late, or they might just assume that tech has always sucked, or they‚Äôre just personally incapable of using the tools that are increasingly fundamental to living in a modern world.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are the victim of a con ‚Äî one so pernicious that you‚Äôve likely tuned it out despite the fact it‚Äôs part of almost every part of your life. It hurts everybody you know in different ways, and it hurts people more based on their socioeconomic status. It pokes and prods and twists millions of little parts of your life, and it‚Äôs everywhere, so you have to ignore it, because complaining about it feels futile, like complaining about the weather.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre battered by the Rot Economy, and a tech industry that has become so obsessed with growth that you, the paying customer, are a nuisance to be mitigated far more than a participant in an exchange of value. A death cult has taken over the markets, using software as a mechanism to extract value at scale in the pursuit of growth at the cost of user happiness.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>These people want everything from you ‚Äî to control every moment you spend working with them so that you may provide them with more ways to make money, even if doing so doesn‚Äôt involve you getting anything else in return.</p>

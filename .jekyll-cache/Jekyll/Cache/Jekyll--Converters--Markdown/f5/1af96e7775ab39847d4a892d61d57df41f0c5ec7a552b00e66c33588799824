Is this crazy?
Is this manageable?
Yes. Donâ€™t normally do everything at the same time!
Centralized tools may be better for synchronous - no seamless way to bring in external chatters

Itâ€™s more about want the students are doing not whatâ€™s going on in the front.
If you are worried about what your students are SMSing, etc, your class probably sucks!</p>

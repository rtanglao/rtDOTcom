  <li>I switched repeatedly! First because I wanted to try Windows 10 on a Microsoft laptop.</li>
  <li>And then back to the Mac because the Surface Book 2 had WiFi problems</li>
  <li>And then to the new refurbished Surface Book 2</li>
  <li>And then back to the Mac because of thread exception issues on the Surface Book 2</li>
  <li>And then back to the Surface Book 2 after re-installing Windows 10</li>

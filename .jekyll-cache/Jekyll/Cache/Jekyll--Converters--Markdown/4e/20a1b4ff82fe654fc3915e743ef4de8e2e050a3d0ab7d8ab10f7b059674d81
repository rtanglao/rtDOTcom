  <li>Do your own thing, do your own look and style, escape the bland hegemony :-)</li>
  <li>JUICY QUOTE (of course read the whole thing: <a href="https://www.alexmurrell.co.uk/articles/the-age-of-average">Alex Murrell: The age of average</a>):
```
But itâ€™s not all bad news.</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the age of average is the age of opportunity.</p>

<p>When every supermarket aisle looks like a sea of sameness, when every category abides by the same conventions, when every industry has converged on its own singular style, bold brands and courageous companies have the chance to chart a different course. To be different, distinctive and disruptive.</p>

<p>So, this is your call to arms. Whether youâ€™re in film or fashion, media or marketing, architecture, automotive or advertising, it doesnâ€™t matter. Our visual culture is flatlining and the only cure is creativity.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s time to cast aside conformity. Itâ€™s time to exorcise the expected. Itâ€™s time to decline the indistinguishable.</p>

<p>For years the world has been moving in the same stylistic direction. And itâ€™s time we reintroduced some originality.</p>

<p>Or as the ad agency BBH says.</p>

<p>When the world zigs. Zag.

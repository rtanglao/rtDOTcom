</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>I have maybe 20 websites (mostly static but not all)</li>
    <li>I want to spend basically 0 time maintaining them, maybe 5 minutes every 2 months at most</li>
    <li>I need to be able to ignore a project for 3 years and then come back and be able to develop it easily</li>
  </ul>

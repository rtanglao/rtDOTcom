<ul>
  <li>Why? Why not? Easer than Lisp intro to functional programming. I also want to write my own ebook with a similar learning style.</li>
  <li>I’d like to build my Tshirts from instagram metadata using software that’s easier to follow and has tests and haskell seems like an excellent choice.</li>
  <li>Get <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">the Haskell book</a>, you won’t regret it!</li>
  <li>I’d also like to learn more R, Julia and any language for Instagram machine learning (probably means more python!).</li>
</ul>

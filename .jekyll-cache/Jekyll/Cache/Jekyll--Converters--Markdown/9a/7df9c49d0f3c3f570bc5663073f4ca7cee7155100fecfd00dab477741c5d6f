I"å<p>Steve continues to nail it! More please! And more frequently please!</p>

<p> No matter what you call it, on the web, <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/10/07/the_link_is_everything">the link is everything</a>. Amen to that Steve and see you at <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a> (yes I am registered, and yes we will talk about <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/attentionxml">attention.xml</a> I hope!). Finally, I will never give up on humans as being the most effective filters no matter how great search feeds become. </p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Which leads us to podcasting. I&rsquo;ve been constrained by NDA and negotiations from discussing podcasting too much in the months since I shelved the Gillmor Gang. But the notion that podcasting is an inefficient use of time, vulnerable to its inability to be skimmed, and no threat to the broadcast incumbents&#8211;feh. Just as the Syndisphere is upending print and online publishing, so is it taking on the rest of the media. No, it&rsquo;s not destroying MSM. It is the new MSM. The users are in control, have been for months. The incumbents are burning up the emailosphere trying to corral this beast.</p>

<p>Finally, a question: in the Syndisphere, is the link the fundamental coin of the realm. If not, what is? </p> </blockquote>

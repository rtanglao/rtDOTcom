<blockquote>
  <p>Software should be a malleable medium, where anyone can edit their tools to better fit their personal needs. The laws of physics aren’t relevant here; all we need is to find ways to architect systems in such a way that they can be tweaked at runtime, and give everyone the tools to do so.</p>

  <p>Beyond the pragmatic efficiency benefits of building a browser extension, I would argue that it’s simply more fun to engage with the digital world in a read-write way, to see a problem and actually consider it fixable by tweaking from the outside.</p>

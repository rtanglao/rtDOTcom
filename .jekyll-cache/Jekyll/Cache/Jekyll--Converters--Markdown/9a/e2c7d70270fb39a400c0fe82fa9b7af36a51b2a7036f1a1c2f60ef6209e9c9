I"¥<p>I know I've drunk too much Nokia and Apple Kool-Aid but I thought Nokia was still the market leader in the mobile space and not Microsoft so I kind of thought ComVu would support Nokia Series 60 phones like my 7610 but I was wrong! Oh well, and I also grow weary of companies that claim to serve bloggers and videobloggers but don't actually have a blog themselves. It's not as if it's 1999 and blogging is a novelty.  Next!</p>

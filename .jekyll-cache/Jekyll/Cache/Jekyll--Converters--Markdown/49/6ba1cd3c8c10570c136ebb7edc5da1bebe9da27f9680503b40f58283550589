I"!<p><strong>Highly recommended</strong>. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rapsberryshake/">Carmela Sison</a> as Chef Mela is fabulous -&gt; Lasa ng Imperyo/<a href="https://talonbooks.com/books/a-taste-of-empire">A Taste of Empire</a>, an adaptation of a play by <a href="https://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Sy%2C%20Jovanni">Jovanni Sy,</a> is playing in North Vancouver at the <a href="https://www.phtheatre.org/stec_event/lasa-ng-imperyo/">Presentation House Theatre</a> until October 19, 2025. It’s a history lesson from Magellan to the Spanish Empire’s influence on Filipino cuisine since the 1500s to the Spanish American war’s killing of over 10, 000 Filipinos by American soldiers (some historians say many more like over 100, 000), to the migrant workers of Mexico in Abbotsford who in an ironic twist work hard with very low wages to supply tomatoes to Filipinos (ironic because Spanish Empire Philippines was administered from Acapulco, Mexico for over 200 years, see Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_galleon">Manila galleon</a>) to Trump and a <a href="https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/relyenong-bangus/">relyenong bangus</a> cooking lesson. It’s funny sad, and gut wrenching. Only $30! The first time I’ve seen a play in Tagalog with English subtitles. <strong>100% relevant to everybody not just Filipinos.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Superstar of the culinary world, Master Chef Maximo Cortés is offering an exclusive demonstration, sharing the secrets of his trademarked Imperial Cuisine cooking techniques with you, his lucky, elite guests! Or at least, he would have, if he had shown up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Luckily, the witty and intrepid Sous-Chef Mela is here to save the day! Her task? To cook rellenong bangus, or stuffed milkfish, a dish whose intricate preparation process takes its roots from the country’s culinary traditions and colonial past. In a surprising fusion of theatre and gastronomy, this live cooking demonstration pairs the harsh truths of a global food system with shocking humour. Performed in Tagalog with English surtitles, this show guides audiences across the layered history of Philippine cultural heritage through a live cooking demonstration.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This adaptation of Jovanni Sy’s <em>A Taste of Empire</em> reimagines this acclaimed play through a fresh female perspective. As the dish is brought to life, so too are the stories embedded within its ingredients.</p>

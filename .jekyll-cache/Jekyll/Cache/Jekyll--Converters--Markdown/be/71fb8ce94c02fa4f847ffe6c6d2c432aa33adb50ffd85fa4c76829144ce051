Often, though, people are repeating what Yale professor Timothy Snyder called â€œInternet Triggers,â€ which is something a person reads on the Internet, feels triggered by, and repeats. Iâ€™ve called them â€œrage-inducing simplifications,â€ because they tend to take a complex situation, reduce it to something that might contain some truth, but isnâ€™t true, and phrase it in a way that is likely to induce rage in the listener.</code></p>

I"C<p>After the 2.01 firmware upgrade, <a href="http://www.airme.com/">AirMe</a> never locks on with the GPS and finds my location even if I am outside in locations where it used to work with the old firmware. Yay for bugs (Yes my GPS is enabled). Do I have to do some sort of funky GPS reset dance to make it work again?</p>

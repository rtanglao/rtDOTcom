I"ò<p>Excellent How To. But it doesn't address my problem which is how to add music or other non live material to podcasts without using GarageBand.  When I get this working to my satisfaction (with or without GarageBand), I will publish my own recipe!</p>

<blockquote><p>Call me a lemming, but once I understood what podcasting was, I jumped aboard as quickly as possible. Podcasting could be seen as just another way to push audio to people who want to listen to it, but it's really a unique combination of subscription and publication.</p>

<p>My stumbling block? Turning interviews into podcasts using entirely digital production methods that would allow me to make phone calls and record directly to MP3 for simplicity. I worked it out, but not until I went through a lot of trial and error that I'll save you from.</p></blockquote>

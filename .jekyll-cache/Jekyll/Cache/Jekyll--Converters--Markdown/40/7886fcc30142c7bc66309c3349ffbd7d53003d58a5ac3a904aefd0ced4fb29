Even worse, it tends to erase the distinction, which leads to our 20% engineering time to be eaten up by work that is properly part of delivering business value, not sustaining work. When we allow the paydown of proper "debt" or rearchitecting for new requirements to happen in place of sustaining engineering work, we're both hiding the actual cost and making an inadvertent trade.</code> See also:<a href="https://technology.riotgames.com/news/taxonomy-tech-debt">A Taxonomy of Tech Debt from Riot Games</a></p>

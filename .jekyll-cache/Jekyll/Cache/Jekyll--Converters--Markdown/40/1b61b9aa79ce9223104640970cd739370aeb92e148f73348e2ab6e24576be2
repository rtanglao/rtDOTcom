I"'	<p> My apologies to <a href="http://abouttime.wordpress.com">Oren</a> and the <a href="http://www.contec.ca/">Contec</a> crew; they gave me an early <a href="http://www.buzmob.com/">BUZmob</a>  heads up and for no good reason I didn&#39;t get around to trying it. Tried it tonight and it rocks on my N93 (both WAP and normal WebKit browser). Fast, sleek and useful river of news RSS aggregator. Now <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/the-travesty-of-canadian-mobile-data-rates">if only we had affordable mobile internet in Canada</a>, sigh !  </p>
<p> Question for Oren et al: will it work  on any WiFi device? It works great on my Nokia N800. Will it work on other mobile devices like a Sony Playstation PSP or Nintento DS? My guess is yes!  </p>
<p> And a feature request: please have an automatic &#39;mark as read&#39; (don&#39;t need checkboxes but why show me something that I&#39;ve already read?).  </p>
<p> If you have a mobile device with WiFi or some sort of connectivity built in,  you&#39;ll have fun with BUZmob. It&#39;s a great way to browse the web (since anything important on the web is linked to from an RSS feed!) Check it out! Go Contec go! </p>

<blockquote> Wow, it&rsquo;s been a busy few months here at Contec Innovations.   Today we announced the immediate availability of our mobile feed publishing service, BUZmob. <br /> <br />BUZmob is a web-based service which allows content publishers - bloggers, media sites, social networks, business websites - to instantly make their RSS/Atom based content available to all of their mobile readers.  Mobile users need not download anything to their phones, and don&rsquo;t even have to subscribe to a web-based service in order to access mobile content.  The service combines text messaging, on-the-fly content adaptation, personalization, automatic bookmark generation and universal access to go beyond technophiles, and to enable even first time mobile-Internet users to easily interact with the content they regularly consume on the web. </blockquote>

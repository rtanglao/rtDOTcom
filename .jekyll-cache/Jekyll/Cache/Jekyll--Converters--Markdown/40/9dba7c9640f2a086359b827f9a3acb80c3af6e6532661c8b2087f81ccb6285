The kid and I promptly unpacked and danced around to the mediocre (Maroon 5 is not my cup of tea) music built in. Unlike <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2007/10/22/review-nokia-n81-8-gb-too-much-money-for-too-little-hardware.html">Stefan</a> and like <a href="http://saunderslog.com/2007/11/21/hands-on-with-the-nokia-n81/">Alec</a>, I like the build quality; the slide has a very sensual thunk for example and everything feels solid (perhaps Stefan had a creaky prototype?!?!)! The totally unnecessary multimedia key is nowhere to be found thank g*d And everything just works including the web browser which works just as fast as my N95-1. No GPS and only a 2 Megapixel camera so it's not for me but if you are looking for a iPod and don't want Apple (and have lots of money, approximately $CAN 600 according to Alec, unfortunately not available at <a href="http://search.dell.com/results.aspx?s=gen&amp;c=ca&amp;l=en&amp;cs=&amp;k=nokia+phones&amp;cat=all">Dell.ca</a> yet so you have to go through <a href="http://www.nokiausa.com/A4409002">Nokia USA</a> since <a href="http://www.nokia.ca/A4488003">Nokia.ca is still selling only very old phones</a>) this may be the way to go. More later when I load some good :-) music into this thing. This will probably replace the N800 as my iPod when cycling to work since the speakers are nice and loud!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

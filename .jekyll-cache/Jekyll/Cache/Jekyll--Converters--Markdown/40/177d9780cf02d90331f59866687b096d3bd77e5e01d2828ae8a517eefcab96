First, it allows them to blame subordinates for not speaking out (again, ignoring the experience some of those subordinates may have had of bosses who say â€œI want to hear what you thinkâ€ but really donâ€™t). Second, it satisfies tech brosâ€™ need to talk about something other than sexual harassment, racial discrimination, and pay inequityâ€”in other words, their need to talk about things that sound important but wonâ€™t make them uncomfortable or undermine the system that they hope will make them rich.</code></p>

  <li>I’ve never been great at navigation so I had a lot of anxiety because Radweg Reisen didn’t provide GPX files (they had Komoot trails on their website that didn’t match up with our bicycle tour), just a paper map! I would have  paid an extra 100 Euro for GPX files that one could load into Komoot, Strava or any popular bicycle wayfinding apps. I would still have got lost with the GPX files but much less so and it would have given us a route to go back to when inevitably we took the wrong turn.

      <li>Our neighbours Alex and Sharon had a good way to do this: have the route set by somebody who knows the trails and then have somebody who doesn’t know the trail to actually ride it and provide feedback.</li>
      <li>Oh and don’t forget to mention the de-skilling of folks like me :-) In the good ole days, everybody knew how to use a paper map right? And coped with paper maps right?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other than that and it raining half the time (which didn’t bother me in the slightest since I bicycle in hard rain 6 months of the year in Vancouver) the trip was fabulous.</li>
  <li>So privileged to have the physical, mental and financial wherewithal to ride 220 km with my brother and sister around the Bodensee through Austria, Germany and Switzerland (Lake Constance in English),</li>

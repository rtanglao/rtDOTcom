  <li>I agree with <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Bret in his amazing Learnable Programming post from 2012</a> which I read in 2012 and continue to re-read and learn from every year since 2012!</li>

Traditional visual environments visualize the code. They 
visualize static structure. But that’s not what we need to 
understand. We need to understand what the code is doing.</p>

  <li>What environments are there like this other than the following and that are worth trying?
    <ul>
      <li>Smalltalk (the first and still not topped it seems to me)</li>
      <li><a href="http://witheve.com/">Eve</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.lamdu.org/">Lamdu</a></li>
      <li>Others? (Clojure-like and Haskell-like languages seem to be what these things are built on but I have another list of languages I should dabble in and these two are on it together with Julia and I’ve already started tinkering with Haskell)</li>

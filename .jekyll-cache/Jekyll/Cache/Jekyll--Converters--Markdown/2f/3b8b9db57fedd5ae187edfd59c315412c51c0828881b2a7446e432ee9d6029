        <p>â€œEven last year, making and  fitting a new crown was a 2 week job requiring a specialist lab. Now my  neighbourhood dentist can do it, and I was in and out in less than 90  minutes. So the way 3D printing has come into the world is what I would call: same but faster. Faster teeth. Faster prototyping. Faster tools for injection moulding in factories.</p>

        <p>But we havenâ€™t seen the society-wide impactâ€¦So is the Internet of Things more like what we <em>got</em> with 3D printing, or more like what we <em>imagined</em> weâ€™d get? Is it same-but-more-efficient, or is it transformative?â€¦Because of the Internet of Things, this situation has inverted, it is  inside out. There is now the computer, and one of the things that it  contains is the world.-â€œ.Answer: Itâ€™s transformative because the Internet now contains the world!

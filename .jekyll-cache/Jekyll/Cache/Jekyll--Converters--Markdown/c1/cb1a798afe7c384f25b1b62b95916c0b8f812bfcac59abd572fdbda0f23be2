  <li>I was one of the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla/">250 people laid last week by Mozilla</a>.</li>
  <li>I leave with nothing but gratitude for the open web, Firefox, Thunderbird, the amazing Mozilla staff and most importantly the fab Mozilla volunteers.</li>
  <li>Really enjoyed being the Thunderbird support lead, then the Firefox Android support coordinator and finally the Firefox Support Analyst and Support Release Manager</li>
  <li>Onwards! #thanks #lucky</li>

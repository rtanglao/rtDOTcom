Canteens ¦ Land - by Andrew Curry</a> &lt;– Yes please to communal feeding centres aka <a href="https://www.findmypast.co.uk/blog/history/british-restaurants">British Restaurants from WWII</a> –&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Food is cheap. I can afford it and everyone else here can afford to buy it for themselves and their child without anxiety. There are no instances of that tightening around the throat when you do not have the money to buy food, but you are hungry and in a place that serves it. For those who have more money the price is a joyful novelty; for those who have less, the prices are a blessed relief.</code></p>

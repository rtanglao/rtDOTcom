I think tâ€Covid 2.0â€ is worse. More people are dying which is not a good thing!!!!! Masks! Donâ€™t work sick (if you have sick leave!!!) and go out sick! â€“&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Now that may seem like a bit of an odd statement given that COVID is for all intents and purposes over in most of the world. To state the obvious, COVID obviously still exists (and will forever), but it isnâ€™t the dominant factor in the economy. Thatâ€™s good for the vast majority of businesses â€” and by extension the broader economy â€” which were decimated by COVID.</code></p>

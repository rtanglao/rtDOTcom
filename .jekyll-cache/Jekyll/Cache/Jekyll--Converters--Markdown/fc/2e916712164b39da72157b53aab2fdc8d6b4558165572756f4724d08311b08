<blockquote><p>BOULDER, Colo. (April 22, 2005) -- It's a trend that's been a long time in coming: More and more people bypass news Web sites' home and section pages, instead entering a site at the article-page (or "inside-page") level.</p>

<p>The home page -- where Web designers and editors have for so long poured so much of their effort -- is no longer the be-all, end-all. You have to pay serious attention to the home page, of course, but equally important these days is the template used for article pages.</p></blockquote>

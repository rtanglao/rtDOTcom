I calculated the 1,536 dimensional embedding vector (array of floating point numbers) for each of those articles, and stored those vectors in my site’s SQLite database....Now, if I want to find related articles for a given article, I can calculate the cosine similarity between the embedding vector for that article and every other article in the database, then return the 10 closest matches by distance.</code></p>

  <li>â€œIn which I shamelessly draft off Marc Andreessenâ€™s <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">Itâ€™s Time to Build</a> essay and suggest an approach to <em>how</em>, <em>what</em>, and <em>where</em> to do the building. I also have a framework I call the builderâ€™s cone to think about it in a useful historical context.â€ &lt;â€” Read the whole thing: <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/how-what-and-where-to-build">Venkatesh Rao: How What and Where to Build</a>

      <li>I donâ€™t agree with Marc that government canâ€™t build great things but yes it is time to build things that are helpful for ALL of humanity! Venateshâ€™s riff on Marc resonates more than Marcâ€™s original essay for me!</li>

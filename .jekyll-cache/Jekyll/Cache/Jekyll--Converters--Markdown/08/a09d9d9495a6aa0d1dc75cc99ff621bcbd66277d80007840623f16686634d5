</ul>

<blockquote>
"At work with Ulysses I rarely hold presentations â€“ weâ€™re a small team, so itâ€™s mostly easy to stay up-to-date with everyoneâ€™s projects without extensive meetings. For the rare occasions I need to prepare presentations, I happily rely on Deckset. I simply take down some bullet points in Ulysses and turn them into pretty slides with Deckset in a breeze. Deckset does the layout work for me, and I donâ€™t have to fiddle around with Keynote or PowerPoint. Itâ€™s super fast and easy, especially if youâ€™re familiar with Markdown (which you are, since youâ€™re a Ulysses user).<br /><br />

Deckset turns Markdown files into presentations and works great with your favorite text editor â€“ that is, of course, Ulysses! In the following tutorial, youâ€™ll learn all you need to know to make both apps play together nicely. If you want, you can download Decksetâ€™s trial version and a sample presentation for your first attempts."

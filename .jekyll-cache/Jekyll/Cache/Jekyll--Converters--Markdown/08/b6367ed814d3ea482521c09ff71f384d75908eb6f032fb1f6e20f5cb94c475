<p>Major kudos to <a href="http://www.assemblyoftext.com/">The Regional Assembly of text folks on Main Street</a> for making it so easy and being so patient with my silly unencumbered by graphical knowledge common sense :-) questions</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read their <a href="http://www.assemblyoftext.com/button_making_station">button making FAQ and directions</a></li>
  <li>Download one of their button templates ( they have 4 sizes, I downloaded <a href="http://www.assemblyoftext.com/downloads/2.25%20Button%20Template.pdf">the 2.25 inch template</a></li>
  <li>Open the template in Photoshop (should work in other programs like GIMP or even Pages or Preview but I only tried Photoshop)</li>
  <li>Drag your button graphic (a circle shaped graphic that fits inside a 180 x 180 px square graphic seems to work for 2.25 inch, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vidbomk7p9sgr4e/0.9-25percent-mlkbutton%20copy%202.png?dl=0">here’s the Martin Luther King graphic i used</a>) into one of the circular spots on the template. Change the opacity (each dragged graphic creates a layer) of the layer to 90% in order to see if you have dragged it to the right position.</li>
  <li>Repeat above 11 times since there are 12 circles per sheet in the 2.25 inch template</li>
  <li>Create a PNG (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/214w12fmr22fl0a/MLK-2.25%20Button%20Template%281%29.png?dl=0">here’s my PNG with 12 MLK buttons</a>)</li>
  <li>Print onto normal paper as many copies of the PNG as you need  (3 copies x 12 = 36 possible buttons but you of course can do whoever many you need, we did 30 buttons so needed 3 copies of the PNG)</li>
  <li>Take the 3 sheets to The Regional Assembly of Text and they’ll show you how to use their circle cutting machine and button making machine and in &lt; 1 hour you will have 30 buttons)! Easy! and 70 cents a button in quantities of 30 ore more</li>
  <li>Here is what it looks like:<br />

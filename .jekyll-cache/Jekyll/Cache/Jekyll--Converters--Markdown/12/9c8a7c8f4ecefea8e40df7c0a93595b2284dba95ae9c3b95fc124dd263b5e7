<p>Here’s how we (me and the fab <a href="https://twitter.com/dale42">Dale</a>!) as of this writing record <a href="https://audioboom.com/over40invan">over 40 in Vancouver</a>, our 10 minute weekly podcast about living and being old-ish :-) in Vancouver:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 <a href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/b8dd84773f83092c/">Audio-Technica ATR2100-USB Cardioid Dynamic USB/XLR mics</a> are plugged using XLR cables into a</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.roland.ca/products/duo-capture_ex/">Roland Duo Capture EX USB Interface</a> that is battery powered with 3 AA batteries and we monitor using <a href="https://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-MDR7506/">Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones</a>.</li>
  <li>The USB Interface is plugged into an USB to Lightning cable which is plugged into</li>
  <li>an iPhone 7 Plus running the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/audioboo/id305204540?mt=8">Audioboom iOS app</a> (there’s an Android app too)</li>
  <li>We record using the Audioboom iOS App and upload directly to Audioboom’s servers. No muss no fuss, no editing! Our 10 minute podcast is usually live in less than 1 hour (usually less than 45 minutes!) from ordering our coffee to recording to being available for your listening pleasure on the internet!</li>
  <li>Future possible enhancements:
    <ul>
      <li>I’d love to use 2 bluetooth mics or some other wireless mics and get rid of the USB interface</li>
      <li>I’d love to record into a simple iOS podcast recording and light editing app (not Garageband) and do some minor audio editing before uploading to Audioboom!</li>
    </ul>

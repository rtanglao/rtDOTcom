I am sure it‚Äôs only a a matter of time before somebody figures out how to do this on Mac OS X.  Looking forward to Uni-Podcasting (podcasting to one person at a time!)! Stuart rocks!

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>This Skype experiment confirms a number of possibilities.:
</p><ul><li> Add background music (radio) to your Skype calls, personalizing the experience.</li>
<li> Run a second Skype line so your friends can hear what's playing on your iPod, even when you aren't home.</li>
<li> Broadcast podcast audio using Skype saving bandwidth, and eliminating buffering and streaming issues.</li>
<li>Demonstrate infomercials. Examples: snow report, customer update, daily briefing, etc. Access direct from website via callto: tags.
</li><li> Note when we automate the recording selection from a website you will listen to Skype playback your request. This will be HUGE!
</li><li> What are the implications for Streaming Media models? Why wait for the buffering? What is tomorrow's transit mechanism?</li>
</ul>
<p>From a Podcast perspective distributing podcasts via SkypeCalls provides the the opportunity for the Podcaster to know who's listening and even whether they listened to the whole thing. Statistics are a big deal! Further automation could enable one to listen and then via a text message to request a full file download. Bye Bye bandwidth problems and hello Podcast communications transport mechanism. No ports to open, no special FTP. Sounds perfect for when you get 30 people listening for a podcast if you are lucky!

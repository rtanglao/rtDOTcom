Of course, you need a free Bloglines account.  If you donâ€™t mind or want a server based RSS reader, I definitely would recommend Bloglines.  It is one of the best hosted blog readers.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>You can create an unlimited number of special Bloglines email addresses that are tied to your Bloglines account. The email addresses show up as subscriptions in your My Blogs page, and email sent to those email addresses appears as new items.

When you create a Bloglines email address, a subscription is added to your account. If you unsubscribe from that subscription, the email address becomes invalid and mail sent to it will bounce.

Email subscriptions are great for announce-only or broadcast mailing lists that don't provide RSS feeds. They are also useful as temporary email addresses.</blockquote>

  <li>This is straightforward. I just use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">editing over ssh feature</a> to enter the SSH connection command (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -i ~/.ssh/wsl2.pub roland@somehost.tcp.ngrok.io -p &lt;someport&gt;</code>) in Visual Studio Code (and of course I could always use emacs to edit over ssh which I’ve done for decades!).</li>
  <li>And I use the terminal feature to trigger a jekyll rebuild and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">surge</code> to upload my blog and git all in Visual Studio Code’s terminal.</li>
  <li>Finally I have another ngrok tunnel running that maps port 4000 to port 80 to see the rendered draft version at: https://somejekyllsubdomainofmydraftblog.ngrok.io/</li>
  <li>Super geeky :-) but then I can edit on any of my 5 laptops (including my MacBook Air) because this recipe will work on any computer that runs Visual Studio Code.</li>
  <li>Question: Does Typora or any other nice SSH editor work over SSH? VS Code is fine but not nearly as nice as Typora!</li>

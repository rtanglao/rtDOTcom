But the threat is not over. Although vaccination and prior Covid exposure lessen the risk, people can still get long Covid, even a severe, debilitating version like mine. ... As for me, my symptoms â€” my brushstrokes â€” are more intense than ever before. ... The recent days on my data canvas are thick with color. Much of the slight progress I made this summer is gone, and many of my fears have intensified. I do not know what is going to happen next. ... But I can hope. ... I hope one day I will be able to take walks again, snowboard, sit with my friends and eat at a restaurant, travel to my home country, be pain-free and simply enjoy a day in the sun without symptoms or fear. I hope one day I will get back to the person I used to be.</code></p>

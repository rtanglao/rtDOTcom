  <li>Amazing conversation on the future of media and journalism conversation tonight with Erin Millar of Discourse <a href="https://www.frontfundr.com/Company/discourse_media">(crowd fund them now for $250 by Dec 21, 2017</a>), Jay Rosen of <a href="http://pressthink.org/">PressThink</a> and <a href="https://thecorrespondent.com/">The Correspondent</a> (future USA arm of Dutch <a href="https://decorrespondent.nl/">De Correspondent</a>)</li>
  <li>I was lucky enough to meet Jay at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BloggerCon">BloggerCon</a> in Boston in 2003. Ah the good ole days when we didnâ€™t worry about bad actors manipulating our thoughts, hearts and votes algorithmically through social media and we believed reality and facts were a valid criteria for news :-)</li>

Gods: Super-intelligent, artificial entities that do things autonomously. 2. Interns: Supervised copilots that collaborate with experts, focusing on grunt work. 3. Cogs: Functions optimized to perform a single task extremely well, usually as part of a pipeline or interface. 4. Toys, a subcategory of Interns defined by their usage by non-experts. Toys have a high tolerance for errors because theyâ€™re not being relied on for much beyond entertainment.</code></p>

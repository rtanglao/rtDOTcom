<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On StackOverflow, a questioner with a bunch of data frames (already existing as objects 
in their environment) wanted to split each of them into two based on some threshold 
being met, or not, on a specific column. Every one of the data frames had this column 
in it. Their thought was that theyâ€™d write a loop, or use lapply after putting the data 
frames in a list, and write a function that split the data fames, named each one, and 
wrote them out as separate objects in the environment.

Hereâ€™s a tidyverse solution that avoids the need to explicitly write loops, using 
map instead of lapply. (I have no particular dislike of lapply et fam, Iâ€™ll just be 
working with the tidyverse equivalents.)

  <li>It’s 2016 and we still don’t have printing recognition as good as the last model of the Newton. No disrespect to <a href="http://myscript.com/nebo/">Nebo</a> which does a great job on the iPad Pro 9.7 and presumably the iPad Pro 12 inch but it should be part of the OS and not involve a hard to carry, bulky stylus!</li>
  <li>Why?</li>
  <li>Maybe we don’t need it? Maybe voice and touch keyboards and other UX gestures will be good enough. That’s what I would like. Alternative UX methods like voice and touch for quick snippets and some sort of keyboard for long writing. Can’t  wait for that day!</li>

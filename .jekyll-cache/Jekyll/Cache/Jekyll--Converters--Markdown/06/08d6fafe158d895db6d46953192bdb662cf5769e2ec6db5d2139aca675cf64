My old <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> iPhoto workflow used to be:
<br />1. set tags and access control (public or private) using web interface
<br />2. email photos from iPhoto
<br />which was a error prone process to say the least.
</p>
<p>
Now, I do everything with the iPhoto by using the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups_topic.gne?id=5306">Flickr iPhoto upload plugin</a> and the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/kenferry/Software/docs/KeywordAssistant.html">iPhoto Keyword assistant</a> which automagically completes tags so you don't have to type them in labouriously by hand (thanks for suggesting it <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a>!).  If you have a Mac and are a Flickr user, check it out!

<br />Changes
<br />
<br />Now supports arbitrary reordering of images via drag and drop Better supports unicode text everywhere (sorry about that!) New "Add tag to All" feature - adds one particular tag to all images, preserving others.

  <li>Surface Book 2 Drivers were re-installed by Hamilton again Monday May 7, 2018 &lt;â€“ this is getting ridiculous :-) oh well the laptop still works well especially Ubuntu in the Windows Subsystem for Linux</li>
  <li>See <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/05/02/p1-hamilton-uninstalled-my-surface-book2-wifi-drivers-1may2018/">Hamilton uninstalled and re-installed my wifi drivers on May 1, 2018: letâ€™s see if this fixes the wifi not working after about 1-2 weeks problem on my surface book 2</a></li>

  <li>I guess Marvell, M*crosoft, somebody, anybody :-)  need to fix this !</li>

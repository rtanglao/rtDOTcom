  <li>Prediction: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/01/08/p1-david-deutsch-we-need-a-breakthrough-philosophy-how-brains-create-explanatory-knowledge/">Artificial General Intelligence</a> wonâ€™t happen before 2029! Until then we are stuck with brute force. Brute force will get us self driving transit in dense urban centres (bring it on! self guided buses and self guided taxis controlled by proactive government regulation not by the â€œmarketâ€ which will s*ck at this) but not Teslaâ€™s dream or R2D2 !</li>
  <li>Of course since Iâ€™m an old fart :-) , then this prediction will probably be wrong. Maybe we will get an AGI breakthrough before 2029!</li>

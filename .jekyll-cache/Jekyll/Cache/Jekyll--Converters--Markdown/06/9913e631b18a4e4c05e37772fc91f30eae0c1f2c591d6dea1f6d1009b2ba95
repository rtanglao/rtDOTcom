I"s<p><b>UPDATE</b>: The URLs are not specific to Technorati, they can be any URL. Technorati please update your docs because this isn't clear IMHO.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you use the pages at http://technorati.com/tag/ as your destination, we know what this means. You could also use another domain that has tag-specific urls, like flickr, del.icio.us, or wikipedia. The assumption the technorati spider makes is that the last path component of the url is the tag, so http://apple.com/ipod would even work.</p>

<p>We think that linking to our tag collator is a useful thing to do here, but they are your links and you can do as you wish.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great feature! I guess itâ€™s not in beta :-) ? If it was, I would suggest adding these features for the 1.0:</p>
<ul><li><strike>using a non Technorati specific URL, how about something that's non commercial, like folksonomy.com or something instead of technorati.com. What happens if Technorati goes out of business or the domain name is usurped by a sp*mmer or somebody evil?</strike>
</li>
<li>adding tags for all systems that support categories in their  RSS (why should just Blogware, MT, Wordpress, TypePad, Radio have all the fun? What about Manila, Drupal et al speaking selfishly of course!). I don't see any technical obstacle to this!</li> 
<li>supporting the tags from the <a href="http://topicexchange.com/">Internet topic exchange</a> and <a href="http://matt.blogs.it/specs/ENT/1.0/">ENT</a> i.e. respect prior art, please!</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>The photos come from our friends at Flickr. Flickr is a great photo sharing community. If you'd like your photos to appear on our tag pages, join Flickr and post your photos there. And remember to tag 'em!
</p>
<p>The links come from the nice folks at Del.icio.us. Del.icio.us is a web-based bookmarks manager. If you'd like to contribute links to Technorati Tag pages, you can join Del.icio.us, post and tag some links.
</p>
<p>The rest of the Technorati Tag pages is made up of blog posts. And those come from you! Anyone with a blog can contribute to Technorati Tag pages. There are two ways to contribute:
</p>
    <li> If your blog software supports categories and RSS/Atom (like Movable Type, WordPress, TypePad, Blogware, Radio), just use the included category system and make sure you're publishing RSS/Atom and we'll automatically include your posts! Your categories will be read as tags.
</li>   <li> If your blog software does not support those things, don't worry, you can still play. To add your post to a Technorati Tag page, all you have to do is "tag" your post by including a special link. Like so:<br />
      &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/[tagname]" rel="tag"&gt;[tagname]&lt;/a&gt;<br />
      The [tagname] can be anything, but it should be descriptive. Please only use tags that are relevant to the post. No need to include the brackets.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Why don’t I attend conferences or listen to podcasts? Answer: too homogeneous and too long</li>
  <li>I’d rather talk to people in the lobby of a conference or at a cafe then listen to a talk for 20-60 minutes.</li>
  <li>I’d rather people summarize their stuff in the 1st 10 slides (or less! I bet most folks talks could be 5 slides and most podcasts could be 10 minutes or less) and talk for 5 or 10 minutes and then do a long Q&amp;A (and put the long form detailed stuff in a wiki page or blog post that they link to in those slides)</li>
  <li>I’d rather not have more of the same sorts of the same people who are always on the radio and in the books I read and in the media I consume when I can easily find more diverse voices on the internet without going to a conference and without enduring a &gt;30 minute podcast!</li>
  <li>Having said that conferences with diverse folks and speakers are still appealing and so are short podcasts (although short podcasts seem to be very very scarce!).</li>

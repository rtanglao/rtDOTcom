For how long? 5-10 years or more if we are lucky?!? â€“&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">El*n M*skâ€™s antics at Tw*tter have been a wake-up call to many. They are beginning to realize that the platform monopolists and the surveillance capitalists are at war with us â€” citizens of the world.

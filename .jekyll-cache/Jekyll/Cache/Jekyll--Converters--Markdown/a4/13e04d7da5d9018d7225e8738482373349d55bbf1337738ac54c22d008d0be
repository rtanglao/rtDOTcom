<ul>
  <li>Vancouver has a whole set of traffic calmed streets which are not nearly as good as AAA, physically separated bicycle paths but far better than nothing especially for low intensity slower rides and safer now if you are as always paranoid and don’t try to race everywhere.</li>
  <li>Beware of intersections (e.g. 37th and Fraser) because pedestrians or folks with dogs don’t keep their distance! I am not sure why? is it because they have no concept of distance, are oblivious or just don’t care?</li>
  <li>Avoid (except on rainy days or early in the morning i.e. before 8a.m.) and in no particular order

      <li>Arbutus Greenway (way too crowded before and just kr*zy now)</li>

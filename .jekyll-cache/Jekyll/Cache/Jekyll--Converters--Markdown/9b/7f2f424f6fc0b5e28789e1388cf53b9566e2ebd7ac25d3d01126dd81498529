<p>I am currently borrowing <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a>’s old <a href="http://www.mobiledia.com/reviews/sonyericsson/t610/page1.html">Sony Ericsson T616</a> (thanks!).  I was planning on buying a camera phone in July or August for my 40th birthday.  Should I wait for the 6630? I don’t really want to wait that long but it appears to have what I  want: a really good 1 Mega Pixel camera!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://press.nokia.com/PR/200406/948877_5.html">Nokia - Nokia goes full speed ahead with world’s smallest 3G megapixel phone - Press Releases - Press - About Nokia</a>:</p>

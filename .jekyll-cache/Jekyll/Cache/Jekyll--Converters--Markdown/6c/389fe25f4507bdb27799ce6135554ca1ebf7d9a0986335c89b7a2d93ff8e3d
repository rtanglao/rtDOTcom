  <li>â€œSloan reminds us that programming can be â€“ is â€“ more than a line on a  resume. It is something that everyone can do,  and want to do, for a lot of different reasons. It would  be great if programming â€œwere marbled deeply into domesticity and comfort, nerdiness and curiosity, health and loveâ€ in  the way that cooking is. That is what makes Computing for All  <strong>really</strong> worth doing.â€ &lt;â€” read Eugeneâ€™s  <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2020-02.html#e2020-02-18T16_00_24.htm">Programming Feels like home</a> which is a fantastic riff on <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/02/16/p1-robin-sloan-an-app-home-cooked-meal/">Robin Sloan: An app can be a home-cooked meal</a></li>
  <li>And like cooking you donâ€™t have to cook and some donâ€™t want to ever and thatâ€™s fine too (you canâ€™t do everything but like cooking I think itâ€™s worth a try at some point in your life)!</li>

Some quotes:
    <ul>
      <li>” One of the ways we can do this is by lowering the energy demand of the  digital products and services we’re designing, making it more accessible to people with slower internet connections or on older devices. For <em>Branch</em> we wanted to design something that still looked designed, and worked at a low bandwidth environment, but didn’t end up looking too anodyne.”</li>
      <li>“<em>Branch</em> was also designed to be ‘Demand Responsive’ to adapt to  and reflect the physical infrastructure of the internet and the energy  behind it. Utilising data from a grid intensity API and the user’s  location, <em>Branch</em> has different interface designs that are shown dependent on the current energy demand and fossil fuels on the grid  where the user is.  “</li>

I")<p>&lt;armchair ceo&gt; <br />One sentence: “Nokia buy ShoZu”</p>
<p>Fix its memory issues, make it work with absolutely everything (it already works with many many sites) and then make it part of S60 <br />&lt;/armchair ceo&gt;</p>
<p>This Twango acquisition makes no sense to me; buy a service nobody uses!?! A ShoZu acquisition makes much more sense; it's a great albeit flawed app (S60 memory issues) that works with all the cool services like flickr, blip.tv, any MetaWeblogAPI enabled blog, etc, etc.</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>If Nokia’s tag line is Connecting People, why are they going out of their way to develop new stand-alone services, rather than working with what’s already present and being used by communities globally. They could really just focus enabling the experience from Mobile to web and back. From a user perspective, I would much rather have an application or service that could talk with everything else I use to make it simple for content to go back and forth. This would make it easy for me and easy for my friends to stay in touch. We already know Facebook is working on the connection with the desktop and Jaiku, Facebook and even Plaxo offer ways to have content from other syndicate-able sources appear in your profile, but no one has come up with way to link with your mobile.</blockquote>

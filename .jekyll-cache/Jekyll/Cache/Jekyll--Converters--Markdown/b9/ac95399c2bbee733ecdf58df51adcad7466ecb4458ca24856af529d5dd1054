LOL! &lt;â€“ <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The month of May is recognized as Asian Heritage month in Canada; this time, I am writing about the Filipino-Mexican connection, and sharing a recipe from the Philippines that could almost be Mexican.   ... Green pods of Phaseolus vulgaris, known as ejotes (in Spanish in Mexico, judÃ­as verdes, in Spain) â€“ sitaw  (Filipino) â€“ string/green beans (English), one of the many contributions of Mexico to the world, are the featured vegetable in this recipe.  Pork or chicken are common meat additions, but I chose fried pork rinds to continue my chicharrones theme from previous posts.  As a snack,  fried pork rinds are ubiquitous around the world, known as khaep mu in Thailand, cracklings in the US,  scratchings in the UK, etc., but in Mexico and The Philippines, they definitely came from Spain, called chicharrÃ³n in Spanish, and chicharon in Filipino/Tagalog.  Finally, red hot peppers are optional, but I included some to enhance the culinary fusion of the dish.</code></p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Yahoo gathered a small group of bloggers, press and others at Sauce in San Francisco tonight to announce the launch of two new RSS products. They have integrated an RSS reader directly into Yahoo Mail Beta, and are expanding Alerts to include RSS feeds. </p> <p>These are significant new products, aimed squarely at new and mainstream RSS users. The service is not live as of the time I am posting this. I've added a screen shot picture from the live demo.</p></blockquote>

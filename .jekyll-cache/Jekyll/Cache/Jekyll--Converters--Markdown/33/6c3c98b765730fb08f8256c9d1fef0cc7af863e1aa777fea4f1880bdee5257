It needs to be separate from all other areas of work in order to get different rules for itself. After all, objects do not suffer. There is a very direct connection between explaining the experiences of the people I care about in tech and explaining to the people in tech about the people I care about. And because of who I am and who I love, I cannot be Technical here and now for the exact same reasons that I could not be smart back when I was fifteen and working instead of going to school no matter how obvious the proof of smartness was. In some systems otherness causes smartness to dissolve because otherness is more useful to the system than the smartness. It is therefore not very difficult for me in this system to understand why software looks at me and gets surprised when I know what code is, and then gets angry when I donâ€™t care about code all that much and instead care about the people so much more. Caring about the code is supposed to be what you do to earn being here and I refuse that. I cannot be Technical because I put my caring, my hope, my love, and the center of my universe somewhere else.</code></p>

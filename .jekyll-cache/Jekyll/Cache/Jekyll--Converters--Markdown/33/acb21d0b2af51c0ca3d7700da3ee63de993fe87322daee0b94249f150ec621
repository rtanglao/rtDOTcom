<blockquote>
  <p>The notion that fathers wander away from their families owing to some gnawing sense of existential dislocation‚Äîsome humiliating certainty of their own uselessness or usurpation‚Äîis especially pungent when one takes into account the enormous gender gap in housework and child-rearing in heterosexual marriages. According to the Gender Equity Policy Institute, mothers who work full time do almost twice as much household labor as fathers. Research by the Nobel-winning economist Claudia Goldin has suggested that married men‚Äôs disinclination toward housework and other ‚Äúdraggy business of family life‚Äù may be holding back birth rates, which should pique the interest of Republican pronatalists such as J. D. Vance.</p>

  <p>The deeper one sinks into our nation‚Äôs alleged man-boy problem and its potential solutions, the more the woman reader may begin to feel something stronger than resentment or intellectual disdain. She may begin to feel a chauvinistic gratitude in her sex. The familiar flatness of feeling a little degraded seems preferable to the anger, entitlement, and alienation that (we are told over and over) gnaws away at so many male specimens. What a gift it is, really, to have no choice in the matter. To have to move out of your parents‚Äô house, to show up for your shift, to change the diaper, not because any of it is gender-affirming but because life is full of tasks that need doing, and you are the person who does them. At least then you know who you are.</p>

<p>Read the whole thing: <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2025/01/10/opinion/trump-threats-traitors">Max Fawcett:: TrÊŠmpâ€™s threats expose the trğŸ„itors in our midst Â¦ Canadaâ€™s National Observer: Climate News</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why are so many CğŸ„nadian CğŸ„nservatives welcoming, or at least entertaining, TrÊŠmpâ€™s advances? Because JÊŠstin TrÊŠdeau made them do it, apparently. His now infamous remark about how â€œthere is no core identity, no mainstream in Canadaâ€ to fellow Canadian Guy Lawson in a 2015 New York Times magazine  profile, one that spoke to his fatherâ€™s vision for our national culture and its unique ability to embrace difference and diversity, has somehow become an invitation to disloyalty and cowardice. Never mind that it was an attempt to articulate a more inclusive view of our national identity, one that clearly set us apart from America. For many CğŸ„nservatives in Canada, TrÊŠdeauâ€™s belief in a â€œpğŸ„stnğŸ„tionalâ€ future was all the excuse they ever needed to betray their own country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is by far the most pitiful example yet of TrÊŠdeau-derangement syndrome, and thatâ€™s a category with plenty of strong contenders. I assure you that there is nothing any future government could say or do that would weaken my commitment to this country and its future. My loyalty and patriotism arenâ€™t a function of whoâ€™s in power at the moment, and they certainly arenâ€™t about to be overridden by petty partisanship, much less a misunderstood, decade-old quote in the New York Times. If only the folks who had spent so much time and energy over the last few years publicly professing their supposed love for this country felt the same.</p>

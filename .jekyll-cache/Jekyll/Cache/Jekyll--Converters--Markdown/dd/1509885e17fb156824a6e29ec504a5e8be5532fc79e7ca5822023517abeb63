  <li>I learned a new word today “microcopy” - <a href="http://unmatchedstyle.com/news/microcopy-why-is-it-so-important.php">“The small bits of text/copy that help instruct and alleviate the concerns of your users.”</a></li>
  <li>The microcopy reference was in <a href="https://twitter.com/nredmond/status/818220288001220608">Niamh Redmond’s tweet</a>: “I’ve learned throughout my career that the most significant UX performance gains often come down to microcopy.”</li>
  <li>The following quote is from a fabulous article by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnapao">Johna Paolino</a> <a href="https://medium.com/startup-grind/google-home-vs-alexa-56e26f69ac77#.hedup4svd">“Google Home vs Alexa
Two Simple User Experience Design Gestures that Delighted a Female User”</a>:</li>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
"<br />
Alexa responds to her name only. Google’s product must be triggered with a “hey Google” or “ok Google”. By requiring these introductory words as triggers, Google has forced an element of conversation. The experience difference here is huge! When I return to Alexa now I feel authoritative.<br />

<p><strong>END QUOTE</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>From that article I reach my thrilling conclusion: <strong>why should robots or assistants be gendered? In fact they shouldn’t! So Apple please rename “Siri” to “Apple” and Amazon please rename “Alexa” to “Amazon</strong>”!</li>
</ul>

I"›<p>Must listen, even if you don't want to make money because there's a lot of insight about the web in 2005 and how it works and of course the cool questions from the Vancouver crew: <a href="http://bmannconsulting.com/">Boris</a>, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/">Darren</a> and <a href="http://willpate.org/">Will</a>.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://blog.glennf.com/mtarchives/004744.html">GlennLog: Blog Business Summit Speech in QuickTime with Slides</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>It took a little doing, but you can watch my presentation on The Entrepreneurial Blog from the recent Blog Business Summit. I managed to sync up the audio that was recorded to MP3 with my slides. The intra-slide sync is a little off: the bullet points and reveals aren't perfectly timed to my talk. But it's not bad. The whole file is 25 MB and in QuickTime. It might be interesting to those of you working on blogs that make money or are considering how to start an editorial blog from the ground up that has a revenue component. My co-presenter Steve Broback, the conference organizer, pipes in a few times with good analysis, too.</p></blockquote>

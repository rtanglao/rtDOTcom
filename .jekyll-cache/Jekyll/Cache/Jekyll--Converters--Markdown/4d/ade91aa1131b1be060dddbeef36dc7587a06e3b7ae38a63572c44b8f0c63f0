She begins this process by reminding herself of ways she changed last year’s by reverse engineering a few of the differences between Official-lastYear and Dept-lastYear. She then looks at the same portions of Official-thisYear to see if those same changes can easily be made, given her department’s current needs.</code> &lt;– from 2014 paper <a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/45840147/Future_of_end-user_software_engineering_20160521-660-itern8-libre.pdf">Future of End-User Software Engineering:Beyond the Silos</a> &lt;– I bet this URL will break. Perhaps Machine Learning can help enduser software engineering?!?!</p>

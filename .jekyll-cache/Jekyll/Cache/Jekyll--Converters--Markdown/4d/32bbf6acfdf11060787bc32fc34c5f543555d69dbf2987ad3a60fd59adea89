I"›<p> I&#39;ve been trying out <a href="http://comvu.com/">ComVu</a>&#39;s webcast software for the N93, <a href="http://comvu.com/comvu/presscenter/News010807.htm">PocketCaster</a>. More about that later but I did learn that there is no hardware limitation preventing you from using<a href="/rt/archives/2006/11/11/n93-review-part-5-cant-swivel-screen-so-i-can-take-high-res-videos-of-myself"> the video camera with the screen facing you (aka &quot;ego videoblog mode&quot;)</a> since it works with PocketCaster. </p>
<p> LazyWeb: please provide a S60 executable to do this (maybe I can do this in Python?). Better yet Nokia upgrade your firmware to enable this. </p>

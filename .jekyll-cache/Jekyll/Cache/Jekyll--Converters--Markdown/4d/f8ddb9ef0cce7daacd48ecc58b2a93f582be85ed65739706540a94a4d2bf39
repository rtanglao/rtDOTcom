<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>We don't need deregulation. We need better designed regulation.

The major rework we need isn't some math theory, some kind of Paxos for Capitalism, or 
Paxos for Government. The sad, boring fact is that no fundamental advances in math 
or computer science are needed to solve these problems.

All we need is to build distributed systems that work. That means decentralized bulk 
activity, hierarchical regulation.

As a society, we are so much richer, so much luckier, than we have ever been.

It's all so much easier, and harder, than they've been telling you.

Let's build what we already know is right.`

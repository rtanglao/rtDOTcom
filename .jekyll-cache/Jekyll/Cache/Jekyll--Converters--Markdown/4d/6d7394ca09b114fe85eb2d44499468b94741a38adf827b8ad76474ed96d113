I"8<p>In exchange for helping me debug the <a href="http://www.qoop.com/">Qoop</a> service with lots of <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a> photos (1120 to be precise), the Qoop people sent me a complimentary 13"x20" poster that I made using the 1120 photos I have posted of the kid to our private family flickr account since May. The Qoop poster is fantastic (I'd post a photo but even shrunk down you can still tell it's the kid so I can't since it violates my policy of letting the kid decide if he wants his photos online)!</p>
<p>The photos are a bit small (since they had to fit 1120) but it's a great time capsule of the kid's summer and it's only $US10 + shipping.</p>
<p>I know what I am getting my family for Christmas: Qoop books and posters of the kid's flickr pics! Highly recommended for flickr addicts!</p>

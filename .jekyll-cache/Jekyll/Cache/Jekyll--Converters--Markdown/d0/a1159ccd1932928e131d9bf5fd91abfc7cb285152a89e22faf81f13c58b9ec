<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When I was at Nokia and we shipped a Symbian product and it was bad, in its worst incarnation we knew that <strong>if we just flipped the switch, we could move 2.5 to three million units -- overnight, no matter how bad the product,</strong>" he tells me. "That was Nokia. That was Nokia's brand, we knew we could count on that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And now look at it -- they flipped the switch and oh, 200,000 [Windows Phone] units out of the gate. Huh? Only selling in the US, under AT&amp;T's moniker. If you can't flip the switch like that, Nokia's dead and devalued."</p>

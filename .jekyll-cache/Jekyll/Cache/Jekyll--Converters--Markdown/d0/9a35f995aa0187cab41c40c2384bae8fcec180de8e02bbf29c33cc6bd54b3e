  <p>Atmospheric computing is about building an interoperable world. A cloud in that world can be big or small. It doesnâ€™t matter. A bigger cloud will do bigger things, and a smaller clouds will do smaller things. But theyâ€™ll still talk.</p>

  <p>We need a collectivist answer to Big Tech. Iâ€™m not just interested in the battles of yesterday; if now is the time of AI, I want a personal AI running on my personal cloud. There is zero reason for us to all become subservient clients to American corporations. The model can change.</p>

  <p>The path to a sovereign tech stack is via commodification. The AT Protocol stack is akin to Backend-as-a-Service; it standardizes identity, oauth flows, permissioning, data flows, and more. We are now working with the IETF to form a Working Group [4] and I believe a standard cloud platform is emerging in these specs.</p>

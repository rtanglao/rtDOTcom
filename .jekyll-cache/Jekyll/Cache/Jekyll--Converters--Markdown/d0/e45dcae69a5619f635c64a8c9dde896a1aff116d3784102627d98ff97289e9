  <li>Glitch is recommended always even if you aren‚Äôt working from home (WFH)!</li>
  <li>Glitch‚Äôs guide: <a href="https://glitch.com/remote/">Glitch for remote work</a> is also  highly recommended</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve worked from home on and off over the last 15 years (usually only for 1 or 2 early or late meetings) but mostly at an office.</li>
  <li>Zoom is fantastic and so is slack and matrix, much better than irc and skype</li>
  <li>Whatever the toolset is, I can add the following (but others like <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/LoveInATimeOfCoronaVirusTipsTricksAndBestPracticesForWorkingRemotely.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>, <a href="https://andyabramson.blogs.com/working_anywhere/">Andy Abramson</a> and many others have far more comprehensive WFH advice):
    <ul>
      <li>Assume positive intent!!!!</li>
      <li>Get a great microphone (USB wired headset form Plantronics or Logitech is my recommendation since they are rock solid or if you must wireless than fancy bluetooth like AirPods; I don‚Äôt use AirPods but many colleagues do and their audio quality is much better than the cheapie bluetooth headsets</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt use the wired headset that comes with your iPhone or Android phone (if you do test it weekly because they fail silently!)!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Get into an ‚Äúoffice‚Äù routine: e.g. shower, change, put on your office badge, and go into ‚Äúoffice‚Äù mode.</li>
    </ul>

I"Û<p>Check out <a href="http://commons.ucalgary.ca/weblogs/decentralists/rolandtanglao/lessonsFromWeblogsAndDaveWiner.html">Lessons learned from Weblogs.com fiasco</a> that I wrote on the <a href="http://commons.ucalgary.ca/weblogs/decentralists">NMC 2004 Decentralist blog</a>.</p>

<p>A postscript to that piece: Having read the roughly 150 comments and listened to Daveâ€™s audio blog AND having met Dave and recently had some glitches with the free blogs that I hosted going down due a domain name that I didnâ€™t control expiring, it is clear to me that Daveâ€™s heart is in the right place and that, other than NOT posting a brief heads up about weblogs.com going down on the web somewhere, Dave has done the right thing.</p>

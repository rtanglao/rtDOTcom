  <li>Wavelengh the micro.blog podcasting app doesnâ€™t support stereo recording through the lightning port unlike <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/08/01/p1-voice-record-pro-records-stereo-through-ios-lightning-port/">Voice Record Pro which I blogged about yesterday</a>
Pity it would have been great to have an all-in-one solution that can record 2 microphones, 1 left, 1 right, like AudioBoom!</li>

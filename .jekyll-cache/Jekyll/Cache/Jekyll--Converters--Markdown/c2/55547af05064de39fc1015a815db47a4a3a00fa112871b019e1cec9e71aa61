I"•<p>Iâ€™d rather have a world where people who arenâ€™t great writers blog and write every day even if they donâ€™t improve.  Better to live in a world where people express themselves than not!</p>

<p>And I think over the long haul (measured in years) that 99% of the people will become better writers.  I certainly have improved!</p>

<p>From <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/03/20/assets">Most valuable asset [dive into mark]</a>&lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I grew up being taught, believing, and teaching others to believe that there were only two things you needed to do to become a good writer:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Read every day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write every day</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>But now we have thousands of webloggers who read other webloggers every day, and who themselves write every day, and theyâ€™re not getting any better at writing. Some people become better writers through weblogging, but if you look around youâ€™ll have to agree that many donâ€™t. They may fancy themselves as writers, or even journalists, because after all theyâ€™ve been writing every day for years. But their latest stuff is just as immature and nonsensical as their old stuff. They canâ€™t put words together. (Whatâ€™s so good about putting words together? Itâ€™s traditionally considered advantageous for a writer.)</p>

<p>This bothers me enormously. First, the mind-boggling lack of self-knowledge required to write every day and not realize that you write badly. But more important, the fact that there is obviously a secret third ingredient required for becoming a good writer. You need to read every dayâ€¦ and write every dayâ€¦ and X. But I donâ€™t know what X is, and obviously my teachers didnâ€™t know either. They had it, but they didnâ€™t know it. Daily writing is not our most valuable asset. So what is it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;<strong>UNQUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <li><a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021PREM0023-000578">The circuit breaker lockdown that started March 30, 2021 in</a> BC is over and indoor dining is allowed again as of May 25, 2021. When will that be? I’m hoping for October i.e. Canadian Thanksgiving or slightly earlier!</li>
  <li>I still won’t be indoor dining until over 50% of the population has 2 vaccinations even though it’s allowed now?</li>
  <li>Why? aerosols, lack of filtration and ventilation in 99% of the restaurants and variants #ymmv :-)</li>
  <li>Stay healthy!:4000</li>
</ul>

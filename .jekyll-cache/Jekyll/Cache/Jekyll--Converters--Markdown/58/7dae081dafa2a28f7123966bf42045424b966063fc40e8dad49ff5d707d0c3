Last week I received the cool DT-22 Tripod from Nokia Blogger Relations. First impressions: a great tool for videoblogging and like <a href="http://ipadventures.com/?p=1643">Ken</a> wrote, the base is a great little adapter for use with other tripods.

Come see the DT-22 this Wednesday at <a href="http://bryght.com/events/massive-2007">Massive 2007</a> at the Bryght booth where I will use the DT-22 to videoblog 3 minute videoblogs with show-goers.

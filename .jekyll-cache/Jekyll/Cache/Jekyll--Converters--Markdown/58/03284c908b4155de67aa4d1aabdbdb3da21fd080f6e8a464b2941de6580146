I"ÿ<p>tl;dr: Short links to other sites break the internet so I wonâ€™t have those, but there will be tags</p>

<h2 id="pontifications">Pontifications</h2>

<p>Following up from <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/07/p1-No-email-newsletter-and-other-accoutrements/">yesterdayâ€™s no newsletter and other stuff I wonâ€™t have</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wonâ€™t have shortened links to other sites so I can track if you click on them. That breaks the internet because it slows things down and really do I need that info? Do you? I can see the need for short links to your stuff to put on a bus or billboard :-) but thatâ€™s it!</li>
  <li>There will be tags like flickr, and instagram and twitter, Iâ€™ve just been too lazy :-) to figure out how to do them.</li>
</ul>

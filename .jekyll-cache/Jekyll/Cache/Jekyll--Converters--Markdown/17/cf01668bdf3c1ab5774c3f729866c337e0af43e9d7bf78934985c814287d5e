So many tools so little time :-) â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: `LIDA (Dibia, 2023) is an open-source tool that enables goal- based data visualization generation by generating, refin-ing, filtering, and executing code to produce visualizations.It also includes an infographer module that creates data-faithful, stylized graphics using image generation models. The system supports multiple Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair, for visualization generation. ChatGPTâ€™s code interpreter API (Cheng et al., 2023) lets users upload their dataset and pose queries in natural language (e.g., analyze the trend of renewable energy over time). Then the model generates a code snippet for this task and executes it to generate a plot. Chat2Vis (Maddigan &amp;Susnjak, 2023) and ChartGPT (Tian et al., 2024) are someâ€¦</p>

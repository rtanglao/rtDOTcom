  <li>Google to demand regular Android security patches from OEMs:<a href="https://vowe.net/archives/017137.html">via the fabulous vowe.net: Dave Kleidermacher who leads mobile security at Google:‚Äù‚Ä¶this will really lead to a massive increase in the number of devices, and users, receiving regular security patches‚Äù</a></li>
  <li>Oh really, how massive? all OEMs that use Google Play? 50% 75%, 100%, of the OEMs?</li>
  <li>By when? 2020, 2021, end of 2019?</li>
  <li>I want to believe :-) but I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll believe it when S*msung agrees to this. Until then Android is one massive security headache except for Pixel devices.</li>

      <li>How to train models that achieve state of the art results in:
        <ul>
          <li>Computer vision: Image classification (e.g. classify pet photos by  breed), and image localization and detection (e.g. find where the  animals in an image are)</li>
          <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP): Document classification (e.g. movie review sentiment analysis), and language modelling</li>
          <li>Tabular data (e.g. sales prediction) with categorical data, continuous data, and mixed data, including time series</li>
          <li>Collaborative filtering (e.g. movie recommendation)</li>
        </ul>

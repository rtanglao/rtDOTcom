  <li><a href="http://21stcenturycam.com/prediction-by-31dec2016-there-will-be-an-awesome-ipad-pro-raw-editor">I was wrong about mobile RAW editors.</a> No standalone RAW editors on iOS (lightroom on iOS is close but no cigar since it has sync and AFAIK you canâ€™t just buy lightroom iOS and disable sync)</li>
  <li>Nothing emerged in 2016 that is stand-alone. I will make the same prediction that I made in 2016 but Iâ€™ll change 2016 to 2017 :-)

  <li>I think though that if you have iOS and <a href="https://cascable.se/">Cascable</a> and a camera like recent Olympus, Nikon and Canon cameras, Cascable + Lightroom on iOS = pretty darn close to what I predicted (it would be 100% if there was 90% feature parity with Lightroom desktop and you could just get a mobile Lightroom subscription)</li>

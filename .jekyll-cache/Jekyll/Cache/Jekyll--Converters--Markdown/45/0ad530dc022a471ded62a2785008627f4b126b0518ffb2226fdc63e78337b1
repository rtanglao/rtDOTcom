Bravo and many thanks! <strong>Credible Exit</strong> is an incredible phrase, we all need one right?â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Under these definitions, Bluesky and ATProto are not meaningfully decentralized, and are not federated either. However, this is not to say that Bluesky is not achieving something useful; while Bluesky is not building what is presently a decentralized Twâ…ˆtter, it is building an excellent replacement for Twâ…ˆtter, and Bluesky's main deliverable goal is something else instead: a Twâ…ˆtter replacement, with the possibility of "credible exit".</code></p>

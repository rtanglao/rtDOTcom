  <li>I am experiencing the issue where after Sonoma 14.4 my USB ports on my dock mysteriously stop working! i can make it work by following this workaround/USB ‚ÄúSpellcraft‚Äù :-) formerly known as USB v**doo (posting it here in case others can benefit):</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>unplug the USB-C cable from the Mac to the Thunderbolt dock</li>
  <li>power off the Thunderbird 4 dock</li>
  <li>power off my ultra wide monitor which has a built-in USB-A hub (the USB-A hub might be the culprit, should have üôÇ bought a more expensive monitor with a USB-C hub)</li>
  <li>power on the monitor</li>
  <li>power on the dock</li>
  <li>re-attach the USB-C cable from the dock to the Mac
    <ul>

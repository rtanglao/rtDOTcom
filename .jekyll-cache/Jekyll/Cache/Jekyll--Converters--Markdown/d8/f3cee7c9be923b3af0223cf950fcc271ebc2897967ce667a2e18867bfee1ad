<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>saw a post go by on the lua mailing list today, adding a new product to the user projects list... Adobe Lightroom, which just came out as a beta today. And I was flabbergasted by how it was described... '''Adobe Lightroom is &quot;the complete, elegant environment for the art and craft of digital photography from raw capture to creative output&quot;. <strong>Over 40% of Adobe Lightroom is written in Lua.</strong>''' (emphasis mine). </blockquote>

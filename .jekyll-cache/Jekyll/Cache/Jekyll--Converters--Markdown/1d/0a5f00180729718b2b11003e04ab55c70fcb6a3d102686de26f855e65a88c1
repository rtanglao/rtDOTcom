<p>From <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=720">Review: Samsung SPH-V4400 (MobileBurn)</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>While many companies have been releasing camera phones lately with 1 megapixel cameras and a short video recording time, Samsung has decided to go the whole way and introduce a tiny clamshell phone with a 2 megapixel camera and the ability to record over 2 hours of video. Concievably, you could record a full length motion picture if you wanted to. The SPH-V4400 also has a swivel screen, allowing you to turn the screen to make the phone look like a real camcorder since the lens is built in to the side of the phone, not the back or the flip. Samsung has also implemented an authentic style camcorder record button next to the camera lens, along with a photo light to shoot in dark situations.

Samsung is known for having some of the best screens on the market, and the V4400 is no exception. It features 262K color internal and external TFT screens, one of the first on the market to do so. Finally, the V4400 supports the new RS (Reduced Size) MMC cards which will allow you to store video clips and music files on the go.


Now for the bad news. The V4400 will only be available to users on a CDMA2000 1x EV-DO network, which rules most of us out. Still, this is a very interesting look at what Samsung has planned for future users.</blockquote>

I"N<p>It’s probably documented somewhere but it wasn’t obvious to me that R package names can’t have underscores or hyphens. And I couldn’t find an obvious error message about this when I tried to build the project. It just said that the DESCRIPTION file was not found or invalid but didn’t tell me it was the title field!</p>

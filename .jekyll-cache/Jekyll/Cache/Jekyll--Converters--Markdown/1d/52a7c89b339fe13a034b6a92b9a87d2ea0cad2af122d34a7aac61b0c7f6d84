Tired of these awesome but same old same old npr/cbc/bbc style ‚Äúshows‚Äù. &lt;‚Äì <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Throughout 2024, podcast creators asked us to think twice about our preconceptions: They followed stories that were supposed to be over, engaged with people who tend to get dismissed, and toyed with emerging technologies that make some people fear for humanity‚Äôs future. They explored city sewers, an historic baseball stadium, momentary fame, everyday household objects. This list represents the 20 best podcasts I heard this year, with a lean toward either new shows, or shows that have a renewed focus. Virtually all of them, even the most entertaining and quirky ones, suggested an underlying preoccupation with the power of narrative to shape our sense of reality.</code></p>

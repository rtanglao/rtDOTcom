<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>It's about attention, not platform. People don't say Hey, now I want to read a newspaper! Which one is it? --They want news and they go for the most immediate form--0ften web or cable TV. If you are an entertainment information brand, you are competing with brands you may never have considered--but they'll cut into the time your product used to get.</blockquote>

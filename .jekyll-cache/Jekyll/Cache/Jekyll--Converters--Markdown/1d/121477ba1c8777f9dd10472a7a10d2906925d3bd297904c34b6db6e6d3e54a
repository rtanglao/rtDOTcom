Me:: I don’t care about pixel quality. I often don’t notice teeny tiny pixel level details in software that make others go bonkers Terence Eden:: Most people don’t care about quality</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But, here's the thing, I don't think anyone other than a photographer would notice or care about those "problems". If you're a website designer, you're always noticing "jank" on other sites. Your skin crawls at the poor kerning, the FOUT, the lack of keyboard navigation, improper contrast ratio, and a dozen other flaws. 99% of users just don't care. It doesn't impact them in any meaningful way.</code></p>

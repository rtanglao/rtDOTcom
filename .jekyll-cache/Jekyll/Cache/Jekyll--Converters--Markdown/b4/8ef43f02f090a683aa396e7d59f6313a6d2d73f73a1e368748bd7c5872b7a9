Alissa M:  <a href="https://lissertations.net/post/1608">So whatâ€™s next?: five things I learned at #GOGLAM</a> â€œGood tech platforms can exist, if we care enough to build them. As it happened, GO GLAMâ€™s first speakers, a group of five mostly francophone and mostly Indigenous artists and coders from what is now eastern Canada, wound up doing almost exactly this. Natakanu, meaning â€˜visit each otherâ€™ in the Innu language, is an â€˜Indigenous-led, open source, peer to peer software projectâ€™, enabling First Nations communities to share art, data, files and stories without state surveillance, invasive tech platforms or an internet connection. I canâ€™t express how brilliant this project is. Iâ€™m still so deeply awed and impressed by what this team have built.â€</p>

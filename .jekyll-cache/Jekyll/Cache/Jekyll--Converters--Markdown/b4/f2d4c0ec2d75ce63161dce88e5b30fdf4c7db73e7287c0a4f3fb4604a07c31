    <p>Alicia Juarerro’s main points according to Chris Corrigan:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Nature uses constraints to generate emergence and sustain it. Constraints both limit and enable.</li>
      <li>Evolution selects for resilience, adaptability, and evolvability.</li>
      <li>Resilience is sustained by micro-diversity.</li>
      <li>Ecosystems are sustained by distributed control rather than governing control. The key is in the links.</li>
      <li>The emergence of novel practices – innovation – cannot be caused, but novelty can be enabled. You do this by catalyzing conditions that allow innovation to occur.</li>
      <li>Think of constraints as phenomena that change the likelihood of things, and the probabilities of what is going on.” &lt;– read the whole thing <a href="www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/constraints-that-enable-emergence/">Chris Corrigan: Constraints that enable emergence</a> and if you want more <a href="https://vimeo.com/128934608">Professor Juarerro’s 27 minute video</a> seems like a good place to start</li>

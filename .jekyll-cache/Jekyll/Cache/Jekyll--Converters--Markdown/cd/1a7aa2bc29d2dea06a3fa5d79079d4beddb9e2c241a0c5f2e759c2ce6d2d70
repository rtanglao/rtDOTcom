  <li>Somewhat :-) relevant previous post from 2017: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/10/05/p1-mel-robbins-buffering-add-buffer-to-everything/">Mel Robbins – buffering: top 3 things/day 50%  more time; every 15 minutes of meetings, 5mins to process; create space  between you and people who deplete you; make 1 decision that will help  future you; consider dropping those things you wouldn’t try to get  involved in if you weren’t already doing them</a></li>

      <li>agenda a day in advance, timebox w/priorities, have a chair / “person in charge of the meeting” , require politeness, no technology, no interruptions, record and publish minutes, everybody takes notes, keep a backlog, end early; interruption bingo for those (usually men !!!) who monopolize the discourse</li>

      <li>How to write a two-page memo making the case for doing something so that people have something concrete to debate (and so that there is a record later of why we did something).</li>
      <li>How to set priorities and re-set them when the world changes or people fall behind. (The real purpose of a schedule is to tell you when to start cutting things from your plan…)</li>

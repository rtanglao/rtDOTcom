I doubt that Blacksky will be under the â€œthumb of Blueskyâ€™s moderation serviceâ€ forever (if this is true, I donâ€™t know enough about ATProto to know for sure who is under the thumb of who) ; Bruno Dias,:: Delusions of a Protocol Â¦ Azhdarchid</a> &lt;â€“ <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">To my knowledge there's only one alternate stack that runs atproto as a complete service, Blacksky. But this isn't a turnkey solution that you can stand up as your own independent alternative; Blacksky at present barely has documentation. And even Blacksky users are still more or less under the thumb of Bluesky's moderation service, if they intend to reach 99% of the network as it exists today.</code></p>

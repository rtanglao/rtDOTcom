I"#<p>Come on people, pay up! Wow! That proves that Jason has a lot more readers than I thought and that people don't want to pay.  Weird.  Suggestion to Jason: sell t-shirts and other swag and provide subscriber only stuff like<a href="http://daringfireball.net/"> Daring Fireball</a> does.</p>

<blockquote><p>Looking at the numbers, less than 1/3 of a percent of my current average monthly unique visitors contributed to kottke.org...that's less than 1 in 300. I expected more than that, but I think it's difficult to "sell" media in an environment where people are increasingly not paying directly for media.</p></blockquote>

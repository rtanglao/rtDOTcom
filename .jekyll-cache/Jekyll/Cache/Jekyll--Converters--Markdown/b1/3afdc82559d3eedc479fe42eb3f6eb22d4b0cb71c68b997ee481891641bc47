I"®<p>Excellent summary from Julie! Read <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/archives/001980.html">the whole thing</a>! I want to run my own Foo Camp (so many ideas so little time!)! There would be some sessions  like a "Web 2.0 Remix Fest" where people come together and do a cool hack using Web 2.0 APIs and interfaces  (e.g. <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/08/27/autogenerated_1_minute_movies_from_interesting_flickr_pictures">my 1 minute Flickr movie remix hack</a>).</p>

Much better than using videos to learn because you have relevant timecodes and can follow along and go backwards and forwards!  &lt;– QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So let’s pull this together. What I want is a tool that:...1. Records my interactions with my desktop as a stream of logical events rather than as video....2. Simultaneously, records what I’m saying....3. Allows me to edit the combination in the way that Camtasia or OBS lets me edit screencasts....4. Lets a learner replay the result in a sandbox VM on their computer or in the cloud....5. Lets the learner stop the replay at any point and fork a new VM to play around in.... 6.  When she’s done, lets her throw away that VM and resume the lesson where she left off.</code></li>

I"<p>I foolishly upgraded to Tiger 2 weeks and ago and have had to endure the h*ll of my audio software (<a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/">WireTap Pro</a>) not working for a couple of weeks. The new version of WireTap Pro (1.1.0) that just came out a couple of days ago works with <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/freebies/">LineIn</a> and my microphones and mixer but doesn't seem to work if you use the new Play Through feature. Still digging, hope the play through feature works better in post 1.1.0 releases!</p>

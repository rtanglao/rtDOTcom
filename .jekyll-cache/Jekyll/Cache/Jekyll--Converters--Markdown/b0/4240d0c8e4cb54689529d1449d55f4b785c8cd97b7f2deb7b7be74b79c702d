In fact, compared with competitors, the NLT approach minimizes the total cumulative cost (development and evolution) and does not require software testers with programming skills. NLT is also the best in terms of resiliency being more robust to the evolution of a web application. CRT is slightly faster during development but then loses when evolution is considered. In conclusion, these new NLP-based tools appear to be very promising and will probably be even more performing in the near future when the adopted NLP algorithms used to transform natural language based test cases into executable test cases improve further.</code></p>

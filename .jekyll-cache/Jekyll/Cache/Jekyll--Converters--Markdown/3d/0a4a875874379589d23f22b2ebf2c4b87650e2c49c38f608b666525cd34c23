I"æ<p>I am (almost over my jet lag) and grooving on the awesome European developer energy (just as much energy if not more as in Canada and the USA) here at <a href="http://drupal.org/conference-amsterdam-2005">Drupal Con AMS 2005</a>. Check out <a href="http://bryght.com/blog/roland-tanglao">my Bryght blog</a> for my attempts at blogging the sessions I attend and check out the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/drupalcon/">DrupalCon flickr photos</a> taken by me and others.</p>

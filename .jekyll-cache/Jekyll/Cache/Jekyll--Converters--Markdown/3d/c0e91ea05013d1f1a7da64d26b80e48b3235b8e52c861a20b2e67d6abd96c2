I nominate <a href="http://honours.wordpress.com/">Debbie</a> (check out <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/node/3641">my cheesy video with Debbie</a> which shows her potential. I am sure it would be trivial to kick it up a notch and produce a killer demo reel) and <a href="http://sarahpullman.com/">Sarah</a> (check out <a href="http://sarahpullman.com/blog/sarahfelicity/getv-appearance">her awesome work at Geek Entertainment television</a>)  to co-anchor. </p>

I"à<p>Finally starting to get better! First in my series of reflections on <a href="http://northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a>. Is <a href="http://dijest.com/">Phil Wolff</a> everywhere or what? And that's not a gripe, it's a good thing. Phil is a smart guy and really should be everywhere! Why do I think that Phil and I will work together in the future? Or is it that everybody will work with Phil in the future :-) ! Anyways Phil, I am sure somewhere, somehow one of your clients will need a <a href="http://bryght.com/">Bryght</a> site. You know where to find me when that time comes!</p>

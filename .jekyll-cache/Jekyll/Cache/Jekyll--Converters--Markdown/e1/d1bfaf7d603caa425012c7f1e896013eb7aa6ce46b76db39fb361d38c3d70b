<blockquote>
  <p>I’m going to define “technical” skills and then make the case that they’re everywhere and severely underrated. Handwaving over them allows us to dismiss the work of wide swaths of the population. And noticing them will light up your life and unlock new worlds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point is: sewing is very technical.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And we can ONLY write sewing off as “just arts and crafts” and unimpressive compared to the Maker movement if we choose to ignore that sewing is very technical.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Likewise, we can ONLY write off marketing, sales, management, design, product, HR, etc etc etc etc as less important because “they’re not technical” if we choose to ignore that they are very technical.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This distinction isn’t just about semantics. It’s also about value.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Erasing technical skills lets you erase value.</p>

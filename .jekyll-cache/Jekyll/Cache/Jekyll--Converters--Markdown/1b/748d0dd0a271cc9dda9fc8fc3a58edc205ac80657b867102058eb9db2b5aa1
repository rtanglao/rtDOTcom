I"¨<p>As <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/categories/webcms/2003/05/21.html#a4386">I have been saying since at least 2003</a>, eventually everybody (not just media figures like news anchors!) will have a blog like everybody has email today (if they want it!).
</p>
<p>From <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20050419/tv_nm/media_nbc_news_dc"><p>Yahoo! News - NBC Chief Mulls Blogs for Top News Anchors&lt;/a&gt;.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p><blockquote>NBC could create Internet blogs for its top news anchors and celebrity interviewers as it seeks to maintain the appeal of U.S. network news, its top executive said on Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;
<p>NBC Universal Television Group President Jeff Zucker said entering the generally opinionated world of blogs might be one way television networks could keep their grip on viewers who increasingly use the Internet for news.</p> </blockquote><p><b>UNQUOTE</b></p>

<br /><span class="jotsBookmarkDescription">the usual uninformed article from the canadian press about blogs, yes they can be boring self-indulgent p*rn etc. but so can mainstreet media; it's not the fact that they are journals or that lots of them are &quot;bad&quot; it's that anybody can publish to 1, 10, 1000, or millions and be connected through real time search to have meaningful conversation and interactions; it's the 2 way web ! a 2 way printing press for everybody, individuals, academia, non profits and business. that's the power! why is that so difficult for the canadian press to understand?</span>

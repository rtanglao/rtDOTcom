<p><b>QUOTE from <a href="http://booktwo.org/notebook/stop-lying/">http://booktwo.org/notebook/stop-lying/</a> </b></p>
<blockquote>
I go through cycles of belief about the future of writing, of publishing, of the written word. But too much is broken to continue to pretend that the models we have become used to, the models of sales and distribution, of composition and recompense, of form and style, of reading and attention, can stagger on much longer.

This is the world we are living in and we can either lie to ourselves about it or we can dive headlong into the new forms and effects that it produces.

<ul>
  <li>I would love to have comments.</li>
  <li>But I donâ€™t trust comment services like disqus not to go evil and not to go out of business.</li>
  <li>And I donâ€™t like waiting for comment services to render. Love the fast rendering of this website!</li>
  <li>Finally I donâ€™t trust client side comment services which are prone to spam.</li>
</ul>

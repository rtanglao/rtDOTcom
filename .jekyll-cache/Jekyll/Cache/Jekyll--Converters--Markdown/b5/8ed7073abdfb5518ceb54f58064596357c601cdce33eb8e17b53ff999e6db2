I"&<p>tl;dr Please <a href="https://cypresschallenge.ca/fundraiser/roland">donate</a> to my ride up Cypress Mountain on July 27, 2025, the <a href="http://cypresschallenge.com">Cypress Challenge. 100% goes to Pancreatic Research.</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>On the occasion of my birthday on July 11, 2025 I’d like you to consider donating to the Cypress Challenge in honour of my mother Sofia who died of pancreatic cancer in 2013 less than week after being diagnosed. It’s a zero overhead ride so all money goes to Pancreatic Cancer research. We all have limited charity budgets and we’re still living in a pandemic until we get a <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9595357/">sterilizing vaccine</a> so if donation isn’t possible, please send healing and innovation vibes to the incredible pancreatic researchers at BC Cancer (and of course I’d love some good bicycling karma for the 12km ascent to Cypress!).</li>

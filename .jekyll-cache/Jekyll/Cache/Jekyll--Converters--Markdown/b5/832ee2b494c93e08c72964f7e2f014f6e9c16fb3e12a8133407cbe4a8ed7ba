My guess is that we believe in the power of struggle because  itâ€™s how many of us learned computing. We struggled to figure out  undocumented systems, to make things work, and to figure out why they  worked. We come away with a rationalization that the process of  discovery, without a teacher or guidance, is what led to our learning.  The problem is that for experts and high-ability/highly-motivated  learners, we like to learn that way. We want to figure it out for  ourselves. There is a motivational (affective) value for discovery.  However, the available evidence suggests that our belief in discovery is a mirage, a cognitive illusion, a trick we play on ourselves. We donâ€™t  learn best by discovery.â€</li>

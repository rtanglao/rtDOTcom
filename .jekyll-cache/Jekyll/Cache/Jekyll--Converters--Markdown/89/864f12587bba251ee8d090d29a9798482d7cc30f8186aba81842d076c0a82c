I"%<p>The Canadian mobile oligopoly of Telus, Rogers and Bell will not innovate or produce anything in the mobile space that's innovative and hasn't been pioneered elsewhere (and they will <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/12/21/canada-will-get-mobile-number-portability-in-march-2007-too-little-too-late-from-the-crtc">kicking and screaming start to implement mobile number portability</a>). They will also not introduce affordable (to the power users and geeks even) <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/12/13/wireless-data-in-canada-is-ridiculously-expensive-boris-is-right">3G and GPRS will still be a r*poff in Canada</a>. TV phones will be a failure. But it's not all gloom and doom. Luckily cool mobile stuff will abound elsewhere in the world that the oligopoly can copy and we will start to see <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/12/23/mobile-voice-over-wifi-rolands-2006-predictions-part-1">phones like the N91 that hopefully (fingers crossed) allow us to start routing around the Canadian mobile oligopoly</a>.</p>

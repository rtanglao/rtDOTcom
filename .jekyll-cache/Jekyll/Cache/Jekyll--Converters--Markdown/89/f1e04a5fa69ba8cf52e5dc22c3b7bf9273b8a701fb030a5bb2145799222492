Many such people later need to do statistics, and this will give them quick access. It is modeled after my R tutorial, https://github.com/matloff/fasteR, a quick introduction to R....It is not just a quick introduction, but a REAL one, a practical one. Even those who do already know statistics will find that they learn from this tutorial.</code></p>

I"”<p>Even though Safari is slower than Firefox, it remains my default browser because:</p>
<ul><li> I can post to my blog from any app from <a href="http://www.kung-foo.tv/ecto/">ecto</a>   using Command @.  This doesn't work with Firefox.
</li><li>Tabs work properly i.e. multiple tabs get opened when I click on NetNewsWire rather than multiple windows.  Again this doesn't work with Firefox.</li></ul>

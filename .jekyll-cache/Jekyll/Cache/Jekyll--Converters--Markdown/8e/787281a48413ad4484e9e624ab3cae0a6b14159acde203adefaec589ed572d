  <li>jscher’s amazing <a href="https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ext/printable.html">Printable Extension for Firefox</a> (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/printable-the-print-doctor/">AMO Listing</a>) &lt;– “Printable was created to address my own frustrations, but judging by  the growing number of users, other people are finding it useful as well.” &lt;– It fixes or at least tries to fix  <code class="highlighter-rouge">display: flex</code>, custom fonts, fixed position elements and more</li>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

    "Letting excessive negativity dominate your mindset and communication and spilling over into toxicity is dangerous to productive teams and expensive for businesses. I can’t tell you the number of software projects that I have seen (and heard of) get torn down and completely rebuilt at great cost because one trusted software developer had an axe to grind with a technology, a former developer, or a single file they took to be representative of the quality of the entire codebase. It’s also demoralizing and strains relationships. I’ll never forget an incident where I was berated by a coworker for putting CSS in the wrong file, which upset me and distracted my thoughts for days. I’m also very unlikely to ever let that person near one of my teams in the future. (But who knows? People change.)"<br /> <br />
    It’s also literally bad for your health.

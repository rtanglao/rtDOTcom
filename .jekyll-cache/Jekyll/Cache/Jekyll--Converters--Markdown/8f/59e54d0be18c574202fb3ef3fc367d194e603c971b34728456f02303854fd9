<p>BEGIN QUOTE:</p>

<p>‚Äù‚Äú<strong>However, we must get there through collective empowerment and strong social  programs like universal basic income, universal healthcare, divestment  from warfare and policing, a regulated real estate market that does not  capitalize on housing scarcity and rent, worker unions, food programs,  environmental protections, and actual, functioning income taxes on the  wealthy.</strong> An individualist fantasy of a pyramid scheme, made to  reward investors over artists and directly thieving from our shared  future just isn‚Äôt it.</p>

<p>Many would call me unrealistic and na√Øve for this, unwilling to make  compromises in the world we are living now because of an idealistic  vision of a tomorrow; and to them I would like to say that we literally  invented an extra-sovereign monetary system that within 10 years has  generated trillions of dollars of worth and is held up with the power  consumption of a small country.</p>

<p>Let this whole horrible chapter of history convince you that money is fake, we can do anything with it we want, and that we do not want cryptoart.‚Äù</p>

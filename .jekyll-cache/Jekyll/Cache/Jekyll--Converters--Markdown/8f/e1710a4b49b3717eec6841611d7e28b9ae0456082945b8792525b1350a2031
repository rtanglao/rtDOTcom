  <li>Glad to see <a href="https://anchor.fm/">anchor.fm</a> survived a year! (I tried anchor when it first launched on iOS a year ago! Didnâ€™t think theyâ€™d survive honestly but glad they did!)</li>
  <li>Love the improvements. Much easier and much funnier and much easier to share? Try it!</li>
  <li>And non-obviously (user experience needs fixing for this!) there are permanent links: Tap on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Share</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Share just this segment</code> to share a permanent link to Twitter (only works in the mobile app, doesnâ€™t work on the desktop version!)</li>
  <li>Sample permanent link: <a href="https://twitter.com/rtanglao/status/875240294345723904">Roland Springsteen :-) goes to Vegas</a></li>
  <li>For a not-so-good time LOL, listen to my station <a href="https://anchor.fm/roland">anchor.fm/roland</a> :-)</li>

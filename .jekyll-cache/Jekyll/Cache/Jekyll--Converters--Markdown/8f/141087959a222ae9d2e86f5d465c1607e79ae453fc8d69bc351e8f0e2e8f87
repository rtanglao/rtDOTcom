Read the whole thing â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The idea of these things being sentient is a science fiction fantasy. But listen to the people whoâ€™ve brought this into the world, sincerely believing it to be some kind of new sentience, and saying â€œif it crosses a line we made up, we should kill it and everything like itâ€. Even if theyâ€™re right, how could you trust somebody like that with a houseplant, much less an important idea, much less public policy? ... Theyâ€™re not right, though, and theyâ€™re not really scared; they just need you to be. So they can avoid being held to account, so we donâ€™t talk about the real locus of agency in software, and where responsibility for real-world harms should actually reside. To distract us from a more fundamental question, of whether or not software developers should be held accountable, in detail, for the real social and economic failures caused by the software weâ€™ve created.</code></p>

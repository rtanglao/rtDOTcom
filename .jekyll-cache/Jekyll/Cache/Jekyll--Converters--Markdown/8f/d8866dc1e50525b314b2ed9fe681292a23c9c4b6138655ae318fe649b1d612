Must...get.... more... sleep! Thanks Liz for pointing this out. "Founders" would be much better than "Founding Fathers".</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2005/05/open_media_lumi.html">misbehaving.net: open media luminaries: mothers need not apply</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently Always On and Technorati are combining forces to determine the "OpenMedia 100," a group of movers and shakers who'll be voted on using Technorati tags and then published in the AlwaysOn Blogozine.
</p>
<p>The first category?
</p>
    <blockquote>Founding Fathers: Industry luminaries who created the vision of open media and continue to shape it.</blockquote>

&lt;sigh&gt;

<p>No founding mothers could even be imagined, apparently. Meg Hourihan, Caterina Fake, Mena Trott, Esther Dyson, Xeni Jardin...guess y'all are all just one of the guys.
</p>
<p>I don't know why this kind of cultural boneheadedness continues to surprise and depress me, but it does.</p>

Aargh! There doesn't appear to be a Nokia Wireless Keyboard (SU-8W) driver (why is a driver required in the first place?) for the N91. I tried to install the driver for the N90 (which is also a Series 60 v3 device so it should work, right?) on the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,67023,00.html">Nokia SU-8W software page</a> but it doesn't work ('Installation of Nokia_SU8W_BTKeyboard_1_17.SIS not supported'). This is a show stopper for me using the N91 as my one and only mobile device. If anybody can point me to an SU-8W driver I would be very grateful (I'll buy you a beer the next time you are in Vancouver!). I am, of course, willing, to try a beta SU-8W driver.

Iâ€™m perfectly comfortÂ­able in the both/and. IÂ accept the inviÂ­taÂ­tion of the slab; IÂ benefit daily from the leverage it grants me. IÂ am, at the same time, certain my functions and notebooks will be blown away before the decade is out; maybe just by the leviathanâ€™s restlessness, or maybe by something moreÂ dire....Iâ€™d like a permaÂ­comÂ­puter of myÂ own.</code></p>

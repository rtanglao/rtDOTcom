  <li>I fixed the <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/mQzpXYDmRxE">â€œunlocked vanilla Pixel XL running Fido â€œcorruptedâ€ firmware :-) stuck at Feb 2017â€</a> bug by manually flashing April 2017 using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6x7k-VkpUJMlZ1aEliVnhMOHM/view">Techno :-) LOL Billâ€™s fab rescue OTA instructions</a></li>
  <li>I hope I donâ€™t have to do this every month. Itâ€™s painful but definitely doable. And not what Google advertises for the Pixel especially a Pixel that has vanilla Android and wasnâ€™t bought with a carrier ROM. Updates are supposed to occur monthly from Google unimpeded by carrier craziness!</li>

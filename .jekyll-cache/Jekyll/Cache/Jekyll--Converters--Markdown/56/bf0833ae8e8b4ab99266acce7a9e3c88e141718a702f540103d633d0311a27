I"'<p>[Disclaimer: I am a friend of <a href="http://kinzin.com/">Kinzin</a> honcho <a href="http://fergusson.net/">Michael Fergusson</a> and Kinzin social media marketer <a href="http://www.megancole.org/">Megan Cole</a>]</p>
<p>I love Kinzin&#39;s aka &quot;<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/thesearemykids">These are my Kids</a>&quot;&#39;s new (well not so new my blog post is late!) &quot;Print Pack&quot; feature. This feature allows you to ship 10 prints for $US 2.50 plus shipping anywhere in the world!</p>
<p>I use it to send 10 photos per month to my family in Belgium and Ontario and also to us. Great idea (which I and probably others suggested to them!)</p>
<p>Digital photos are great but having hard copies is also great. And finally through the Print Pack Feature I have an easy way to do it from flickr (or from your local drive or facebook but I don&#39;t store my photos on local drives or facebook).</p>
<p>Feature Request: do the same thing for videos i.e. how about a DVD from my flickr videos shipped once a month for say $5 / month plus shipping?</p>
<p>Feedback on These are my kids:</p>
<ol>   <li>Could we please have it as an independent website? There&#39;s no value for me having it as a facebook app (but I can see why it is a facebook app; the community is there, still I&#39;d rather use it using my kinzin login rather than my facebook login)</li>    <li>The default privacy settings are to make everything visible in your Facebook feed. I&#39;d prefer the default to be that everything is NOT visible but I concede I am over zealous about the privacy of our child.</li>    <li>Adding a photo to my print pack is not intuitive. You can&#39;t add all 10 at once, why not? Also I would prefer to have to be able to add photos via a tag e.g. kinzinprintjuly08 to my print pack.</li> </ol>

<p>Just for fun, I will do a dataset, “roland-cars” around electric cars in Canada:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exclude sports cars like Tesla and has to be “affordable”</li>
  <li>include all safety features</li>
  <li>exclude paying extra for Android and Apple Car</li>
  <li>60 month lease price</li>
  <li>48 month lease price</li>
  <li>plug in hybrids</li>
  <li>range</li>
  <li>pure electric as well as PHEV</li>
  <li>have to be able to go to Cypress (80km round trip, 1000metre elevation rise in  sub zero temperatures twice a week for 5 months of year)</li>
  <li>would be nice if it can make it to Whistler Olympic Park which is 130km one way, so 260km round trip</li>
  <li>factor in the $2500 BC rebate for PHEV and $5000 BC rebate for EV</li>
</ul>

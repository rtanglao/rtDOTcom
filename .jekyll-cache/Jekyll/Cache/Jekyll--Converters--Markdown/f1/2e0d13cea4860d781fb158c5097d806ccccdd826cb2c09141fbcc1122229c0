Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry have built a ventilation system that can be replicated using materials from a DIY store. A comprehensive school in Mainz has already tested the system. The Rhineland-Palatinate Ministry of Education is currently testing use of the system in other schools. A construction report is available online.</code> &lt;â€“ we have the technology ; we just donâ€™t have the will to deploy it! Just like global climate change!</p>

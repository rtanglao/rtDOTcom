I"ä<p>My trial N70 (thanks Andy and Nokia!) hangs seemingly randomly. I haven't reported it yet because I have been trying to figure out how to reproduce it reliably.  Here's the sequence of events:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a few photos or videos
</li>
<li>Launch ShoZu and try to select a few photos or videos to upload.
</li>
<li>Up and down cursor keys don't work, rest of the phone seems to work (i.e. making calls, other apps)</li></ol>

<p>If I then reboot the phone, Shozu, the phone and the cursor keys work fine.

<blockquote>Doc quotes Paul Boutin as saying:

<p>Nokia would never ship a phone with a spinning color wheel of death.
</p>
<p>I wish they had because then at least I would have something to stare at when my new n70 hangs which it does on a wearyingly regular basis!

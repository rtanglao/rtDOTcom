<blockquote>
  <p>It all goes down to including what is relevant to give the user an accurate idea of your artwork:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>the medium you used to make the artwork (is it a digital illustration? a traditional oil painting? a graphite pencil sketchbook doodle?)</li>
    <li>the subject of the artwork</li>
    <li>anything that is relevant for understanding the meaning of the artwork. For instance, is the lighting important, or does it bring a particular meaning or mood?</li>
    <li>Write sentences - don’t just throw away key words. EDIT: don’t write full sentences, but phrases and fragments to keep your description concise</li>
    <li>adding one more thing after getting feedback: keep it concise! Under 125 characters (even 100 is best)</li>
  </ul>

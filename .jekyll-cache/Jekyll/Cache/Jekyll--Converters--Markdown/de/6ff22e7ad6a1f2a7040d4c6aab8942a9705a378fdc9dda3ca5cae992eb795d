Following quote is amazing though :-) –&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: ` Our preregistered analysis shows that algorithmic deamplification reduced engagement with misinformation websites by over half, while informative interventions had statistically insignificant effects on engagement. These results suggest that research and platform priorities should shift away from informative interventions—which have been the overwhelming focus for the past eight years [4, 5]—and toward algorithmic interventions, which are comparatively understudied. We further conclude that co-designed studies with platforms are vital to improving scientific understanding of how platform algorithms and design affect society.`</p>

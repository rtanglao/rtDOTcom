I"®<p> Another howler from the Globe and Mail (please hire more technology writers like <a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/">Matthew Ingram </a>who are clued in and listening rather than people like the author of this article).  </p>
<p> The prognostication that &quot;Web 2.0 companies cost too much to be profitable in Canada&quot; will turn out to be just as laughable as the <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=141">1990s predictions of Apple&#39;s demise</a>. The whole point of Web 2.0 (the read write web or whatever you want to call it) especially with affordable infrastructure like Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a> is that anybody with a great idea and great implementation skills can build a web service anywhere in the world (not just in Silicon Valley) that is useful and scalable. Not convinced? Some Canadian examples: flickr (which was reportedly profitable before being acquired by Yahoo), <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">dabble db</a>, <a href="http://www.bubbleshare.com/">bubbleshare</a> just to name a few. </p>

<blockquote> &quot;You&#39;ll notice that there are no Web 2.0 companies on the list -- they just cost too much to be profitable in this country,&quot; Mr. Behr said. &quot;We&#39;re not looking for something you&#39;ll see on the Internet, instead we&#39;re looking for applications that make what you see work better.&quot; </blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Went to the <a href="http://www.ecuad.ca/calendar/save-the-date-join-us-for-our-open-house-events-october-27-28">Emily Carr Big Reveal</a> today.</li>
  <li>Very gothic, very centralized and very fab but it felt very cathedral-ish to me in the best possible way and in all the negative ways too.</li>
  <li>Which begs these questions to me anyways :-):
    <ul>
      <li>Why can‚Äôt universities be more integrated into the community and decentralized like public libraries?
        <ul>
          <li>The libraries have a central branch but then they also have very effective and useful branches in every community.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why not have the 21st century equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quonset_hut">quonset huts</a> in every community, move them around, and/or make them fixed sites with varying stuff and people and students? i.e. mini distributed university ‚Äúincubators‚Äù everywhere. e.g. a hut with  solar cells, power and connectivity that people get scholarships to work at, do art, do science, teach in small tutorial groups, do workshops, etc?</li>
    </ul>

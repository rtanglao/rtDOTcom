I"v<p>I hope <a href="http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/">Mitch</a> is wrong, but his arguments against a public Google being nearly as innovative are persuasive.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://blog.redherring.com/MT/archives/main/000188.html">Red Herring Blog: Why I wonâ€™t be a Google IPO investor</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>The technology world is waiting with bated breath for Google to announce its initial public offering. I'd love to own Google &#8211; the Google of today &#8211; a private company free to do almost anything its owners want without having to worry about how the equity markets will respond to it. I wouldn't buy Google shares at an IPO, because they will be priced for a perfection imposed by those same owners who enjoy the benefits of operating Google today as a wildly profitable private company.</blockquote>

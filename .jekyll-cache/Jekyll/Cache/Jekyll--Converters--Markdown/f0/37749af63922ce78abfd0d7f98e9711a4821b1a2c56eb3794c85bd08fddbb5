I"Ñ<p>YES! Drupal running on S60 mobile phones! Have to try this, guess I&#39;ll have to get a S60 device with as much RAM as an E90!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=102803"><cite>PHP running on Mobile Web Server - Developer Discussion Boards</cite></a>:  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   PAMP stands for Personal Apache, MySQL, PHP, so yes, the full LAMP stack will be made available for S60 smart phones. In addition, there will be PHP extension modules that provide access to the core functionality of the phone. And on top of PAMP you can basically install any LAMP based content management system. For instance, Drupal can be installed off the shelf. Yes, a fair amount of memory is needed and it's still pretty experimental stuff, but it runs quite nicely on E90. So, if you are in the neighbourhood, join us in Las Vegas Johan &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

  <li>As per my previous post, <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2022/08/27/p1-free-hosting-private-companies-heroku-slack-does-not-work-bring-on-the-un-black-helicopters-aka-free-government-hosting/">Free  hosting from for profit companies like Heroku, Slack etc doesn’t work.  Don’t depend on it! Only viable long term solution is for the UN Black  Helicopters :-) i.e. the government needs to offer hosting</a>, I don’t really trust “the Cloud” especially “free” cloud sesrvices.</li>
  <li>I have 3 laptops and 2 Raspberry Pis: one or more of them is always online, couldn’t I use them as my own CDN to serve a static website?</li>
  <li>The whole notion of clients and servers is silly in 2022.</li>

      <li>Check out my N70 running the <a href="http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/mobile-web-server/index.html">Nokia open source port of Apache</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=167580">Raccoon</a> at: 
http://roland.tanglao.guest.at.openlaboratory.net/ &lt;– too bad nothing came of it,  all computers are servers and clients in 2022 it seems to me! If a Nokia phone could run a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server</code> in 2022 than my laptops and Pis can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">servers</code> in 2022!!!!!!!!</li>

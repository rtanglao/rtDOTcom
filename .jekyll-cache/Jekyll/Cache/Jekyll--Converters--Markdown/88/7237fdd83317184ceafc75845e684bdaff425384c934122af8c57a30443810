I";<p>This makes perfect sense to me.  I say go for it Google!  Can a Google hegemony be any worse than the current Microsoft one?</p>

<p>From<a href="http://www.kottke.org/04/04/google-operating-system">GooOS, the Google Operating System (kottke.org)</a>:</p>
<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>Google isn't worried about Yahoo! or Microsoft's search efforts...although the media's focus on that is probably to their advantage. Their real target is Windows. Who needs Windows when anyone can have free unlimited access to the world's fastest computer running the smartest operating system? Mobile devices don't need big, bloated OSes...they'll be perfect platforms for accessing the GooOS. Using Gnome and Linux as a starting point, Google should design an OS for desktop computers that's modified to use the GooOS and sell it right alongside Windows ($200) at CompUSA for $10/apiece (available free online of course). Google Office (Goffice?) will be built in, with all your data stored locally, backed up remotely, and available to whomever it needs to be (SubEthaEdit-style collaboration on Word/Excel/PowerPoint-esque documents is only the beginning). Email, shopping, games, music, news, personal publishing, etc.; all the stuff that people use their computers for, it's all there.</blockquote>

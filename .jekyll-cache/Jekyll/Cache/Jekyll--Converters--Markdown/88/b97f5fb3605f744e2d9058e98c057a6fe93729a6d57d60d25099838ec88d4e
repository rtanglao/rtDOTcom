<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote>When we started on Flickr weren't sure exactly what we were building, just that we had the core of something really interesting.

Since we've had the preview release out over the last few months, we've received a ton of feedback, watched how people were using (and not using) various features and generally learned a lot. Now we have a clear idea of what we're building: the best way to store, search, sort and share your photos online.</blockquote>

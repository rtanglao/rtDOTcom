  <p>We argue here that people’s limited knowledge and their misleading intuitive epistemology combine to create 
an illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). Most people feel they understand the world with far greater detail, coherence,
and depth than they really do. The illusion for explanatory knowledge–knowledge that involves complex causal patterns—is separate from, and
additive with, people’s general overconfidence about their knowledge and skills. We therefore propose that knowledge of complex causal relations is
particularly susceptible to illusions of understanding.</p>

  <li>If I have something to sell, then Iâ€™ll start an email list but until then Iâ€™ll happily blog aimlessly like itâ€™s 2002, and I still donâ€™t care about Medium (but hey maybe Iâ€™ll write a script to post links to Medium!?!? LOL :-))</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s more important to have something cool to sell than to worry about Medium versus blogging; do both if you actually have something cool to sell for real $</li>

Thatâ€™s not something youâ€™ll see after six weeks of blogging on Wordpress.<br />

Okay. Letâ€™s talk about how to use Medium and ConvertKit together.<br />

Use Upscribe, integrated with ConvertKit, to make a pretty little form to add to your Medium posts, and youâ€™ll start building the only thing that really matters today when it comes to blogging: an email list.<br />

Host that lovely list on ConvertKit and youâ€™ll never be sorry. You can set up a drip course, automate your list to tag your followers in a thousand different ways, and easily send out broadcasts to just the people you want to reach.<br />

Once you have a nice little following, and maybe you have some income coming in, then head over to Bluehost and get that self-hosted Wordpress blog. Repost your Medium work over there. Write fresh stuff and cross-post it to Medium. Send your email list there when you have something new to show them.<br />

But you donâ€™t have to.<br />

If you only have a little money to spend your new online enterprise, spend it on the best email server you can.<br />

And if you have plenty of money? Start a blog. But still use ConvertKit and Mediumâ€Šâ€”â€Šgo back and look at my screenshots if you need a reminder of why.<br />

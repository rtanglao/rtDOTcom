  <li>Vancouver has lost one of its most compelling creators: <a href="https://darrenbarefoot.com/">Darren Barefoot</a>. See his last blog post: <a href="https://darrenbarefoot.com/2023/02/25/they-were-all-splendid/">They were all splendid</a></li>
  <li>We in the tech community in Vancouver, Ireland, and beyond were lucky to have intersected with Darren and his life and work.</li>
  <li>I was privileged enough to have hung out with DB (and fabulous partner Julie) at the Northern Voice blogging conference and to be a co-organizer and attend so many NV meetings with him. So many great memories, so many great DB blog posts and words. e.g. May 2, 2016: <a href="https://capulet.com/2016/05/02/2016-5-2-why-marketers-need-to-become-inventors/">Why marketers need to become inventors</a>
    <ul>
      <li>â€œI like to think my friend Roland <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2004/07/31/anil-its-not-about-seo-its-about-creating-compelling-content-constantly/">invented content strategy</a> in the early 2000â€™s when he described his Four Câ€™s: create compelling content constantly. Content strategy has, of course, been added to our long list of online marketing activitiesâ€Šâ€”â€Šmedia relations, SEO, email marketing, social media and so forthâ€Šâ€”â€Šthat everyone does. We have to do these things just to keep up with our competitors. I call these ongoing daily marketing activities â€œheartbeats,â€ because theyâ€™re constant, reliable and they keep an organizationâ€™s outreach alive.â€</li>

  <li>Thanks DB. I miss you!</li>

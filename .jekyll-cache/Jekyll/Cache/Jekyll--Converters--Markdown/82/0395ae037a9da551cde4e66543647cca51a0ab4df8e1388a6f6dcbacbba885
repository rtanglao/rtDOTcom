Do observing and action in the manner of so-called ‚Äúgreatness‚Äù justify anything ? &lt;‚Äì <strong>ANOTHER QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The classical historian did not think in terms of ‚Äúhistorical processes‚Äù but in terms deeds‚Äîgreat deeds, the sort of deeds that brought glory or shame to the doer simply by being done.5 Perhaps you see the connection between this conception of history and the lengthy epigraph at the topic of this post. Each Greek polis was united by a common set of moral ideals. These were often taught formally, but the most important education came from observation, not instruction. The distribution of power and honor within a polis was itself an education in character. By observing who was allowed power and honor, and how the powerful and honored comported themselves in the affairs of their city, the youth of each polis learned what it meant to be a good man and live a good life in their community.6 Thus the structure of rank and honor (pol√≠teuma ) and the moral formation of the citizen (paƒ±de√≠a) were one and the same.</code></p>

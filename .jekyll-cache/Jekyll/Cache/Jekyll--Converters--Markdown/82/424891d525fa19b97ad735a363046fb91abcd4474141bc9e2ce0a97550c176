<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúNEWTRO‚Äù by Kotaro Kumazawa - this one is my go to for everyday-shoot and portraits. The color profile is close to what my eyes see, with lifted blacks. I set the opacity at around 60-70%.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúWarm Film‚Äù by EJAY - though meant for VLOG, I use this one quite a lot when shooting well-lit environments with a lot of whites in the scene. It warms the scene up in a harmonious way. I also like the way it expresses skin tone. Again, play around with the opacity. I usually stack it on top of a Rec709 LUT set to 10% opacity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúTeal Flat-S‚Äù by LUMIX - kind of a fun one. I usually use it at night. It makes the yellows really pop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúLeica Monochrome‚Äù - my go-to for black and white!</p>

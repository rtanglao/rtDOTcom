  <li>It is definitely worth your while to read all 9 essays linked to in yesterday’s  post: <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2021/05/15/p1-crooked-timber-seminar-for-the-future/">Cory Doctorow: Crooked Timber’s Ministry for the Future Seminar &lt;– must read essays on climate change</a></li>
  <li>But if you don’t have time at the moment, starting with <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2021/05/14/response-7/">Kim Stanley Robinson’s Response to the Ministry for the Future Semina</a>r and then reading the 9 linked essays also works :-)</li>
</ul>

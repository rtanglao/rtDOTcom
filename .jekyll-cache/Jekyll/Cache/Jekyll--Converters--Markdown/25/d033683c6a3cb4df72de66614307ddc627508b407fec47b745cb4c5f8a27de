Lets you execute search and replace patterns that look a little bit like simplified regular expressions, but with some deep OCaml-powered magic that makes them aware of comment, string and nested parenthesis rules for different languages. This means you can use it to construct scripts that automate common refactoring or code upgrade tasks. </code> &lt;â€“ I will probably nee use this but it sounds great!</p>

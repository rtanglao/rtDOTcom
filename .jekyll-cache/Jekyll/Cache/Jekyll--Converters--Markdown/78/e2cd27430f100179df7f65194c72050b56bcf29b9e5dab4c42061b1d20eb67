  <li>‚ÄúWhile none of the counter-MRS ideas have been tested empirically yet,  Allen says one trick with promise is for employees to identify things  that quickly change their mood from negative to positive. As simple as  it sounds, finding a personal happy place, going there and then coming  straight back to work might key to expediting recovery time.‚Äù &lt;‚Äî e.g. a bicycle ride, walk or trip to a cafe!

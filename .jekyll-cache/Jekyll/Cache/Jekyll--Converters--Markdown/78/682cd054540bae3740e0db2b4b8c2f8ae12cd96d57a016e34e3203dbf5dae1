  <li>What will you miss when <a href="http://www.bookstocooks.com/">Barbara-joâ€™s Books to Cooks</a> <a href="http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=448aa9fd599f08ed28b38ec8a&amp;id=6440777843">closes on February 28, 2017</a>?</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ll  miss her genteel presence, fantastic curated selection of books and the fab staff when Barb (my wife Barb, not Barbara-jo :-)!) worked there.</li>
  <li>Above all, Iâ€™ll miss the fantastic atmosphere at one of the fabulous cookbook events: take a great cookbook, add a great chef (often the author or local celebrity chef!) cooking recipes from the book and a cozy atmosphere and it adds up to magic all under Barbara-joâ€™s watchful eye!</li>

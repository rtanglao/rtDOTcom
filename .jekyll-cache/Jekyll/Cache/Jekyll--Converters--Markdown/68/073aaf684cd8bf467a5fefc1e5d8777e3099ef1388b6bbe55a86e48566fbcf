    Introduction<br /><br />

    We are going to solve an overly simple, and unrealistic problem, which has the upside of making understanding the concepts of ML and TF easy. We want to predict a single scalar outcome, house price (in $) based on a single feature, house size (in square meters, sqm). This eradicates the need to handle multi-dimensional data, enabling us to focus solely on defining a model, implementing, and training it in TF.

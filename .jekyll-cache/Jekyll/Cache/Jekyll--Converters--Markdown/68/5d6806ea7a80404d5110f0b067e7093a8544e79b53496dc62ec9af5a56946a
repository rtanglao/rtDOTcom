  <li>Probably mis-read it but I loved Kim Stanley Robinsonâ€™s: The Ministry for the Future: terrible novel but great ideas so highly recommended :-) I agree that we have enough and giving $USD100,000 to everybody would fix 99% of all our problems. #ymmv But think about it an dread the book before casting the notion aside.</li>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>
"All these gifs are paginated R plots. You will see in the code that I used different approaches to converting individual plots to animated gifs. The first (not recommended) was to save files then do a system call to the ImageMagick convert tool. Through a simplystats comment, from Yihui Xie, I learned about the saveGIF function from the animation package, which is what I now use when the plots are made in R base. When using ggplot I use David Robinsonâ€™s gganimate package. Finally, if I want to add special effects, like phasing, I use the online Animated GIF maker."

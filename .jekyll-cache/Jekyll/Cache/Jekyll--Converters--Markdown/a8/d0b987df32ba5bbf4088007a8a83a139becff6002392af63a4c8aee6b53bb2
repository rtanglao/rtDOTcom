  <li>Rolandâ€™s paranoia about Android 6 aka Rolandâ€™s over-analysis of Karoo part 2 (<a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2017/12/03/p1-karoo-i-want-to-believe-but-i-also-dont-want-to-buy-a-new-bike-computer-every-2-4-years/">Rolandâ€™s over-analysis of Karoo part 1</a>)</li>
  <li>Based on the work folks response below, the worst that could happen is that you get mis-navigated and/or that the Karoo stops working because of an Android 6 hack that the Karoo folks donâ€™t patch. Not a worry because I donâ€™t trust navigation computers since I get lost no matter how accurate they are

"@roland it seems like an AOSP fork, so they could have a solid security/app model that limits enough attack surface.  and really, is that better or worse than whatever the h*ll G*rmin runs on?  :-)<br /><br />

I mean, itâ€™s a cycling computer with pretty finite functionality
<br /><br />
itâ€™s an interesting design, and the idea of a connected GPS without taking my phone on rides is nice"

  <li>All Right! Iâ€™ll revisit in Christmas 2018 and see how they are doing.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m more likely to buy the second version of Karoo because they are going to get some things wrong. And then stop supporting the 1st version.</li>
  <li>I guess no bicycle computer with software and connectivity and apps lasts forever. A simple bike computer that doesnâ€™t have connectivity is the only thing that lasts and how long will they last and will they provide the features I want? Probably not.</li>

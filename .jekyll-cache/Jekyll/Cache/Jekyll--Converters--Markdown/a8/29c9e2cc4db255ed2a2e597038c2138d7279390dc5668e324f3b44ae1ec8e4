<blockquote>
  <p>This species will fabricate quotes, sources, and references â€“ a lot of the time they just make things up that sound plausible. Their words are superficially impressive but largely lacking in substance â€” humans mostly produce what has been described as fluent bullshit. Humans mansplain, presenting reasoning free of evidence but with confidence in its own correctness on any topic, without regard for the audience. Like talking to a drunk person at a bar: wrong, but very confident about it.</p>

  <p>Yet humans really do accomplish a lot more than many thought possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans just spew words. It just so happens that we can decode them into something related, useful, and meaningful surprisingly often.</p>

I"c<p>The N97 has to go back to Womworld in England on Tuesday so here are my penultimate observations:</p>
<ol><li>There's a bug in the camera app which causes it to forget the GPS setting occasionally. This is annoying because this means I have to re-enable GPS every time I start the camera app (or at least double check that it is still on). Easily fixed I bet in a post V11 firmware update</li><li>The speakers are tinny but loud, great to listen to while riding my bicycle! Far better than iPhone mono sound!</li><li>The <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2009/07/12/n97-review-day-8-and-9-no-keyguard-lock-issues-not-impressed-pixelpipe-and-share">keyguard lock issue</a> came back today so it's not ShoZu or Sports Tracker causing it!</li><li>Needless to say multi-tasking with S60 (e.g. playing music with the music player, tracking your bicycle ride with Nokia Sports Tracker and taking photos) works great until you inevitably run out of RAM or the camera app crashes.It's ridiculous that you can run out of RAM with the N97 in 2009 as it is supposedly a "flagship" device. C'mon Nokia please put 256MB RAM or greater in the N97 successor</li><li>The GPS lock is faster than the N82 and N95 but I don't have time to measure how much faster. It seems a bit flakey compared to a dedicated GPS unit like the LD-4W which is disappointing but to be expected</li></ol>

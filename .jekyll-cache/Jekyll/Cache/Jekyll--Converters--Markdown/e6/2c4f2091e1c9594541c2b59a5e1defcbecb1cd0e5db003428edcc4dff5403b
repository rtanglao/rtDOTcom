I aim to get to a shareable link in the first 20 minutes (at most!). I like to use Netlify Drop for this. No account sign-up needed, and everyone knows how to drag-and-drop (see video below). It is very satisfying to get a link they can share with their mom/best friend/arch nemesis (kidding). I like to have everyone drop their links in a chat too, like a Slack, Google Doc, or a Gitter channel if doing a workshop. My favorite motto: “if it knits, it ships””</p>

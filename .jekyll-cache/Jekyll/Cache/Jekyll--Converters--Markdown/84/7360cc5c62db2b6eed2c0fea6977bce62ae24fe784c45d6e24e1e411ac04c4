I couldn't do the most basic thing and connect my terminal.app with my Python running on my Nokia N93. Aaargh!
</p>
<p>
I followed the <a href="http://www.eriksmartt.com/blog/archives/55">Using the Python for Series 60 Bluetooth Console from OS X</a> HOW TO from Erk Smartt but was unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
Invoking the Bluetooth console from the python app on the Nokia N93 worked but then after typing "screen /dev/tty.BT_CONSOLE", I get the following error messages: "Cannot open line '/dev/tty.BT_CONSOLE' for R/W: Resource busy " followed by "Sorry, could not find a PTY. ".
</p>
<p>
What am I doing wrong? I know I had this working with my Mac and Series 60 Python on the N70 back in the day so it's a bit frustrating!

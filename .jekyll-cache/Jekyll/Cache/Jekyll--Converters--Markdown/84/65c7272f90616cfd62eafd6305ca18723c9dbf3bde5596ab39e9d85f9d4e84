I"é<p>Some other pet peeves about mailing lists that arenâ€™t present in blogs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>quoted emails - on mailing lists I frequently get emails that have four or more  forwarded emails at the end.  This is waste of time and bandwidth: both computer and human!  And of course this doesnâ€™t happen in blogs because thatâ€™s what links are for!</li>
  <li>HTML and other funnies - mailing lists and clients donâ€™t handle HTML consistently so oftentimes email lists have emails that are impossible to read (e.g. Outlook sends both plain text and HTML and both are hard to read).  The HTML used in blogs for all its faults and inconsistencies is a lot easier to follow than the myriad ways of formatting HTML and plain text email.</li>
</ol>

I"»<p>Itâ€™s just that people (the diaspora and the ones living in the Philippines)  donâ€™t actually know beyond the common place and the cliche. Perhaps because it takes a lot of time and itâ€™s expensive to to check it out in the USA and Canada (and in the Philippines). Thereâ€™s way more to Filipino baking than just ensaymada, hopia, pan de sal etc etc. Check out <a href="https://panaderiaph.wordpress.com/panaderia-book/">Panaderia: Philippine Bread, Biscuit and Bakery Traditions by Jenny Orillos and Amy Uy</a> (https://www.facebook.com/panaderiaph/) to learn all about it. Itâ€™s not all overly sweet or bland. Itâ€™s that :-) and everything marvelously in between.

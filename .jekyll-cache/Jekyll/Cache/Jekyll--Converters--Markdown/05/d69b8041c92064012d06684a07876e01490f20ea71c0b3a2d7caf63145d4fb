My other worry is that there will be a rush to bring all the POSIX abstractions to WebAssembly via the component model....“I don’t want us to sleepwalk into 1970s operating system paradigms. We can do so much better, and I really want developers to think hard about this when they start to pick up WebAssembly as a technology.”</code></p>

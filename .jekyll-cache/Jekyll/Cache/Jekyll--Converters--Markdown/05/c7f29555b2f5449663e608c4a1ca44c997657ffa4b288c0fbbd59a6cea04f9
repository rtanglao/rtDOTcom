It’s a neat way to take advantage of the tools I’ve built to help make Datasette easy to deploy—not just on Glitch but on platforms like Fly as well.</code> &lt;– glitch is super powerful if you can figure out how to use it :-) (I failed to fully understand my eleventy vancouver restaurant website) and cope with its limitations</p>

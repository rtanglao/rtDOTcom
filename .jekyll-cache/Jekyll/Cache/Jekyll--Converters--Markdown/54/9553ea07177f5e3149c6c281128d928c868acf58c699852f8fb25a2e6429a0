I"Ï<p> I think Jon is onto something.  <a href="http://www.meshconference.com/">Mesh</a> sounded great (could people blog more podcasts and videoblogs of the conference please? That&#39;s it, my goal will be to make sure that <a href="http://2006.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a> 2007 is 100% podcasted and videoblogged at decent quality, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/05/16/J1D0">sorry Tim but not everybody can do awesome HD video for everything</a>) but we are missing the common Web 2.0 thread that &quot;meshes&quot; everything together which  I think lies somewhere in open source, ubiquitous inexpensive broadband (fixed today and mobile tomorrow), RSS, people (not just white male Californians, but <a href="http://www.fullcirc.com/weblog/onfacblog.htm">women</a>, Canadians, Indians, Filipinos :-) , etc.) and &quot;Silicon Valley everywhere&quot; (including Vancouver in my biased opinion with great startups like <a href="http://sxip.com/">sxip</a>, <a href="http://dabbledb.com/">Dabble DB</a>, <a href="http://eqo.com/">eqo</a>, etc.) </p>

<p> <strong>QUOTE</strong> </p>
<blockquote> There was lots of good content and obviously some great energy. I&#39;m sure the successes of the show were a happy mix of good planning and putting everyone together to share and feed off each other. I definitely learned a lot, but for someone who is on a steady diet of VoIP and telecom conferences like VON, Internet Telephony and Globalcomm, this is a different world in many ways. Didn&#39;t hear much talk about VoIP or podcasting or SIP - stuff like that. But that&#39;s ok - Web 2.0 is about so many things. <br /> <br />And that&#39;s where the challenge lies for me. A lot of great perspectives were put forward at Mesh - both from the speakers and the attendees. However, there wasn&#39;t a lot of connecting the dots - maybe by design - but I&#39;m left with the feeling that for as much as I learned, I still don&#39;t have a sense how these things fit together. <br /> <br />This actually brings me back again to the Mesh logo. You can&#39;t help but be drawn into that image and the energy it seems to radiate - which is exactly what happened at the show - so, kudos for the logo designers. The energy was there alright, but like the logo, I didn&#39;t really feel that all the strands - yellow, blue, green, etc. - connected. They&#39;re oscillating around each other, and bumping into each other a lot, but never really intersecting or truly meshing into a unified form. At the end of the day, much like Earth at Creation, I&#39;d like to see this humming mass of energy and chaos sort itself out and unravel nicely like a ball of yarn. <br /> <br />My conclusion is that this did not happen, and I&#39;m concerned that for some, the conference was just a blur, like this.... </blockquote>

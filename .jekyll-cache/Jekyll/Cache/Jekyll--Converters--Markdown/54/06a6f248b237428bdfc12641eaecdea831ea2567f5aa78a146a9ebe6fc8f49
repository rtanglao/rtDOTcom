  <li>Ton raises some great points in his blog post:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2018/06/entropy-as-power-difference-or-why-its-always-easier-to-f-things-up/">Entropy as Power Difference, or Why Itâ€™s Always Easier to F Things Up</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Allow blog comments or just use ping back, trackback and Web Mentions?</li>
  <li>Since I started blogging in 1999, Iâ€™ve always disliked blog comments and hosting them but havenâ€™t really thought too much  about it.</li>
  <li>My current position: I think the best thing is to use something like ping back, trackback or Web Mentions and blog your comment in response to a blog.</li>
  <li>I agree that centralized comments always fail in time because of sp*m. And what Ton said about power and entropy :-)</li>
  <li>Someday :-), I will implement something like Web Mentions !</li>
</ul>

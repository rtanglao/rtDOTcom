<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

"It was a complete surprise. In fact, I didn‚Äôt know anything about it, and a colleague in the space sciences department, who is now a professor of astronomy at Cornell, Jim Cordes, saw me on the street ‚Äì he‚Äôs been a long time friend ‚Äì and he said, ‚Äúoh, by the way, did you know that your image is on the cover of Joy Division?‚Äù And, I said no, I had no clue. So I went to the record store and, son of a gun, there it was. So I bought an album, and then there was a poster that I had of it, so I bought one of those too, just for no particular reason, except that it‚Äôs my image, and I ought to have a copy of it."

It‚Äôs like sample code, we need more sample prompt sessions! Wonder if things have changed in March 2025 ; June 2024:: Simon Willison:: Building search-based RAG using Claude, Datasette and Val Town</a></p>

<p>Read the whole thing <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/21/search-based-rag/">June 2024:: Simon Willison:: Building search-based RAG using Claude, Datasette and Val Town</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for adding extra ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù to systems built on LLMs, allowing them to answer questions against custom information not included in their training data. A common way to implement this is to take a question from a user, translate that into a set of search queries, run those against a search engine and then feed the results back into the LLM to generate an answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I built a basic version of this pattern against the brand new Claude 3.5 Sonnet language model, using SQLite full-text search running in Datasette as the search backend and Val Town as the prototyping platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The implementation took just over an hour, during a live coding session with Val.Town founder Steve Krouse. I was the latest guest on Steve‚Äôs live streaming series where he invites people to hack on projects with his help</p>

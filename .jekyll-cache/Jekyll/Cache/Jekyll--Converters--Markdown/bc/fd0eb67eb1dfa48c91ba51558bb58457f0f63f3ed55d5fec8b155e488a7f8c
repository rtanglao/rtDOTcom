I"<p>I'll start using <a href="http://meaning.3xi.org/">Meaning</a> when it works reliably. To me, seamlessly uploading photos in real time is more important than cool location based meta data. Until then, I'll stick with <a href="http://shozu.com/">ShoZu</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The app is pretty heavy -- it's been built on a context platform that can do far more -- and it's difficult to sometimes run more than just the Meaning app on my 6630. The uploader is also subject to failures due to cell changes or flipping from 3G to 2G -- this can lead to many half uploaded photos that need deleting from Flickr, and also cost money due to mobile data transfer charges.</p>

<p>Despite these quibbles, Meaning is the uploader I have been using pretty much exclusively for the past few months. The rich metadata generated is worth far more to me than the few failings.</p></blockquote>

Read the whole thing! â€“&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Iâ€™ve (accidentally, bumblingly) found the fastest way to â€œlevel upâ€ my own â€œqualityâ€ of self (that is, to self-elevate into a higher plane of Good Archetypicalness, to strengthen my own backbone) is through parenting. I had the tremendous privilege of being a father figure to a kid for a few of these previous years, and nothing made me â€œbetterâ€ or more â€œmatureâ€ or more â€œinspired to crack open the worldâ€ for someone than interacting with this kid. The experience is difficult to capture in words; parenting truly is a bizarre short circuit of the brain, like a wormhole into otherwise inaccessible portions of the mind. In this way, parents who have an abundance of life force and time and mental space are â€œblessedâ€ in the literal meaning of the word â€” that is, they are promoted, like gods to their children, and have the power to establish the healthy parameters of life and possibility. There were weeks where itâ€™d just be me and this kid, and the conversations we had â€” lord, talk about expanding. I felt the edges of my own universe fly out as I witnessed the kidâ€™s own sense of spaciousness swell in their eyes. Given a single day I could teach this tiny human more than my father did in his entire life. No one has ever added more of a sense of value or self-worth to my life than this child. Five years ago, nothing in this paragraph would have made sense to me.</code></p>

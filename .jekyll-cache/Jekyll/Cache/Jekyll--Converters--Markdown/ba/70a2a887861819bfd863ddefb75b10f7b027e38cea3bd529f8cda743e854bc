I"*<p>OK, I really am going to have to try <a href="http://www.fondantfancies.com/shrook/">Shrook</a> now.  Jim and Cory Doctorow are enough triangulation for me!</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>
<blockquote> I installed Shrook 2 today. I had low expectations, and I'll admit the only reason they were low was because the web site was rather unprofessional looking.

Even if the site had been a thing of beauty, this app immensely EXCEEDED my wildest expectations! Shrook 2 is truly awesome software. It has a number of features that are truly incredible, like Distributed Checking (which means you get updates way faster without added bandwidth burden on the RSS feed servers), Smart Groups, the ability to flag (mark) items, and the ability to view the web page the item points to right in the app (it uses WebKit).

Oh, and you can have multiple Shrooks have synchronized subscription lists and read-status of items. That alone is a killer feature. At the bottom of the File menu is an "Import from NetNewsWire..." command. It worked perfectly and seemed to do its job instantaneously on my PowerBook G3 500.

I love NNW as well, but Shrook 2 meets my needs better.</blockquote>

What I'm trying to demonstrate here is that if you identify more with Person Bâ€”how they think, the paradoxes they carry, etc.â€”you will need to spend extra time taking care of yourself. There's a reason why Person A can "switch off" work more easily and seems to float through situations you find more difficult. ... Emotional labor, epistemic relativism, perspective-taking, navigating cognitive dissonance, and reflexivity are not "free." It's work, and it is draining. It is draining to navigate environments where (most people) are confidently sure of themselves or at least work hard to portray that. ... Here's the big risk I have experienced multiple times in my career. If you dig yourself into a hole too deep, you risk diminishing the skills you hold dear. You risk being polarizing and not extending the open-mindedness you value, especially toward the people you find most challenging (who often have significant power and influence). ... Be you. But be a sustainable version of yourself!</code></p>

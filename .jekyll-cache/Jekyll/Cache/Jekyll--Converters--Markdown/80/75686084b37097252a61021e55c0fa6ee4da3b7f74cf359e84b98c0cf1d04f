  <li>For the 3 other people interested in this (doesnâ€™t apply if you can manage to file your lost luggage report with Lufthansaâ€™s web app; instead I had to physically go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C3049</code> and then up the stairs to the right to the Lufthansa office at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C4100</code> to file my report in person):</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C3049</code> doorway to the Lufthansa office (who handle lost luggage) is NOT in a secure area even though the sign says it is in a secure area! It is to the right of the oversized baggage counter in international at YVR aka Vancouver airport</li>
  <li>For the record: I flew Ancona (AOI) to Munich (MUC) on June 24th, missed my flight to YVR on the 24th and then flew to YVR on June 25th and my luggage didnâ€™t show up. I tried to file a lost luggage report  via the web app on June 25th, 26th and 27th and failed so I went to the airport and filed a lost luggage report at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C4100</code> on Tuesday June 28</li>

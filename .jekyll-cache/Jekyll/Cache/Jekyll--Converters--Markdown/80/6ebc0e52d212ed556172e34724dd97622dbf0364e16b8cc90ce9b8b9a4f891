Fido data has come down in price since I blogged about this in <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2006/03/05/fido-mobile-data-is-a-ripoff-if-you-arent-grandfathered-with-an-unlimited-dataplan">2006</a> and <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/archives/2005/12/13/wireless-data-in-canada-is-ridiculously-expensive-boris-is-right">2005</a>. <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/the-travesty-of-canadian-mobile-data-rates">According to Boris</a>,  it now costs $4000 for 1GB of data on Fido instead of $4000 for 250MB, a bargain, NOT :-) And although Telus only charges $400 for 1GB, it's still too much especially for a network like Telus's where you can't use cool GSM devices only the cr*ppy CDMA ones.

Boris's graph says it much better though:

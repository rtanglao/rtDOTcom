  <li>Some Juicy Tidbits from <a href="https://snarky.ca/setting-expectations-for-open-source-participation/">Brent Cannonâ€™s Setting expectations for open source participation</a>:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Everything in open source should be a series of kindnesses</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pay for open source with kindness</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">But when someone in open source makes demands it's like the person passing through the door criticizing how I held the door open. It's pointless and simply leads to people no longer being willing to hold open doors for others.</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feedback must be constructive</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">negative feedback is never necessary. If you called a project stupid it helps no one. It doesn't help me because I can't act on being called stupid. And it isn't a kindness because you could have simply said that my project wasn't helpful to you for whatever reason</code></li>

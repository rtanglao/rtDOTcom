  <li>Glitch is recommended!</li>

      <li>ssume positive intent</li>
      <li>get a great microphone (USB wired headset form Plantronics or Logitech is my recommendation since they are rock solid or if you must wireless than fancy bluetooth like AirPods; I don’t use AirPods but many colleagues do and their audio quality is much better than the cheapie bluetooth headsets and don’t use the wired headset that comes with your iPhone or Android phone (if you do test it weeky because they fail silently!)) and</li>
      <li>get into an “office” routine: e.g. shower, change, put on your office badge, and go into “office” mode.</li>
    </ul>

Provide their own ‘AI’ ‘agent’? On:: Musings on Media in the Age of AI</a> &lt;– This sounds exactly like the ‘AI’ dream of the 1990s except with terabytes of data to pick from with more stuff online every second so maybe it will work this time?!? –&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">You stay still, but your AI agent goes out and fetches, distills, and synthesizes the content and renders it in whatever format you want — audio, video, or text. This is the future. None of the media business models will work in the future </code></p>

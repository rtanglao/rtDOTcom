      <p>Iâ€™d like to ask my personal AI chatbot things like â€œHow might I recast two book proposals Iâ€™ve written that didnâ€™t sell?â€ Or  â€œShow me the notes and transcripts of interviews I did for a Google story I wrote in 2002.â€ Or â€œGenerate the names and latest email addresses, sorted by story, of every person Iâ€™ve quoted in anything Iâ€™ve written. What did they say in those stories? Or â€œDescribe my method for writing and reporting stories for a journalism school class. Or â€œShow me videos I took of my kids before they turned five.â€</p>

  <p>Weâ€™re not there yet. But Googleâ€™s NotebookLM is close. I used it for this piece, uploading a 75 minute interview I did with its editorial director, Steven Johnson. Iâ€™d guess it reduced the story production time by 25 percent.  I asked it to write a 1000 word story and a 2000 word edited Q&amp;A based on the interview. Neither were bad first drafts. And they helped me draft this version much faster.</p>

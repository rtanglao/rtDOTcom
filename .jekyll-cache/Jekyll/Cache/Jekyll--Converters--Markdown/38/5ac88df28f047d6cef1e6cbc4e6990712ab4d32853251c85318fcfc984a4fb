<ul>
  <li>Rolandâ€™s podcast pontification posit: Any podcast over 5 minutes is probably too long :-) Including <a href="https://audioboom.com/over40invan">Over 40 in Vancouver</a>, the podcast that comes out weekly and that I collaborate on with the fab <a href="http://www.group42.ca/">Dale</a>.</li>
  <li>Do you listen to podcasts? Do you think they could be shorter? I bet you do. I bet you listen at 1.5x or even faster.</li>
  <li>Get to the point people :-) and/or edit or just have a hard 5 or 10 minute limit.</li>
</ul>

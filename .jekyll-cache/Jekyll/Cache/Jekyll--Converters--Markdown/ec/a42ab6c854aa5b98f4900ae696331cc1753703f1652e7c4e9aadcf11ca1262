I"Œ<p>We should mindfully and intentionally think about the best way to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">crispr</a> and self driving cars before deploying them. I doubt we will do so :-) but doesnâ€™t it make sense to think about the implications of easily remixing organisms in the case of crispr and the implications to jobs and society in the case of self driving vehicles?</p>

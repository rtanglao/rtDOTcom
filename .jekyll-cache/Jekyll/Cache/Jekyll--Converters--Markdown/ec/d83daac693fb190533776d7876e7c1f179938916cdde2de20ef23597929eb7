I" 	<p>As <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2005/02/17#When:8:25:44AM">Dave Winer said</a>, must read! And mainstream media, when you are ready to invite bloggers into the tent or do newspaper blogs, remember we have the <a href="http://bryght.com">technology</a> and we have a shining example, <a href="http://www.urbanvancouver.com/">Urban Vancouver</a>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006302&amp;ojrss=frontpage">The Blogs Must Be Crazy Or maybe the MSM is just suffering from freedom envy. - OpinionJournal - Peggy Noonan</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>Some publisher is going to decide that if you can't fight blogs, you can join them. He'll think like this: We're already on the Internet. That's how bloggers get and review our reporting. Why don't we get our own bloggers to challenge our work? Why don't we invite bloggers who already exist into the tent? Why not take the best things said on blogs each day and print them on a Daily Blog page? We'd be enhancing our rep as an honest news organization, and it will further our branding!
</p>
<p>Someone is going to address the "bloggers are untrained journalists" question by looking at exactly what "training," what education in the art/science/craft/profression of journalism, the reporters and editors of the MSM have had in the past 60 years or so. It has seemed to me the best of them never went to J-school but bumped into journalism along the way--walked into a radio station or newspaper one day and found their calling. Bloggers signify a welcome return to that old style. In journalism you learn by doing, which is what a lot of bloggers are doing.</p>

<p>Finally, someday in America the next big bad thing is going to happen, and lines are going to go down, and darkness is going to descend, and the instant communication we now enjoy is going to be compromised. People in one part of the country are going to wonder how people in another part are doing. Little by little lines are going to come up, and people are going to log on, and they're going to get the best, most comprehensive, and ultimately, just because it's there, most heartening information from . . . some lone blogger out there. And then another. They're going to do some big work down the road.

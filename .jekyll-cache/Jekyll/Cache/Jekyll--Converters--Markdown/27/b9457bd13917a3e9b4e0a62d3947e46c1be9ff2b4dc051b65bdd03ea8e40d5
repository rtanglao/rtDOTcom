I"U<p>If you are in Vancouver, have a Mac, legally purchased music and an iPhone or an phone that allows you to do MP3 ringtones that isn&#39;t locked down by your carrier, I&#39;ll teach you how to create your own ringtones and do 6 ringtones for you in exchange for a lunch ($17 steak frites + a glass of tap water) at <a href="http://www.julesbistro.ca/menu.html">Jules Bistro</a>. Seriously this ring tone thing is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2007/09/the_ringtones_racket">ridiculous</a>. Don&#39;t do it! Don&#39;t buy a song from iTunes and then buy it again for a ringtone. Please!</p>

fabrics. No matter how fine the piÃ±a, jusi, sinamay or pinukpok is, they tend to be somewhat
prickly, often causing rashes or skin irritations. This, combined with the tropical heat, could
be regarded as one of the main reasons why shirts of these kinds of material were worn
tucked out. It must also not be forgotten that baros were worn with tucked cotton shirts
underneath. Wearing these diaphanous baros without any undershirts would have been
scandalous, not to mention, uncomfortable</code></p>

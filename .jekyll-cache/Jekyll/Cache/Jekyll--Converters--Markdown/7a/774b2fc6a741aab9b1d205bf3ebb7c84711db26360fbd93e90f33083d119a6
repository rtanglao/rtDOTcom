I"^<p>Wow! Yet another cool but essential tagging related feature from Flickr. Go Flickr go! We need these features in other tagging apps.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.flickr.com/news.gne#139">Flickr: News</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>We've added a new way for you to manage your ever-growing list of tags. If you go to your tags page - you'll see a new link in the right-hand column to "edit, replace or delete your tags".
</p>
<p>The cool thing about being able to edit your tags from here is: say you select that you'd like to edit your photos tagged with "vancouver"... when you use the edit form, you can either a) edit the spelling, b) change "vancouver" to a completely different tag, or c) add more related tags to every photo already tagged with "vancouver", like "british columbia" or "canada".

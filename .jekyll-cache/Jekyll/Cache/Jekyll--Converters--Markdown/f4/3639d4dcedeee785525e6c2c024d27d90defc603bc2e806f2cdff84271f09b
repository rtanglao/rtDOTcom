I"D<p>I was part of the beta but never really had a chance to seriously try it out.  My thanks to the fine folks at Nokia including <a href="http://www.eriksmartt.com/blog/">Erik Smartt</a> for their support and encouragement and kudos for shipping Python 1.0!
</p>
<p>Here's what I want:
</p>
<ol><li> <a href="http://anarkystic.com/blog/">Andy</a>'s <a href="http://anarkystic.com/p/wiki/FlickrUp">flickrUp</a> ported to Python for Series 60</li>

<li>If possible, have  flickrUp run every 5 minutes automatically via a cron like facility if such a thing exists on Series 60, look for pictures from the camera app, post them to Flickr and delete them as soon as they are successfully posted.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If anybody would like to help Andy and I do this, let me know (604 729 7924 or roland AT bryght.com or leave a comment here)</p>

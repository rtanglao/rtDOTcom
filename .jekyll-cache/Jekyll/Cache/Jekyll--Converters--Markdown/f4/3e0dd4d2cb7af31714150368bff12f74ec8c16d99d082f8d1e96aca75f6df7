I will show you what I regard as the best method of defishing. Itâ€™s a technique that Iâ€™ve seen used only a handful of times by other photographers but the results can be great. Itâ€™s especially suited for landscape photographs that have a curved horizon but itâ€™s applicable to other types of photography too. I will, of course, be using it with landscape astrophotography. For the processing examples, I will be using Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop.</code></p>

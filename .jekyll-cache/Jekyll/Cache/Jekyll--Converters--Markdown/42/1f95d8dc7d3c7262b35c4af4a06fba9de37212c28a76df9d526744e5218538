  <li>During this pandemic I have discovered that for me, bicycling and cross country skiing are great outlets and necessary outlets to lessen my blues and just to clear my mind. In addition they are super fun things I have been doing forever :-) Bicycling since I was 4 or 5, cross country skiing since I was 24!</li>
  <li>This year the Cypress Challeng and the Tour</li>

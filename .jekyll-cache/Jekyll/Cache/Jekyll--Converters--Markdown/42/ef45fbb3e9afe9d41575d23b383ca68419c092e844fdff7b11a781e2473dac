I mean inevitable like compound interest‚Äîtiny, persistent, visible pressure applied in the same direction until the math changes. It‚Äôs slow, messy, and often invisible at first.</a></p>

  <p>This is why the Strong Towns approach matters even more in places like yours, where the problem isn‚Äôt preemption from above, but institutional entropy from within.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what breaks the cycle?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not a single lever. But here are a few that I think work together:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Narrative dominance</strong>. Most communities have no alternative story about why the current system fails. Our job is to provide that story, clearly, repeatedly, and with examples that show what‚Äôs possible. When councilmembers start hearing the same questions from multiple directions‚Äî‚ÄúWhy are we blocking gentle density that aligns with our values?‚Äù‚Äîthey start to feel the pressure shift.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Create visible wins</strong>. If the system won‚Äôt legalize ADUs by right across the board, help one homeowner do it as a pilot. Or find one that is grandfathered in and working well. Document everything. Turn the story into a column, a workshop, a visual. Sometimes the clearest path is to de-risk the unfamiliar by showing that it‚Äôs already working, quietly. The housing toolkit I shared with you is full or boringly normal people doing these things we want to ultimately seem boringly normal.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Strategic allyship inside the bureaucracy.</strong> You don‚Äôt need your entire staff to champion reform, just one or two mid-level staffers willing to help shape internal proposals, provide cost estimates, or identify the least risky way to get started. Celebrate their efforts publicly to protect them institutionally.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Feedback loops that don‚Äôt require council</strong>. Consider embedding reforms inside budget decisions, infrastructure maintenance plans, or administrative manuals. If you can‚Äôt change zoning directly, can you change how capital improvements prioritize walkable areas? Can you bake small wins into how staff scopes repairs?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Pressure from organized outsiders.</strong> Not state preemption, but organized citizen campaigns. If your commissioners and staff are stuck, outside groups (like a Strong Towns Local Conversation) can bring energy and legitimacy to the push. Don‚Äôt make it a demand for radical change; make it a call to implement the next smallest step.</li>
  </ol>

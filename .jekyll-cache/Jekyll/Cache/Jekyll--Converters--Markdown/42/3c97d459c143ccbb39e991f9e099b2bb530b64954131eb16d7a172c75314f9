It all changed on November 22 of course! SA is back as of Nov 22 ROFL :-) See: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23967223/sam-altman-returns-ceo-open-ai">November 21, 10PMish: Sam Altman to return as CEO of OpenAI</a> –&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">On the other hand, if the story here is “OpenAI’s board of directors found a Rogue Capitalism at OpenAI, and moved to kill it before it could destroy their nice nonprofit mission,” well, it’s also not clear that that worked. (It’s not clear that it’s true, either: Shear tweeted this morning that “the board did *not* remove Sam over any specific disagreement on safety, their reasoning was completely different from that. I’m not crazy enough to take this job without board support for commercializing our awesome models.”) Capitalism, like the metaphorical superintelligent robot, is pretty crafty. If the board killed the Rogue Capitalism at OpenAI, it will pop up again elsewhere. “Ahahaha you fools,” say Microsoft and the OpenAI employees and, like, the abstract concept of Silicon Valley startup investing generally. “You trusted in the formalities of corporate governance, I outwitted you easily!”</code></p>

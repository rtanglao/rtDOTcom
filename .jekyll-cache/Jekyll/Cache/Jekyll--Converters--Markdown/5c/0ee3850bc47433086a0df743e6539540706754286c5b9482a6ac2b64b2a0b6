Now I really have to try Tailscale so I run experiments on localhost:randomport with a real cert and public address!!!!!!!!!! Thanks again! &lt;‚Äì QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The second thing you can do is have your device‚Äôs Tailscale daemon itself terminate TLS. Then it can reverse proxy the HTTP requests to a local non-HTTPS webserver. That is, you run a webserver on localhost:8080 and we put it on the internet, complete with a public IP address, DNS, TLS cert, and HTTPS server. Now that‚Äôs a fun tunnel, if we do say so ourselves.</code></li>
  <li>Perfect for trying out something like <a href="https://codeberg.org/grunfink/snac2">snac2</a>? (fab ActivityPub server in C) so I can learn enough to re-implement it in a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù :-)  language like Haskell or Rust?!?</li>

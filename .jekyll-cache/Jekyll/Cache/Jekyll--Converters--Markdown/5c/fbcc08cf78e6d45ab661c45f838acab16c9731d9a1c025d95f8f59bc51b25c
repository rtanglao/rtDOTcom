  <li>Iâ€™m a wee bit tired :-) of ranting, insults and other non-constructive feedback</li>
  <li>I suggest that this non-constructive text be marked by admins from all of the websites that I work on and that once marked, have it visible only to the people who posted the non-constructive text. (The constructive-feedback text if any would be unaltered and visible to all)</li>
  <li>Examples would be google play store reviews. Volunteers who are replying to Google Play Store reviews shouldnâ€™t have to read endless insults when replying to reviews.</li>
  <li>Whatâ€™s the best way to do this? An add-on? A web app?</li>
</ul>

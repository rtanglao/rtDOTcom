  <p>It has eight parts, listed below:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Accept â€œfalling behindâ€ as the new normal. Learn to live with it and work around it.</li>
    <li>Understand that our sense of time has been altered by recent events.</li>
    <li>Forget â€œmastery.â€ Go for continuous, lightweight experimentation instead.</li>
    <li>Less coding, more developing.</li>
    <li>Yes, AI is an â€œalien tool,â€ but what if that alien tool is a droid instead of a probe?</li>
    <li>Other ideas Iâ€™m still working out</li>
    <li>This may be the â€œnew normalâ€ for Karpathy, but itâ€™s just the â€œsame old normalâ€ for my dumb ass.</li>
    <li>The difference between an adventure and an ordeal is attitude.</li>
  </ol>

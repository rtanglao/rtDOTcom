The chords I was talking about in my post were "triads", which means they are three simultaneous notes. A major chord is notes one, three, and five of a major scale. A minor chord is the same, but the middle note (three) is moved down one note, which we call "flat" or "minor". You can also skip the third and play just notes one and five ("open fifths" or "power chords") which I do a lot on mandolin.</code> QUOTE2: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A key is the combination of a scale and a starting note. For example, "C major" is a major scale starting a C, while "D major" is the same but starting on a D. Most songs in traditional, pop, folk, and rock music draw all their notes from a single key, and all their chords will be built out of notes from that key as well</code>

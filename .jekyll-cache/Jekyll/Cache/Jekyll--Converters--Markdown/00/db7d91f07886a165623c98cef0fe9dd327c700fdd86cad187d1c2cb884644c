<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Likely scenarios over the next 12 months
1. (More likely) Evolution within Omicron BA.2 to further increase intrinsic
transmission and to escape from Omicron-derived immunity. This
scenario sees lower attack rates with 2022-2023 epidemic driven by drift
+ waning + seasonality.
2. (Less likely) Another Omicron-like emergence event in which a chronic
infection initiated in ~2021 incubates a new wildly divergent virus. This
scenario sees high attack rates with epidemic driven by variant
emergence.

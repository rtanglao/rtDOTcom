I seem to have fixed <a href="http://www.rolandtanglao.com/archives/2004/11/17/how_do_i_prevent_my_hard_disk_hum_out_of_my_podcast">the humming problem</a>.  I really think it was the hard drive (later: weird as I typed the last sentence the hard drive started spinning loudly and I could hear the hum in my headphones so it's definitely the drive!).  I have changed nothing.  I am still using a cheap Labtec external mic on my Powerbook running 10.3.5.  Would love it if others could post their hardware setup (<a href="http://radio.blogware.com/blog/_archives/2004/10/11/158359.html">exactly what model of mic</a> (somebody posted a Radio Shack microphone model number but I couldn't find that here in Vancouver)? ) so we could all learn.  <a href="http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/2004/11/11#041111_03">Dave Slusher's software setup</a> looks cool and definitive but nobody seems to be sharing exactly which mic they are using.

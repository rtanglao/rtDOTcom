Like, the experience would be this: youâ€™re using your photos app or Zoom or expense filing SaaS tool, then you go to Settings and scroll aaaaall the way to the bottom, and tap a power user button that says â€œOpen Spreadsheet.â€...Then, magically, Google Sheets opens with all your data in it, and you can sort and query it in all the ways you couldnâ€™t before, and change the titles of your expense claims with spreadsheet functions and that all gets reflected back into the app, or build a callout to an AI to describe all your photos and add natural language tags, do it yourself or ask a friend who knows Excel functions, or whatever really. Anything the app developers didnâ€™t add because theyâ€™re building for the 80% use case, and youâ€™re building just for you.</code></p>

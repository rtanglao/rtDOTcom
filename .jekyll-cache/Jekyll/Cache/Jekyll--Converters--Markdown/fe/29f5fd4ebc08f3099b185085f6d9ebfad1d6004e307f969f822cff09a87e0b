I"<p>tl;dr:&nbsp;Surprised&nbsp;by the paucity of real-time geotagged photos on flickr. People seem to upload in batches many hours after the fact. Still looking for a cool real-time geotagged picture feed so I can do some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinkenlights">Blinkenlights</a> info visualizations in a web browser near you!</p>

<p>Since 2007, I have over <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">50000</span> 21000 (29000 non geotagged) geotagged photos uploaded on flickr from cameras most in real-time or near real time (a few minutes to a few hours after they were taken). I expected in 2010 that there would be many real-time geo tagged obsessive :-) photo uploaders like me. Enough to power a cool Blinkenlights info visualization.</p>
<p>Well I was wrong :-) Based on the info viz (<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/361757/CCC/geotaggedAvg18.html">geoTaggedAvg18.html</a>&nbsp;; <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/rth5/blob/master/geotaggedAvg18.html">github source</a> - tested Firefox 4, Chrome, iPhone 4, Android 2.1 - each dot is the average colour of a geotagged photo uploaded to 1 of 18 cities, there are 24 dots per row and then it wraps around after over 24) that I did in Javascript and HTML5 even in geo-tagging mad cities like New York and San Francisco and Vancouver, people don't upload geotagged photos in real-time to flickr (and I doubt elsewhere but love to be proven wrong, if anybody has a real-time updated photo stream with lat/long and an API that has more photos than flickr, please let me know:roland AT rolandtanglao.com twitter:@rtanglao). They do it after the fact and they don't do many.</p>
<p>Probably because:</p>
<ul><li>people are concerned about loss of privacy</li><li>uploading with GPS coordinates is too hard</li><li>GPSes are unreliable but getting more reliable every day</li><li>most people upload to social media ghettos like Facebook and Twitpic where most of their metadata including latitude and longitude is lost and/or not available via API instead of "<strong>fu</strong><strong>ll photos as social object with full-meta-data-preservation-and-APIs-to-get-the-meta-data</strong>" services like flickr</li></ul>

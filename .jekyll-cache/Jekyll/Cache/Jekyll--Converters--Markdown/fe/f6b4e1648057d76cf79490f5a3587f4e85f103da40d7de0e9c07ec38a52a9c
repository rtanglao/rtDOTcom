After using the <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/tags/n73-review">N73</a> for a while, not having 850 MHz and EDGE support on the N93 is painful simply because the reception is bad in my house (I guess and have heard that 850 is what Rogers is putting in and the lower the frequency the better it works indoors) and ShoZu uploads over GPRS are reaaaaaalllllllly slow. I will never again buy a phone without quad band support!

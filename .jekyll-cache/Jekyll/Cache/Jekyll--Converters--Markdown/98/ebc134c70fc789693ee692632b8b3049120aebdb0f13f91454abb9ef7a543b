  <li>My tl;dr of <a href="https://howsheilaseesit.blog/2017/11/29/why-dont-i-code/">Sheila MacNeill‚Äôs Why don‚Äôt I code?</a>: Not knowing how to code is a privilege for me and a reflection of a sexist-and-not-knowing-how-teach-math-properly-culture when growing up.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

I‚Äôm also still a bit scared of code and programming. Irrational I know ‚Äì but I might just actually break the internet üôÇ<br /><br />

However, Tony‚Äôs post has really made me think.  My irrational fear stems back to my early educational experiences. When I was at school and personal computers were coming of age it was made very clear that programming wasn‚Äôt for the likes of me ‚Äì a girl, not great at maths, not really interested in computers.<br /><br />

Those biased assumptions still lurk in the recesses of my psyche.  That‚Äôs why another bigger part of me does really support and believe in the need for continued support for getting young girls in particular into coding early.  It‚Äôs really important to know how things work, how as Tony says, easy it is to get things done and not just let others do it for you.  Of increasing importance now is being able to articulate what you think systems should do for you, to challenge how ‚Äústuff‚Äù (aka data) is stored, collected, used/abused.  Knowing about programming provides another way to have informed discussions about many, many other things.<br /><br />

So maybe I should make the time to learn to code a bit more and not abuse my privilege of letting others do everything for me."<br /><br />

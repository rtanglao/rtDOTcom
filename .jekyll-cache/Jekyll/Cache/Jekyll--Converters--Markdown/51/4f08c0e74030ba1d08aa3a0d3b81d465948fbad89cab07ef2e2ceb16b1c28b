I"h<p>Very cool, but ANT really needs an iPod or some such device that will play video on a colour screen for this to take off!</p>

<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote>ANT is a free application for MAC 10.3.
( we are working on a windows/linux version)
It is a video aggregator.
You subscribe to RSS 2.0 feeds with video enclosures.
ANT downloads new videos automatically.
You can arrange the video in the playlist, and then watch them in the viewer.</blockquote>

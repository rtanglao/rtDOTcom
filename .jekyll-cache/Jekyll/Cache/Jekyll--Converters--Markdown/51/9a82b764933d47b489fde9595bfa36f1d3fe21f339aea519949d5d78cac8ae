  <li>Glitch is recommended!</li>
  <li>Glitch‚Äôs guide: <a href="https://glitch.com/remote/">Glitch for remote work</a> is also  highly recommended</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve worked from home on and off over the last 15 years (usually for early or late meetings) but mostly at an office.</li>
  <li>Zoom is fantastic and so is slack and matrix, much better than irc and skype but whatever the toolset is I can only add is: assume positive intent, get a great microphone (USB wired headset is my recommendation since they are solid or if you must wireless than fancy bluetooth like AirPods; I don‚Äôt use AirPods but many colleagues do and their audio quality is much better than the cheapie bluetooth headsets and don‚Äôt use the wired headset that comes with your iPhone or Android phone (if you do test it weely because they fail silently!)) and get into a routine: e.g. shower, change, out on your office badge, and go into ‚Äúoffice‚Äù mode.</li>

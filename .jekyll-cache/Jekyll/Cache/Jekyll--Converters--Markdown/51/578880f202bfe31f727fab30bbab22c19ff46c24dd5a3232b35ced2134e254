I"Ñ<p> The N91 works flawlessly with my Apple Airport at home. Surprised! Go Nokia go (go Nokia Vancouver who I believe did most of the engineering on the N91!)! I am hoping that WiFi APNs appear just like normal APNs so any properly written app can you use it (which I think is the case judging by the many reviews I read this  morning when I should have been sleeping). Thanks to Andy, Brooke, Communicano and Nokia for the review unit. More review bits later! </p>

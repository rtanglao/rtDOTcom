<ul>
  <li>Still canâ€™t launch Firefox from Windows Subystem From Linux without a Selenium server and some hacks that nobody has w	working (Chrome works though)

      <li>above according to <a href="https://gist.github.com/danwhitston/5cea26ae0861ce1520695cff3c2c3315">browser_testing_on_wsl by danwhitston</a>:</li>

	The problem with browser testing in WSL is that it relies on opening and controlling a web browser, and browsers donâ€™t work on WSL at present as it deliberately doesnâ€™t include X Windows or some other GUI manager - itâ€™s meant to be command line after all. So while you can apt-get firefox, trying to actually run it isnâ€™t going to work.<br /><br />
	
	...<br /><br />
	
	For Firefox (incomplete)<br /><br />

    Install geckodriver on Windows. Note that the modern webdriver for Firefox is now known as Marionette, but that, if I understand correctly, the old webdriver is used for remote connections such as the one we're setting up.<br /><br />

    Try something similar to the Chrome code below, but with :firefox instead of :chrome<br /><br />

    Get errors such as 'Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: The path to the driver executable must be set by the webdriver.gecko.driver system property' and try Chrome instead<br /><br />

  <li>Oh well maybe Iâ€™ll eventually find the time to make it work with Firefox!</li>
  <li>In the meantime I wrote <a href="https://github.com/rtanglao/rt-kitsune-api/blob/master/open-day-in-browser.rb">open-day-in-browser.rb</a> which only works on Mac and not on WSL! Someday!</li>

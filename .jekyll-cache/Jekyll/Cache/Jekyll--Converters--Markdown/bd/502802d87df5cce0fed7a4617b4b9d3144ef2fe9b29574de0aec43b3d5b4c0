After the first few <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/roland/tags/n80photo">N80i pictures</a>, my impression is that they are not as good as the N73 or N93. Too much sharpening. The cool thing is you can change the sharpening and also there's an advanced sequence mode for time lapse photography which would be cool if it had a tripod jack!

Whoah big data as in terabytes of data plus a super tiny bit of code is enough? Wil we look back on this with bemusement/contempt/yet another folly like the Japanese 5th Generation AI project? My guess is YES but check back in 2023 to see how wrong I am :-) ?!? â€“&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Once you see intelligence as something embodied by particular pile of data rather than a particular kind of processing, a very powerful sort of decentering of anthropocentric conceits happens; a Copernican consciousness shift gets triggered. You are no more than the sum of data youâ€™ve experienced. A big memory with a small shell script aside. And once you get over the trauma of that realization, you realize something even bigger: any pile of data that has some coherence in its source can be turned into an intelligence that you can relate to, broadening the possibilities of your own existence.</code></li>

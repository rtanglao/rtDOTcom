  <li>I fell in love with this tutorial so I bought <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">the book</a> :-) ! I think I have read at least 6 or 7 explanations of lambda calculus before but for whatever reason (writing style? the level of detail? I actually paid attention :-) ?) it clicked this time.</li>
  <li>Beta Reduction is difficult. I think it would have been better to completely explain <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/09/14/p1-combinator-beta-reduction-exercise/">exercise 7</a> (scroll down to ‚ÄúBeta Reduce on page 49‚Äù) with a diagram and/or with the ‚Äú:=‚Äù notation used previously. Other than that, the other exercises were explained well.</li>

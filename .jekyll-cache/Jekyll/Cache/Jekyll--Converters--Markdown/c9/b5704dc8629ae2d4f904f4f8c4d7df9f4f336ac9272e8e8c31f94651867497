<blockquote>
  <p>For now, it seems that Bláœ‚esky PBC and the Táœ‚rkish government both have reached a situation that is acceptable for both parties. The Táœ‚rkish government has significantly restricted the visibility of accounts they deem unwanted. Sidestepping these restrictions remains an option, with new and easier ways to do so. But considering how powerful the default apps are and how few people use other apps, this seems likely to be an acceptable tradeoff. For Bláœ‚esky PBC it seems to be an acceptable outcome as well. Not complying with the government order would risk the app to be banned in the entire country. Using geographic moderation labelers gives compliance with the government order, while at the same time minimising the impact: the accounts in question are still visible outside of the country, and people within Táœ‚rkey have fairly accessible ways of sidestepping the ban.</p>

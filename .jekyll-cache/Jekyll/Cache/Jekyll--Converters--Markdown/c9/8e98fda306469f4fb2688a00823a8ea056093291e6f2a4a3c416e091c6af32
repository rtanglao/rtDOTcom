  <p>For travelers, I suggest trying to find a hotel in either an old town or a â€˜mediumâ€™ town. Often the latter can be a better choice, but it can sometimes be a bit difficult to parse exactly where said â€˜mediumâ€™ town is without getting your feet on the ground first. The satellite and Baidu street view can only tell you so much.</p>

  <p>Note that fancy western hotel chains often tend to be located within the new town. A local Chinese hotel chain, â€˜Jinjiangâ€™, is our usual go-to and tends to have hotels in a diversity of neighborhoods. Because it can sometimes be difficult to tell where exactly is most interesting to be located, a decent idea if youâ€™re staying in one city for a while is to only book two nights at first. This way you can easily change hotels if you find a neighborhood you prefer.</p>

  <p>For living, as I said before, I find those older â€˜commie blocksâ€™ livable enough and would totally live in one again in a pinch. However, for me at least, the best of all worlds is to find a newer development thatâ€™s flanking a â€˜mediumâ€™ town, an old town, or an urban village. This way you can get a little more light and space, while having all the benefit of being in a walkable neighborhood.</p>

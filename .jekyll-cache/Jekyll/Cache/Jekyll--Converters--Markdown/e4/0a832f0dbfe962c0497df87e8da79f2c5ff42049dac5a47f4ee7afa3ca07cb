Read the whole thing! –&gt; <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If you are a human out there in the vast wilds of the new internet of dead souls, speak up. We are still out there, on the small web, being ingested into indie search engine indexes, on blogs, on websites. ... The machines are thinking, but so are people, and they’re still much better. I’m still out here. Come be out here with me, too.</code></td>

  <li>I hope some of the ideas in NPR: <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/11/688876374/its-2050-and-this-is-how-we-stopped-climate-change">Itâ€™s 2050 And This Is How We Stopped Climate Change</a> actually get implemented by 2029.</li>
  <li>e.g. â€œThe Urbanization of Everythingâ€ which is happening in Canada with &gt;80% of folks living in cities or the near suburbs</li>
</ul>

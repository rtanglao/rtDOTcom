<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>We're excited to note today's announcement that Adobe has added support in the new version of Adobe GoLive CS2 for Movable Type and TypePad template tags. Our goal was to make it easier for weblog creators and designers to use the Adobe tools that many of you are already familiar with, while introducing the Adobe Creative Suite audience to the power, flexibility, and creativity of publishing with TypePad and Movable Type.</p></blockquote>

I didn't attend <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie</a>'s <a href="http://www.bloggercon.org/2004/10/07#a1546">Emotional Life Session</a>, but perhaps  I should have!

Julie is full of character, vibrant and a great soul.  Love to spend more time with her and the family perhaps over <a href="http://www.vaneats.com/">lunch in Vancouver</a> or at <a href="http://northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a> or maybe at a <a href="http://blog.meetup.com/1/">Seattle Blogger Meetup</a>.

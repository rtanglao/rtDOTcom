<p><strong>QUOTE</strong></p>

<blockquote>

Many companies working in the AI space today are at pains to make clear that these technologies are about augmenting human intelligence, not about machine intelligence replacing humans. This may seem like a PR platitude to avoid coming across like theyâ€™re in the business of putting people out of a job, but itâ€™s actually more than that. The type of AI thatâ€™s being used today, i.e. Machine Learning, doesnâ€™t just augment humans, it requires them.

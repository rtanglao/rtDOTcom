  <li>This is even straightforward than SSH :-) !
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>grok http 8001 <span class="nt">--subdomain</span> ryt-ds-flickr <span class="nt">--basic-auth</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"someuserid:somepassword"</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Finally I have another ngrok tunnel running that maps port 4000 to port 80 to see the rendered draft version at: https://rytjekyll.ngrok.io/ (userid: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">you</code> password: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rock+2023</code> &lt;‚Äì remove the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign :-) ) I am not sure how long this will remain up (at least until mid February 2023) because I not sure I can afford to pay for ngrok but we‚Äôll see :-)</li>
  <li>Super geeky :-) but then I can edit on any of my 3 laptops and 2 Raspberry Pis (including my MacBook Air) because this recipe will work on any computer that runs Visual Studio Code.</li>
  <li>Question: Does Typora or any other nice Markdown editor work over SSH? VS Code is fine but not nearly as nice as Typora! Maybe I should try my perennial favourite emacs‚Äôs Markdown mode?</li>

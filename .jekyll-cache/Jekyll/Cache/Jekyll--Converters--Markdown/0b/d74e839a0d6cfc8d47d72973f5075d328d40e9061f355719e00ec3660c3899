The basic idea was to recognize all the relevant traits, and then apply an Aristotelian taxonomy to make the classification. But Iâ€™d found, along with everyone else, that this didnâ€™t really work, among other things because itâ€™s at least as hard to recognize the relevant traits as to recognize the final category.â€</p>

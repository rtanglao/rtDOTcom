<ul>
  <li>My work-purchased Alienware 2014 Windows Desktop with Windows 10 doesn’t work with my bluetooth A2DP headphones yet the same headphones work with iOS, Android and OS X! Silly!</li>
  <li>Why? Because somebody broke the drivers for Bluetooth and/or changed them between Windows 8 when this PC came out and when Windows 10 came out? And Microsoft or Alienware did’t bother to update the drivers?!?!</li>
  <li>If I can find a firmware update for the Alienware motherboard (since the bluetooth is on the motherboard) I bet that would fix it.</li>
  <li>Or I suppose I can add a Bluetooth dongle.</li>
  <li>This is unacceptable Alienware and Microsoft. This totally reminds me of S*msung and their refusal to update the firmware on their phones after about 1.5 to 2 years which is also unacceptable.</li>

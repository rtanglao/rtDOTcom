Shall we call it “Weirding (sadly mostly in a negative sense) for the rest of us” :-) ? –&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Things have gotten really damned weird. The point here is that Bruce
is right - the technolgically-enabled Modern Era is at least
suffering under its own weight, if not collapsing. I think
Cronenberg on Star Trek is a great metaphor - the Pandemic triggered
the next era.  Bruce is also right that there ain't a normal anymore
(and what if we thought there was one, ok.)...This may seem like a scattershot of chaotic factoids that create a
gestalt, and I hope you get that.  It's a metaphor of the times.</code></p>

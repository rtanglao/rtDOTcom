      <li>Nikita Jamjoshi:: <a href="https://nikitanamjoshi.substack.com/p/the-age-of-ai-face">The age of AI Face</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So before the flood of AI faces desensitize our brains, let’s all take a minute to appreciate what actual humans look like. Go to the grocery store or a coffee shop, take a look at everyone around you, and marvel in their humanness.</code></li>
      <li>Adam Mastroianni:: <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-decline-of-deviance">The Decline of Deviance</a> &lt;– Another <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">For the first time in history, weirdness is a choice. And it’s a hard one, because we have more to lose than ever.</code></li>
      <li>Jia Tolentino:: <a href="https://archive.is/lBZtE#selection-327.0-327.25">The Age of Instagram Face</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What did it mean, I wondered, that I have spent so much of my life attempting to perform well in circumstances where an unaltered female face is aberrant? How had I been changed by an era in which ordinary humans receive daily metrics that appear to quantify how our personalities and our physical selves are performing on the market?

      <li>Lisa Abend:: <a href="https://archive.is/T8qxM">How Kinfolk Magazine Defined the Millennial Aesthetic…and Unraveled Behind the Scenes</a> &lt;– <strong>QUOTE</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">So ubiquitous a signifier did Kinfolk become that parodies popped up to satirize what they took to be its bland, elitist, and exceedingly white omnipresence. One site, the Kinspiracy, simply collected the copycat images from Instagram and published them beneath the tagline “Kinfolk Magazine: Making White People Feel Artistic Since 2011.”</code></li>

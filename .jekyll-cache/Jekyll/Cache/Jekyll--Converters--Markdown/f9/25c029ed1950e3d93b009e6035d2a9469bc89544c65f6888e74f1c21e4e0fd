<blockquote>
  <p>This reframes the â€œwhyâ€ of using AI. From this perspective, the only justification for integrating AI into a learning process should be to support and sustain intellectual labour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, when the â€œhowâ€ of AI is used to bypass the very struggle that builds virtue (by exercising intellectual labour, including analysis, deliberation and judgment), it directly undermines the â€œwhyâ€ of the assignment. A graduate student who generates a descriptive list of pertinent research about a topic without engaging with the sources skips the valuable process of synthesis and critical engagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Dewey, learning happens through doing, questioning and grappling with complexity, not by acquiring information passively. Assignments that reward perfection and correctness over process and growth further incentivize the use of AI as a shortcut, reducing learning to prompting and receiving rather than engaging in the intellectual labour of constructing meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is where an â€œethics of careâ€ becomes indispensable. As philosopher Nel Noddings proposed, a care-based approach prioritizes relationships and the needs of the individual over rigid, universal rules. It moves away from a one-size-fits-all policy and toward discretionary judgment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deciding the â€œwhenâ€ requires educators to know their learner, understand the learning goal and act with compassion and wisdom. It is a relational act, not a technical one.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Educators must ensure that AI supports rather than displaces the development of core capabilities.</p>

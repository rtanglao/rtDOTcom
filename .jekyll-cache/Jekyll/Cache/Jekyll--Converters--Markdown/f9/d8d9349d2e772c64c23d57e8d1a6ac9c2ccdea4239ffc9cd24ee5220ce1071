There was improvement in fatigue, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, brain fog, disequilibrium, orthostatic intolerance, and neuropathic pain. (Minocycline is an antibiotic, but also has a number of protective effects on neurons.)</code> &lt;- Read the whole thing! Need more studies!</p>

<h2 id="caveats-again-quoting-ducky">Caveats again quoting Ducky</h2>

<p>Oral minocycline does frequently give unpleasant levels of nausea and/or dizziness, so it‚Äôs not an ideal medicine. Also please note that</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not everyone was helped;</li>
  <li>People who had ME/CFS for longer were helped less;</li>
  <li>This was not a randomized trial ‚Äî there was no control group, so partly this might be placebo effect.</li>
  <li>These weren‚Äôt the sickest Long COVID patients: people had to be able to stand and walk (and, it appears, to come to a hospital) in order to participate in the study.</li>
  <li>Most of the improvement was in people who had Long COVID for less than six months, so maybe they would have recovered on their own.
However, it is encouraging news!</li>

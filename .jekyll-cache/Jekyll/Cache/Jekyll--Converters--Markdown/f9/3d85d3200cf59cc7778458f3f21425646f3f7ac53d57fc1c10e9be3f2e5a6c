<ul>
  <li>This is my long term goal: A “Photo Metadata Database for flickr and instagam”</li>
  <li>The database could be mongodb or redis ! Basically anything that stores json and has a decent query language.</li>
  <li>Poll the flickr and instagram API once an hour. Get the average colour and all the other meta data including lat/long.</li>
  <li>Use the meta data to make infographics and visualizations (which could be turned into t-shirts) once an hour.</li>
</ul>

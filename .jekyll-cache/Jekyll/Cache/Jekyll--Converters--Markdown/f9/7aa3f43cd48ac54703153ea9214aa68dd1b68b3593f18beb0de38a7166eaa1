<p>To close the loop: Contrary to what Prynt support told me [1] in November about <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2016/11/21/p1-printable-area-prynt-zink-the-full-620x1120px/">Prynt Zink 2x3 inches - Is printable area 620x1120 or something smaller?</a> <strong>the Prynt printable area is 2 inches by 3 inches</strong> (at least it is with the Samsung S5 Android Prynt App as of June 23, 2017)</p>

    "The Prynt Case uses ZINKÂ® (Zero InkÂ®) Printing Technology that produces photo-quality, full-color photos (313Ã—339 DPI or 620Ã—1120 px)" Can i print on the full 620x1120px or is the actual area that is printed smaller? If smaller what are the dimensions in pixels? Cheers! ...Roland<br /> <br />

  <li>Two days ago, I had coffee with the fabulous <a href="https://stephenrees.wordpress.com/">Stephen Rees</a>.</li>
  <li>He agreed with me (and I believe that I learned this from Stephen, I don’t have original thoughts on this subject :-) !) that it’s time to go on a WWII-style war-time footing against global warming and we should be trying to decrease carbon and temperature rise not merely stop increasing it!</li>
  <li>So much more wisdom that I hope he can blog about; can’t do his words justice!</li>

  <p>To those of us in public health, it feels like the world is on fire. We’re watching the systematic dismantling of institutions that have protected Americans from disease for decades. But to most people? They have no idea any of this is happening.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The damage isn’t just rhetorical. In six months under Kennedy:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The CDC has lost nearly half its budget and thousands of employees.</li>
    <li>He fired all vaccine advisory experts, replacing them with vaccine skeptics.</li>
    <li>Multiple CDC leaders have resigned in protest.</li>
    <li>The agency is described as broken by former directors.</li>
    <li>Important programs targeting cancer, heart disease, strokes, lead poisoning, injury prevention, and violence have been severely weakened or defunded.</li>
    <li>The largest measles outbreak in a generation occurred during this period, while Kennedy downplayed the importance of vaccines and promoted unproven treatments.</li>
    <li>Funding for global vaccination efforts protecting millions of children worldwide has been halted.</li>
    <li>Jim O’Neill, a non-medically trained investment adviser, was appointed as acting CDC director, raising concerns about leadership expertise.</li>
    <li>A gunman attacked CDC staff, motivated by Covid vaccine opposition.</li>
    <li>The agency’s focus was narrowed to infectious diseases only, abandoning key chronic disease and injury prevention roles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Writing out these bullet points feels futile because it is difficult to convey the magnitude of destruction. This is demolition, not reform. And it’s happening while the public thinks Kennedy is fighting for them.</p>

I"€<p> I just tried to upload the <a href="/rt/I%20just%20tried%20to%20upload%20a%20148MB%20MPEG-4%20file%20taken%20with%20my%20Nokia%20N93%20and%20it%20failed%20with%20this%20error:%20">148MB MPEG-4</a> video taken with my Nokia N93 from <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/2436">yesterday&#39;s Vancouver League of Drupalers meeting</a> and it failed with this error: &quot;Problem getting information from upload form. &quot; I guess there&#39;s a limit? Say 50MB or 100MB? (which is typical and reasonable; AFAIK only Google videos allows over 100MB videos in my experience). </p>
<p> I tried to do the right thing and read the docs  but none of the links work. i.e. guidelines, terms of use, faq and forum </p>
<p> All are 404 except faq which displays the questions but no answers in Firefox 2 on Mac. </p>
<p> It would be great to see a follow-up post about this because it&#39;ll be a very cool thing to have working! </p>

<blockquote> Pocketcine provides a way for you to transfer data from your computer to your phone (or potentially other people&#39;s phones) using WAP. Our Phone Uploader service is free, although you will incur data charges with your carrier. We downloaded a 500kb movie to our phone for $0.15 cents. You send the image, sound, application (midlet) or video to our server and then use your phone&#39;s browser to download the media file to your phone. <br /> <br />Click <a href="http://pocketcine.com/uploader/">here</a> to use the service now. <br /> <br />Jim Udall actually used part of the code we have on our site to build his mobile services platform. What is particularly useful about Jim&#39;s software is that it will query the phone requesting a file to download and  transcode the video in the right size and format. He has also developed code that allows you to put a button on your website, making the whole process of downloading to the phone much faster and simpler. Unfortunately the service is not yet available on a commercial basis. </blockquote>

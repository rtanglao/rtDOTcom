  <li>Tested positive for COVID 19 on May 3, 2024</li>
  <li>Tested negative for Covid 19 on May 10, 2024 and May 12, 2024</li>
  <li>Fever on day 1 was gone on Day 2</li>
  <li>This time I had headache and sore throat for 4 days and then it was gone</li>
  <li>Pretty sure my 5 vaccinations  prevented it from being worse. Go science go!</li>
  <li>Not sure where I got it but my guess is my dentist (who unlike my other 2 dentists didnâ€™t have the expensive air purifiers). If  thatâ€™s the case I guess weâ€™ll never know because no contact tracing since 2021 sad face.</li>

  <p>do you remember fixed wireless access from the 90s and 2000s at Nortel? Neither do I :-) Itâ€™s 2026 so I have Rogers 5G Home Internet and itâ€™s upload speed is 10x my Telus DSL. Apparently, Telus wonâ€™t turn on their fiber until their accountants tell them to for our 1995 10 unit condo (by 2030?) and I canâ€™t have both Shaw and Telus because my condo only has 1 wire (itâ€™s supposed to have both by law but reasons?!?!).  So I bought this service on a lark :-) since thereâ€™s no contract.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sounds like itâ€™s time to switch to Shaw cable internet which has the same upload speed. I call Telus every year and ask about fiber but Iâ€™m fed up waiting for them to turn it on :-) My neighbours in a brand new  4 plex across the street have Telus fiber so itâ€™s ready, just need to flip a switch or so I am told by Telus contractors :-) but accountants or something :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been told conflicting stories about Telus fiber IRL at Telusâ€™s store and also by Filipino :-) call centre agents in the Philippines and by Telus contractors who installed the fiber that goes to all of the newly built residential buildings on my block . Oh brother :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And I am 100% sure that Telus fiber if/when I get it, will be a lot better than Rogers or Shaw or Fixed Wireless Access from Rogers or Fido but Iâ€™m fed up waiting :-) and calling yearly. Iâ€™ve called once year since at least 2018 LOL</p>

  <p>@tedmielczarek â€œfiber to the curbâ€ is our situation not â€œfiber to the riserâ€ is what i believe what we called it in the Nortel days (I worked there for 13 years!!!)</p>

It obsolesces consent by cookie notice and replaces it with a choice of privacy agreements that you proffer as the first party, and the website or service agrees to as the second party. This sets the stage for both parties to trust each other and develop mutually respectful relationships if they wish. Optionality is maximized, from â€œlet aloneâ€ at one end to â€œtrusting relationshipâ€ at the other.</code></p>

  <li>I am experiencing the issue where after Sonoma 14.4 my USB ports on my dock mysteriously stop working! i can make it work by following this workaround/USB ‚ÄúSpellcraft‚Äù :-) formerly known as USB v**doogit (posting it here in case others can benefit):</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>unplug the USB-C cable from the Mac to the Thunderbolt dock</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>power off the Thunderbird 4 dock</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>power off my ultra wide monitor which has a built-in USB-A hub (the USB-A hub might be the culprit, should have üôÇ bought a more expensive monitor with a USB-C hub)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>power on the monitor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>power on the dock</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>re-attach the USB-C cable from the dock to the Mac</p>
  </li>
</ol>

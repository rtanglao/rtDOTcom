  <li>I agree and disagree :-) with DHHâ€™s <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/back-to-windows-after-twenty-years/">Back to windows after twenty years</a>. Iâ€™ve been using Windows for work for about 2 years after using Macs for work from 2003-2017. In fact for work <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/10/11/p1-surface-x-in-late-2020-2021-if-zoom-works-wsl2-works-good-reviews/">Iâ€™ll probably double down and get an ARM64 Windows machine in 2020 or 2021 primarily for the battery life</a>.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s 2019: Windows is a viable choice for non developers and developers who can develop in the cloud or donâ€™t mind WSLâ€™s slowness (which is being improved weekly to M*crosoftâ€™s credit)</li>
  <li>#ymmv of course especially if you depend on a Mac-only program. I miss Omni Outliner for example but that wonâ€™t cause me to switch  back (for work, if Iâ€™m paying my own $ Iâ€™d still buy a Mac).  <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2018/11/25/p1-checkvist-webapp-for-outlining-good-so-far/">Checkvist</a> and other cross-platform web apps are fine replacements.</li>
  <li>#ymmv for video and photo editing as well but call me kr*zy but I prefer doing that on iPhone and iPad over desktop.</li>
  <li>And finally WSL is great but really isnâ€™t it training 1000s of folks who do light weight development that LInux development is better than Windows or Mac development. i.e. WSL is the gateway to a real Linux laptops and desktops right?</li>

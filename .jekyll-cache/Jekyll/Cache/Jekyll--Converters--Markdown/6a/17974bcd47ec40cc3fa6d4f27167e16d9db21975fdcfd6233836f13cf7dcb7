Other strategies for keyword extraction generally rely on either statistics (like inverse document frequency and term frequency) which ignore context, or they rely on machine learning, requiring a corpus of training data which likely will not be suitable for all applications. TextRank is found to produce superior results in many situations with minimal computational cost.</code></p>

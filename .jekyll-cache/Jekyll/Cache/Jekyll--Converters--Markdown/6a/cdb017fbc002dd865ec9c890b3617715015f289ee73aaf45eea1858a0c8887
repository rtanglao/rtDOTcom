  <li>From <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2020/10/26/p1-cultural-analytics-lev-manovich-reading-notes/">Cultural Analytics</a> (<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/cultural-analytics">book website</a>) page 197-198:

      <li>“Although these techniques and projects are commonly discussed as information visualization, is it possible that they represent something else … a new broad visualization method for which we do not yet have an adequate name.”</li>

    </ul>

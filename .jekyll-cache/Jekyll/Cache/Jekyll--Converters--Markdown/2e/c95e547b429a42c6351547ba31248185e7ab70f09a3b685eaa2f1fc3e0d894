I"<p>Rogers implements kludgey SMS &quot;you are now getting r*pped off&quot; alert system instead of reasonable data plans. Title says it all. Instead of wasting money on designing, implementing and telling customers about this system, why not have reasonable cost data plans e.g. $50/month for 1GB, $60 for 2GB (and if there are good business and technical reasons why you can&#39;t do this even though other countries can, please communicate them)? Oh well now you know why billing software is a billion dollar business.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.iphoneuser.ca/2008/05/rogers-and-fido-data-alerts.html"><cite>Rogers and Fido Data Alerts | Canadian iPhone User - iPhoneUser.ca</cite></a>: (via Tod Maffin)  &lt;p&gt;<strong>QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is a new feature from Fido and Rogers that is available now to all subscribers. The system will automatically send you a text message to alert you when you are using pay per use data. This is especially important for people using an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is even more important for those who are using the $7 unlimited surfing plan. The system will tell you if you are incurring pay per use data charges. If you don't get a text, you should be fine. If you do, watch out and stop using data.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;You will receive a warning text at thresholds such as:<br />   - $10, 20, 50, 75, 100&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is available right now for people who are not on any sort of data plan. It will begin working on May 18th for those on a data plan such as the $7 plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;<strong>END QUOTE</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

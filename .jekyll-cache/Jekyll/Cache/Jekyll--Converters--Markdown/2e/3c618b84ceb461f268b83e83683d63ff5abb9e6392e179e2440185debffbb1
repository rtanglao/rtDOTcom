Yes! Sign me up for the beta in July! Can't wait for Skype on the N800! Looking forward to doing a head to head comparison versus Gtalk and gizmo!

I'm getting ready to leave NYC and the Digital Experience show, but had to share one tidbit before leaving. Among the many booths I stopped at was the Nokia booth. The big news there wasn't a new device, it was a service, and that service is Skype! It's been a long time coming, but Skype support for the Nokia N800 is right around the corner. I got a chance to see it, but it won't be available as a download until some time in July. The Nokia N800 already supports Gizmo for VoIP, but the addition of Skype adds more choice to make a good mobile device an even better one.

Let the public make it. - Columbia Journalism Review</a> &lt;â€” everybody can and should be a journalist like everybody can should be a software developer using things like spreadsheets! â€“&gt; QUOTE: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The people of Rio de Janeiro have developed one of my favorite things: a simple solution to a complex problem. Here, we had a problem of monumental importance, that everyone enjoying the beach that day could understand but no one could have solved on their own. It wasnâ€™t about the tall man playing the lead role, or the first person to start clapping, or the frantic parent. The best response to the crisis of a child lost on a beach is not to ask a few people to mount a search for a parent. It is simply to get more people involved, at a level at which everyone is willing and able to participate; it is to draw power from the crowd, rather than rely on a small group.</code></li>

<p>Read the whole thing: <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/[2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming">Geoffrey Litt:: Malleable software in the age of LLMs</a></p>

<p>If this hypothesis indeed comes true, we might start to see some surprising changes in the way people use software:</p>

<p>One-off scripts: Normal computer users have their AI create and execute scripts dozens of times a day, to perform tasks like data analysis, video editing, or automating tedious tasks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One-off GUIs: People use AI to create entire GUI applications just for performing a single specific task‚Äîcontaining just the features they need, no bloat.</li>
  <li>Build don‚Äôt buy: Businesses develop more software in-house that meets their custom needs, rather than buying SaaS off the shelf, since it‚Äôs now cheaper to get software tailored to the use case.</li>
  <li>Modding/extensions: Consumers and businesses demand the ability to extend and mod their existing software, since it‚Äôs now easier to specify a new feature or a tweak to match a user‚Äôs workflow.</li>
  <li>Recombination: Take the best parts of the different applications you like best, and create a new hybrid that composes them together.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these changes would go beyond just making our current software production process faster. They would be changing when software gets created, by whom, for what purpose.</p>

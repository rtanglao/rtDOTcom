  <li>This is why I love the premise of <a href="https://alpha.iodide.io/">iodide</a> as I understand it :  you donâ€™t need a server! Any web browser can run your notebook code just like any web browser can render your static web pages. No extra server required.</li>
  <li>Anyways,  I am probably over-thinking the need for a server. We will always need servers :-) ! Itâ€™s just that every node even if itâ€™s just a laptop running a browser should be a server as well as a client!</li>
  <li>Check out the intro post: <a href="https://fastpages.fast.ai/fastpages/jupyter/2020/02/21/introducing-fastpages.html">introducing fastpages</a></li>
  <li>And then check out Stephen Downeâ€™s attempt to clarify the introducing fastpages :-) :  <a href="https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2020/02/how-to-use-fastpages.html">How to Use Fastpages</a></li>
  <li>All in all something I should try!</li>

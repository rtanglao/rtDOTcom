I"®<p><a href="http://www.byte.org/">Ross</a> nails it! Every app (spreadsheets, SAP, wordprocessors, iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD, etc.) that can create any kind of content (text, video, audio, etc.) should have a â€œSave to blog functionâ€ that uses the MetaWeblog API today and the Atom API (when itâ€™s ready; unfortunately it is not ready today!).  Heck â€œSave to Blogâ€ should be an API built into the operating system just like â€œSave to Fileâ€ is.</p>

<blockquote>There is one last bit that would make WebGrabit a killer app for me - give it a "Publish to Blog" function that would allow me to take any bit of text from the WebGrabit RSS Desktop Component, format it, edit it, add to it and allow me to save it directly to Random Bytes as a weblog post.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œThe president, offering no evidence, insisted upon his version of the story.â€
â€œThe president extemporized with a blithe disregard for established fact.â€
â€œConfounding experts and antagonizing the historical record, the president painted his own, rosier portrait of events.â€
â€œThe president, perhaps inadvertently, wound up smudging the line between empirical verification and his own boundless optimism.â€
â€œThe president once again found himself galloping ahead of realityâ€™s leisurely pace.â€
â€œThe president dabbled anew in the shallow pond of misrepresentation, filling his beak with succulent morsels hidden among the reeds.â€
â€œThe presidentâ€™s most recent encounter with the specter of honesty caught him wrong-footed.â€</p>

<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m always looking for a way to make apps on iOS and Android that are command line and / or GUI-less.</li>
  <li>Perhaps Kotlin fits the bill?</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html">getting started with Kotlin tutorial</a> sounds â€œeasyâ€. Phrase like â€œfairly simpleâ€, â€œextremely easyâ€ make me LOL. Sure itâ€™s easy if you done this 8 million times i.e. tried many many procedural languages, SDKs etc but itâ€™s never easy for people if they are new to this crazy â€œrealâ€ programming game. I usually find it easy to get the â€œHello Worldâ€ working but hard to do what I want which is read the sensors like GPS and make graphics which somehow is never part of â€œHello Worldâ€ :-) ! (And Iâ€™ve programmed 10,000 line C applications you think it would be easier for me :-) !</li>

Itâ€™s extremely easy to start using Kotlin for Android development. In this tutorial weâ€™ll follow the warming up process with Android Studio.

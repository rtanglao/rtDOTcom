  <li>Iâ€™ve had the <a href="http://rolandtanglao.com/2019/05/30/p1-hello-world-from-arm64-windows-lenovo-c630-yoga/">Lenovo C630 Yoga ARM64 / AARCH 64 Windows 10 laptop since June 1, 2019</a>.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s great; great battery life, Firefox well, but there are quirks that might be showstoppers for you.
    <ul>
      <li>USB is flakey; it doesnâ€™t work well in Zoom (not sure Zoom supports ARM64)</li>
      <li>WSL 2 doesnâ€™t work (it works on some ARM 64 laptops like the Samsung Galaxy Book 2)</li>
      <li>IA Writer doesnâ€™t work with WSL files (I use Typora w)</li>
    </ul>

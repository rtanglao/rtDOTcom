I"<p> I&#39;m testing out the private beta of <a href="http://www.shozu.com/">ShoZu</a> 2.0 on my N70 tonight. The old stuff seems to work fine and I love ZuCasts which is an automatic downloader for selected video blogs (it would be much better if I could decide which videblogs I want rather than choosing from somebody else&#39;s list)  for your mobile phone. Great stuff! </p>
<p> If I hadn&#39;t today received an <a href="http://nokia.com/n91">N91</a> from the <a href="http://n91.bloggercomm.com/">Nokia Blogger Relations program</a> (thanks <a href="http://andyabramson.blogs.com/voipwatch/">Andy</a> and Nokia!), I&#39;d watch Rocketboom on a regular basis now! </p>
<p> Unfortunately, ShoZu :-( doesn&#39;t yet run on the N91!  More on the N91 and ZuCasts later. </p>

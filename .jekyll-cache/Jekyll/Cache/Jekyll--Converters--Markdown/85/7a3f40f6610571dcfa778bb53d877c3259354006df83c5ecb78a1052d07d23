  <li>Read  the whole thing <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters. Love the shaping concept: “Second, we <strong>shape the work</strong> before giving it to a team. A
small senior group works in parallel to the cycle teams. They define 
the key elements of a solution before we consider a project ready to bet
on. Projects are defined at the right level of abstraction: concrete 
enough that the teams know what to do, yet abstract enough that they 
have room to work out the interesting details themselves.”</li>
  <li>I think 6-8 weeks like Mozilla and Basecamp does is about right.</li>
  <li>And there is no one size fits all; each software team will have its own process for scoping and breaking down  features  into manageable as well as useable  chunks.</li>

  <li>This is straightforward. I just use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh">editing over ssh feature</a> to enter the SSH connection command (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -i ~/.ssh/wsl2.pub roland@somehost.tcp.ngrok.io -p &lt;someport&gt;</code>) in Visual Studio Code (and of course I could always use emacs to edit over ssh which I‚Äôve done for decades!).</li>
  <li>And I use the terminal feature to trigger a jekyll rebuild and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">surge</code> to upload my blog and git all in Visual Studio Code‚Äôs terminal.</li>
  <li>Finally I have another ngrok tunnel running that maps port 4000 to port 80 to see the rendered draft version at: https://rytjekyll.ngrok.io/ (userid: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">you</code> password: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rock+2023</code> &lt;‚Äì remove the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign :-) ) I am not sure how long this will remain up (at least until mid February 2023) because I am not sure I can afford to pay for ngrok but we‚Äôll see :-)</li>
  <li>Super geeky :-) but then I can edit on any of my 3 laptops and 2 Raspberry Pis (including my MacBook Air) because this recipe will work on any computer that runs Visual Studio Code.</li>
  <li>Question: Does Typora or any other nice Markdown editor work over SSH? VS Code is fine but not nearly as nice as Typora! Maybe I should try my perennial favourite emacs‚Äôs Markdown mode?</li>

<h2 id="pontifications">Pontifications</h2>

<p>The following pontifications were prompted by Professor Wallingford’s <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2017-01.html#e2017-01-06T16_29_09.htm">blog post about  email hierarchy</a>:</p>

<p><strong>QUOTE</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
"I'm also a POP mail guy. For many years, Eudora was my client of choice. A while back, I switched to Mail.app on OS X. In both, I had an elaborate filing system in which research mail was kept in a separate folder from teaching mail, which was kept in a separate folder from personal was kept in a separate folder from .... There were a dozen or so top-level folders, each having sub-folders.

Soon after I became department head a decade or so ago, I began to experience the downsides of this approach as much as the upsides. Some messages wanted to live in two folders, but I had to choose one. Even when the choice was easy, I found myself spending too many minutes each week filing away messages I would likely never think of again."

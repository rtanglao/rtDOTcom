I"»<p> The Nokia Web Browser based on Apple&#39;s Web Kit works much better on the N93 than the N91. The N93 version doesn&#39;t run out of memory when surfing to flickr unike the N91 version! Yay! Go Nokia go! Now I can finally see what the excitement is about this browser. Intrigued though by<a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/operamini/beta/"> Opera Mini Beta 3.0</a> which I&#39;ll probably try out at some point on the N93. </p>

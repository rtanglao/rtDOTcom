  <p>RAG basically allows the LLM to search the internet for fresh data relevant to the userâ€™s query, enabling it to fetch the most up-to-date information. The LLM can then use its training data to summarize the information retrieved via RAG. Essentially, this combines LLMs and search engines into a single product.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, why do I hate this? Well, itâ€™s basically glorified plagiarism. While Iâ€™d argue LLMs in general are just Plagiarism-as-a-Service, RAG is a lot closer to actual plagiarism that typical LLM behavior. As Iâ€™ve already argued, LLMs donâ€™t think or reason. Thus, all RAG is really doing is using the LLMsâ€™ natural language abilities to summarize or re-word some news article, blog post, or research paper. This deprives the original author of revenue &amp; website traffic, while not transforming their work in any meaningful way.</p>

  <p>So yes, while I may come off as a massive LLM hater, I feel like I have my reasons. With that said, I am still actively researching and experimenting with LLM regularly, and Iâ€™m always open to being proven wrong. But currently, Iâ€™m simply not seeing it. Iâ€™m not seeing heaps of successful LLM products, businesses, or use cases. What Iâ€™m seeing is a lot of shovel selling, and a huge black hole for VC money.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe some day Iâ€™ll write a post about the viability of LLMs for something Iâ€™m building. But it wonâ€™t be today, this year, or likely anytime soon. In fact, Iâ€™m currently still getting job offers for manual reverse engineering jobs. Itâ€™s extremely common for security companies that use machine learning to hire manual analysts. ML models need constant tweaking and updating, which means a huge market for experts who can be a part of that process.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™d expect this is where LLMs will go should the tech take off. Not job replacement, but a shift towards professionals using their experience to fine tune LLMs, instead of doing the work directly. In fact, Iâ€™ve started getting the same offers to consult for LLM companies that I am for traditional ML ones.</p>

  <li>I was inspired by yesterdayâ€™s Cypress Challenge (<a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2610662823">Strava</a>, <a href="https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2019/cypress/view/173">2019 official chip time 1:00:15</a> which was three minutes faster than <a href="https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2018/cypress/view/56">2018</a>; yay fantastic coaching from Brite Coaching and Lotus training!) to write a poem entitled <a href="https://roland.micro.blog/2019/08/12/climbing-to-you.html">Climbing to You</a>:</li>

<pre>
Climbing to you Mom
Just around the corner
At the top of the next hill
I can see your smile and hear your laugh about your world travels
Climbing to you Goong Goong
Just around the corner
At the top of the next hill
I can see your smile and hear your laugh as we eat together
Climbing to you

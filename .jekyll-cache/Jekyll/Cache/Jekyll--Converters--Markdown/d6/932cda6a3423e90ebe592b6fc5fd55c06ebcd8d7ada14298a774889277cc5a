      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A heat dome is caused by a strong ridge of high pressure that traps warm air underneath it. Although not a term commonly used by Environment  Canada scientists, the heat dome gets its name because the ridge acts  like a dome, allowing the sun to crank up the heat below and create a  heat wave that lasts at least a few days.</code></li>

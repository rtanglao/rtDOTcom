When I was building this in December, I would start my evening at about 7:30PM by deploying and having Terraform spin everything up, and then I would have Terraform Cloud destroy whatever inventory was present by 1:30AM. Nonetheless, my bill for December was $130-ish. I realized the Aurora problem, switched to RDS, and got rid of a lot of the Lambdas to simplify the application and consequent bill. I let the new iteration run for almost a month and was headed towards another $120 bill, which I think means the old system would have cost something like $190/month if I hadn’t swapped databases. </code> END QUOTE &lt;– not a very good endorsement of AWS for hobbyist or non enterprise siuations  (via <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/08/07/Apps-Get-Worse">Tim Bray</a>)</p>

The KRZR K1 shortcuts just keep on coming :-) Close the flip. Then, hold the up or down volume key &#38; then hit the camera key to change ring style from Loud to vibrate to silent to the many other ring styles.

I am sure this is not news to the Moto fanatics out there but it's news to me! Nifty feature but not really useful to me. Because I'd prefer a 1 key shortcut to toggle between general and pager. I don't really care about silent and the other ring style combinations!

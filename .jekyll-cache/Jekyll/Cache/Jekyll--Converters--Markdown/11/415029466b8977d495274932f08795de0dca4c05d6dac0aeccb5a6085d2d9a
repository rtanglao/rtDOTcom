Of course this would rankle seasoned developers who want ultimate power and prefer tiny extensible systems. When developers think of advanced type systems, they think of things like Haskellâ€™s scary-powerful primitives for creating new types, not of ecosystem-supported common types.â€ &lt;â€” YESâ€¦.AND Both languages like Google Sheets/Excel/R/python should coexist and complementâ€ lowerâ€ level â€œmore flexibleâ€ languages like Rust and Haskell. Thereâ€™s no such thing as a â€œseasonedâ€ developer for every domain. More like in some domains some software developers donâ€™t mind rolling their own low level abstractions. Most people donâ€™t have the time or need for such things :-) they just want to solve a problem with software.</li>

Doesnâ€™t health, safety and quality of life and less inequality for all matter to entitled, wealthy  ğŸ‡¦mericans :-) ? Evidently not ?!?!</a> &lt;- OMG! Yet another weâ€™re no 1 post from an ğŸ‡¦merican LOL. It is possible to have a far less violent country that takes care of their fellow citizens better through universal healthcare and other things and that â€œinnovatesâ€. Japan is just one example of country that is better on what many people value: it is safer and healthier and people have time for hobbies ie doing something other than working for 50 weeks a year like most i.e. unprivileged ğŸ‡¦mericans :-) who get 2 or 3 weeks of holidays at the most and donâ€™t have the money to buy the stuff that Mr. Smith cares so much about!</p>

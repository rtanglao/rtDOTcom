I"1<p>Amen! Newspapers open your archives! You have nothing to lose and you will gain credibility and authority simply by having something people link to with confidence!</p>
<p>From <a href="http://dangillmor.typepad.com/dan_gillmor_on_grassroots/2005/01/newspapers_open.html">Dan Gillmor on Grassroots Journalism, Etc.: Newspapers: Open Your Archives</a>.:</p>
<p><b>QUOTE</b></p>
<blockquote><p>One of these days, a newspaper currently charging a premium for access to its article archives will do something bold: It will open the archives to the public -- free of charge but with keyword-based advertising at the margins.
</p>
<p>I predict that the result will pleasantly surprise the bean-counters. There'll be a huge increase in traffic at first, once people realize they can read their local history without paying a fee. Eventually, though not instantly, the revenues will greatly exceed what the paper had been earning under the old system. Meanwhile, the expenses to run it will drop.
</p>
<p>And, perhaps most important, the newspaper will have boosted its long-term place in the community. It will be seen, more than ever, as the authoritative place to go for some kinds of news and information -- because it will have become an information bedrock in this too-transient culture.</p></blockquote>

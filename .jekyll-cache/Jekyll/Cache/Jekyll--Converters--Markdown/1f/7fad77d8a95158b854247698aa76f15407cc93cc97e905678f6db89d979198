  <li>Having Surface Book 2 WiFi 802.11ac issues: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipconfig /release</code> and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipconfig /renew</code> in powershell seems to fix it
    <ul>
      <li>the above fix was found by a google search that turned up reddit:<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/7dtr5b/new_surface_book_2_same_bs_marvell_wifi_fails_help/">New Surface Book 2, same BS Marvell WiFi failsâ€¦ (help) </a></li>
      <li>Note: I donâ€™t have these issues with 802.11ac wifi on OS X, Android or iOS (so itâ€™s probably driver related?!?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

Recursion, parallelism, and design patterns weren’t somehow worthier than gardening, brewing, or running marathons; by acting and speaking as though they were, I was alienating people and making computing less accessible.”  &lt;–  I will reluctantly :-) concede that not everybody should learn to program in a traditional language like scheme or python but i still maintain that spreadsheet programming is real programming that EVERYBODY learns and therefore we should make spreadsheets and tools like them much better! e.g. somehow add version control, somehow add tests,etc</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I believe very strongly that    we will only get through the next fifty years    if we start to care about each other and our collective future    more than we do right now.    I also believe that in order to do that,    we need to figure out why we *haven't* cared in the past.    The Internet and modern computing culture    aren't solely responsible for today's woes,    but they're responsible for enough of them    to be worth looking at much more critically than Silicon Valley chooses to &lt;--- </code> YES, we must learn how to co-operate and work together to secure our collective future if we are to survive climate change.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The language usedâ€”technical, detached, and foreignâ€”defines climate change, its risk to vulnerable communities, and how it should be addressed. But does it reflect the reality of Bangladesh, a country on the frontline of the climate crisis?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Bangladesh, the effects of climate change are undeniable, yet the terms imposed by global frameworks often fail to capture the essence of local struggles and experiences. Words like â€˜vulnerability,â€™ â€˜adaptation,â€™ â€˜displacement,â€™ and â€˜dispossessionâ€™ dominate the discourse. These terms, viewed from a Global North perspective, are disconnected from the lived experiences and realities of communities that have adapted to natureâ€™s unpredictability for generations.
More often than not, it is those in positions of power who construct knowledge. Michel Foucaultâ€™s concept of knowledge/power in discourse analysis can be used to explain this dynamic. Foucault argued that power and knowledge are inextricably linked and mutually reinforcing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While global reports may hail â€˜alternative livelihoodâ€™ or â€˜community empowermentâ€™ as solutions, the Sundarbansâ€™ honey collectors or Shyanmagarâ€™s farmers may see these as distant concepts that neither acknowledge nor address their immediate struggles.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This mismatch between global definitions and local knowledge isnâ€™t just a matter of semantics; it shapes policies, funding priorities, and , ultimately, who gets to decide the future of countries like Bangladesh.
More often than not, it is those in positions of power who construct knowledge.</p>

  <li>During this pandemic I have discovered that for me, bicycling and cross country skiing are great outlets and necessary outlets to lessen my blues and just to clear my mind. In addition they are super fun things I have been doing forever :-) Bicycling since I was 4 or 5, cross country skiing since I was 24!</li>
  <li>This year both the <a href="https://cyclingbc.net/event/glotman-simpson-cypress-challenge/">Cypress Challenge for Pancreatic Cancer</a> and the Tour de Cure were virtual. I love the longer rides and I love the charity rides. I don’t do non charity long rides so these are the biggest rides of the year for me. Thanks to the generous folks who sponsored me during this difficult time and when there are so many other worthy causes! During both rides I thought of my Mother who died of pancreatic cancer in 2013 and my Dad who died in 2015 of liver cancer. Pancreatic Cancer in particular is deadly and the Cypress Challenge is funding amazing reasearch here in BC.</li>
  <li>I didn’t manage to complete the Cypress Challenge on the designated days but did Cypress as part of my “Triple crown”.</li>
  <li>Thanks to Sandra, Jaqui, Ben and Andy for riding with me! You are all super great riding companions!</li>
  <li>Powered by Almond butter and Banana Sandwiches. hat tip to Sandra for suggesting this! Works for me. #ymmv</li>
  <li>Thanks to the Lotus Road Bicycling club and Brite Coaching for the fantastic coaching. All those training sessions and tips and Saturday rides have made me a much more aware and better bicyclist whether I am on my road bicycle or not.</li>
  <li>Hydration by Precision Hydration! I think I have been dehydrated my entire life when exerciging until I heard about PH from the fine Lotus folks. It makes a huge difference to hydrate one or two days before an event!</li>
